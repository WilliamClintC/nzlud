Marconi Park Complex Advisory Board

advisory board to be known as the "Marconi Park Complex Advisory Board
of the Township of Wall."
§ 6-39. Membership.
A. In 1990, the United States Government declared Camp Evans a surplus
Army facility and determined that it would be closed by the end of 1998.
Following this announcement, the Township formed the Marconi Park
Complex Advisory Committee to serve as the designated local
redevelopment authority responsible for creating a reuse master plan
for Camp Evans. The Marconi Park Complex Advisory Committee met
on a regular basis to study the property in question; to conduct
investigations; and to hold public hearings regarding potential reuses
of the property. Following considerable research, evaluation and public
hearings, the Marconi Park Complex Advisory Committee presented its
reuse plan to the Township Committee, which plan was adopted in
January 1996.
B. The reuse plan represents the Township's strategy, approved by the
appropriate federal agencies, for conversion of Camp Evans into the
Marconi Park Complex as a long-term community asset. These 258
acres of land located completely within the boundaries of Wall Township
provide a unique opportunity for the Township and its residents.
C. Under the reuse plan, a portion of the former Camp Evans property has
been conveyed to Brookdale Community College for educational
purposes. Other portions have been designated for historic
preservation, museum and educational purposes and have been or are
about to be transferred to the Township of Wall and leased to the
InfoAge Learning Center. A substantial additional portion of the former
Camp Evans property has been transferred to the Township of Wall for
passive recreation purposes, and a portion has been transferred to the
Township for active recreation purposes.
D. In furthering the goals of the reuse plan, the Township Committee
believes it important to offer existing volunteer advisory boards and
committees the ability to provide advice and assist in furthering the
designated purposes of the Marconi Park Complex.
A. The Board shall consist of eight members and such additional members
as may be deemed appropriate by resolution of the Township
Committee. [Amended 5-14-2008 by Ord. No. 7-2008]

terms, except for the Township Committee member, who shall be
appointed or reappointed to a one-year term.
C. Three of the members of the Advisory Board shall be residents of the
geographic area of the Township surrounding the Marconi Park
Complex. One member shall be a representative of the InfoAge

§ 33-1. Establishment of policies.
There is hereby established in and for this Township the following personnel
policies relating to all present and future municipal employees of this
Township.
§ 33-2. General personnel policy.
The purpose of these personnel policies is:
A. To seek and to obtain for each position to be filled the highest and best
qualified person available, and to employ individuals without regard to
race, color, creed, national origin, sex, age, or religious or sexual
preference.
B. To provide for all employees the best possible direction, leadership,
training, supervision, guidance, instruction and working conditions.

there is an opportunity for advancement.
F. To treat every employee with the justice, respect, courtesy and
consideration properly due him.
G. To expect and require every employee consistently to do the best work
of which he is capable; to be loyal and conscientious at all times; to
conduct himself in a proper manner; and to treat all with whom he
comes in contact with the same consideration and courtesy that he
could reasonably expect from them.
H. To urge the self-betterment of every employee; to encourage him to
study and seek all possible means of increasing his value, both to his
community and to himself.
I. To pay fair and adequate salaries for each position, and in return to

§ 33-1 GIFTS TO TOWNSHIP § 33-2
23:75
§ 33-3. General employment practices.
The following general employment practices shall be followed in this
Township:
K. To inculcate and to maintain in every employee of the Township a
feeling of pride in himself and his employer, as well as satisfaction
because he serves, and is an important part of, one of the finest
communities in the State of New Jersey.
A. Creation of new positions. The Township Committee shall formally
effect the creation of any new position and authorize the filling of any
such position, prior to any employment or engagement of any employee,
either by establishing the position in the annual budget and Salary
Ordinance or by action taken at any regular meeting of the Township
Committee. There shall be provided in the current budget or otherwise
specific and adequate funds to compensate an employee before his or
her engagement. This provision shall not, however, prevent the
temporary hiring of any employee between Township Committee
meetings, subject to approval at the next regular Township Committee
meeting.
B. Filling vacancy open six months. The Township Administrator shall
examine the need for the hiring of an employee or the filling of a
vacancy which has existed for over six months in any previously
authorized or established full-time position and shall report to the
Township Committee before any action is initiated to fill the same.
C. Notice of job opening. Whenever a vacancy exists or a new position is
created, a notice of the same will be posted in the Municipal Building,
the Department of Public Works and police headquarters for at least
one week prior to the deadline for receiving applications. All Township
employees who believe they possess the necessary qualifications may
apply for the position, if they so desire. Such applications should be by
letter, addressed to the Township Administrator and filed before the
deadline specified. Due consideration shall be given by the department
head or heads effected and by the Township Administrator of each
requested transfer of an employee from one department to another, and
the parties shall also consider the overall welfare of the Township in
considering and making employee transfers. The Township at all times,
however, reserves the right to reject any and all requests for such
transfer and to publicly advertise for any vacant or new position.
D. Application forms. Application forms for employment as approved by
the Township Administrator may be obtained in the office of the
Township Clerk and shall be completed by all persons applying for
employment with the Township. The application form shall contain a
release authorizing the Township to conduct appropriate background
investigations, including an examination of the applicant's driving
record, and the applicant shall be required to provide his or her driver's
license number on the application form.
§ 33-2 WALL CODE § 33-3
23:76
E. Consideration by department heads. As soon as practical after the final
date specified for filing, all such applications received, including those
from Township employees, will be considered by the department head
involved and the Township Administrator.
F. Interview by Township Administrator. The Township Administrator shall
personally interview the applicants for Township employment who
appear to be best qualified for the position and able to perform the
duties thereof, and will make a written recommendation to the
Township Committee relative to the appointment. The Township
Administrator will interview only those applicants who the
Administrator, in his discretion, deems qualified for a position. The
Township Committee shall make the final determination whether to
appoint, engage or hire the applicant recommended by the Township
Administrator, subject to a satisfactory medical examination in the case
of public works, Police Department and recreation employees and any
further investigation of references as deemed necessary by the
Township Committee. The hiring of any other employee shall be subject
to a satisfactory medical examination when deemed necessary or
appropriate by the Township Administrator or the Township Committee.
G. Layoff and recall policy.
(1) General statement. In the event it is determined that a reduction in
the work force will take place, the Township will consider such
factors as length of service, qualifications, experience, work history
and its operational needs in determining which employees will be
affected.
(2) Layoff policy. General determinations of which employee(s) will be
laid off will be conducted on a job classification and functional
basis.
(a) Temporary employees and/or employees who have not yet
completed their probationary period of employment in any
affected position will generally be terminated prior to the layoff
of any regular full-time or part-time employee in that position.
Exceptions may arise where removing full-time or part-time
employees who do not have requisite skills and/or abilities
necessary to perform the jobs previously performed by such
temporary or short-term employees may be necessary,
particularly where the position is directed by state statute.
(b) Where there is more than one regular full-time and/or parttime
employee in a position affected by a reduction in work
force, the Township will consider such factors as work record,
past attendance, qualification, skill, experience, overall
flexibility within the department and length of service with the
Township and/or in the position, in determining which
employee or employees will be laid off.
§ 33-3 GIFTS TO TOWNSHIP § 33-3
23:77
(3) Recall policy. Generally, employees with the longest service in a
position to be filled will be recalled to that position first, if and
when increases in that position occur.
(a) Regular full-time and part-time employees who are laid off due
to a staff reduction may be extended an invitation to return to
work following the layoff in the event the Township determines
an increase in staff is warranted. This invitation will normally
be offered for only three days after a layoff period.
(b) Employee recall opportunities will expire after one year
following a layoff or for a period equal to the employee's most
recent length of continuous service with the Township,
whichever is sooner.
(c) Employees who are recalled and begin employment within the
applicable period will retain credit for past continuous service
up to the date of layoff for purposes of such benefits as
vacation earning, rates and similar benefits. The period of
layoff is not counted as continuous length of service in a
computation of longevity payments.
(d) Employees who are not recalled within the relevant period or
refuse an offer of reemployment will be considered terminated
as of the end of the relevant period or as of the date of refusal,
whichever is applicable.
(e) Temporary employees and employees on probation when staff
reductions occur will be terminated and will normally not be
extended any recall privileges.
(f) The affirmative action officer shall review decisions made
concerning specific personnel to be laid off or recalled for
compliance with equal employment opportunity laws.
(g) Medical and other insurance benefits shall continue for fulltime
laid-off personnel, for one month after the month in which
they are terminated.
H. Basis for appointment. Appointments to Township employment shall be
made on the basis of information contained in the application for
employment and such other information as may be obtained in the
personal interview or employment investigation process. Any
misstatement or withholding of pertinent information by the applicant
will be considered as sufficient cause for immediate separation from the
service of the Township.
I. Probationary service. Except where statutory requirements direct
otherwise, all new, rehired or transferred employees, except those
covered by collective bargaining agreements, shall serve a period of
probation of a minimum of 90 days. New hires in an entry-level position
will have a probationary period of one year. Within that time frame, two
§ 33-3 WALL CODE § 33-3
23:78
reviews shall take place with feedback on work performance. All entrylevel
positions will have the possibility of increases not to exceed
$1,000 each based on the two performance reviews during the oneyear
probationary time. "Entry-level" positions shall be defined as those
that do not require a certification or degree. All full-time employees
shall be entitled to insurance and sick leave benefits commencing on
the first day of the month following the first 30 days of employment.
All full-time employees shall be entitled to the other personnel benefits
of this article commencing on the 31st day of employment. [Amended

and records for completeness and establish a personnel file for each

only permanent full-time employees, elected officials and part-time

(a) Regular part-time employees are defined as those who work an

calendar quarter. In lieu of all earned time provisions
contained elsewhere in this article, such employees will be
entitled to eight hours of paid time off per calendar quarter.
(b) Part-time employees will not be entitled to longevity.
L. Exceptions; personnel covered by collective bargaining agreements.
The benefits, rules and regulations of this article shall apply to all
Township personnel defined above except those covered by collective
bargaining agreements entered into between the Township Committee
and duly recognized collective bargaining units of the Township.
Anything set forth in the collective bargaining agreements inconsistent
with the provisions of the personnel chapter shall be controlled by the
collective bargaining agreements. Any subject matters of the personnel
chapter which are not covered in the collective bargaining agreements
shall be controlled by this personnel chapter.
M. Whistle-blower policy. The Township shall not take any retaliatory
action against an employee because the employee does any of the
following:
(1) Disclose or threaten to disclose to a supervisor or a member of the
governing body or to a public body, as defined in the Employment
Protection Act (N.J.S.A. 34:19-1 et seq.), an activity, policy or
practice of the Township that the employee reasonably believes is
in violation of a law, or Township policy.
§ 33-3 GIFTS TO TOWNSHIP § 33-3

conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation of

Township.
(3) Objects to or refuses to participate in any activity, policy or practice
which the employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, or a
rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law; is fraudulent or
criminal; or is incompatible with a clear mandate of public policy
concerning the public health, safety, or welfare.
(4) Procedure. In accordance with the state statute, the employee must
bring the activity, policy or practice in violation of a law, or a rule or
regulation promulgated pursuant to law to the attention of a
supervisor or the employee, a department head, or the personal
officer by written notice.
(a) The employee shall grant the Township a reasonable
opportunity to correct the activity, policy or practice.
(b) Disclosure shall not be required where the employee is
reasonably certain that the activity, policy or practice is known
to one or more supervisors of the Township or where the
employee reasonably fears physical harm as a result of the
disclosure or where the situation is emergent in nature.
(c) The Township will not tolerate any retaliatory action taken by
any employee, supervisor, or elected official as a result of
bringing the activity to its attention.
(d) In accordance with statute, a copy of this policy of the
Township employees' protections and obligations shall be
posted in all Township facilities.
N. Contagious disease policy.
(1) It shall be an unlawful practice for the Township, or any employee,
or supervisor to do or attempt to do any of the following as a result
of the fact, in whole or in part, that a person has AIDS, associated
conditions or any other contagious disease:
(a) Fail to refuse to hire, or to discharge any person, or otherwise
to discriminate against any person with respect to
compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment.
(b) Limit, segregate or classify employees or applicants for
employment in any manner which would deprive or tend to
deprive any person of employment opportunities, or adversely
affect his or her employment status.

to discriminate against any person.
§ 33-3 WALL CODE § 33-3
23:80
(d) Discriminate against any person in admission to, or
employment in, any program established to provide
apprenticeship or other training or retraining, including any
on-the-job training program.
(2) Bona fide occupational qualification not prohibited; burden of
proof.
(a) Nothing contained in this section shall be determined to
prohibit the selection, rejection or dismissal of an employee
based upon a bona fide occupational qualification. A bona fide
occupational qualification exists under this section where the
Township can demonstrate that the absence of AIDS or other
contagious disease is reasonably necessary to the essence of
the Township's business and that all or substantially all
persons with AIDS or other contagious disease are unable to
perform the duties of the position in question without harm to
themselves or others.
(b) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit the
selection, rejection, or assignment of an employee where,
because a person has AIDS or other contagious disease, he/she
is unable to perform his or her duties, or is unable to perform
such duties in a manner that would not endanger his or her
health or safety or the health or safety of others.
(c) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit the
selection or rejection of an applicant for employment where it
can be demonstrated that the Township is unable to reasonably
accommodate a person who has AIDS or other contagious
disease, without undue hardship on the conduct of the
Township's business.
(d) In any action brought under this policy, if a party asserts that
an otherwise unlawful discriminatory practice is justified as a
bona fide occupational qualification, that party shall have the
burden of proving:
[1] That the discrimination is in fact the necessary result of a
bona fide occupational qualification;
[2] That there exists no less discriminatory means of
satisfying the occupational qualification.
(3) Exceptions. It shall not be an unlawful discriminatory practice for
the Township to observe the conditions of a bona fide employee
benefit system, provided that such systems or plans are not a
subterfuge to evade the purposes of this section.
(4) Township's facilities and services.
§ 33-3 GIFTS TO TOWNSHIP § 33-3
23:81
(a) It shall be an unlawful practice for any employee to deny any
person the full and equal enjoyment of, or to impose different
terms and conditions on the availability of any of the following,
as a result of the fact, in whole or in part, that a person has
AIDS or other contagious disease:
[1] Use of any Township facilities or service.
[2] Any service, program or facility, wholly or partially funded
or otherwise supported by the Township.
(b) Exceptions set forth in Subsection N(2) above, entitled "Bona
fide occupational qualification not prohibited; burden of proof,"
are also applicable to this subsection on Township facilities and
services.
(5) Health and safety exception affirmative defense. The affirmative
defenses described herein shall be applicable to the preceding
sections. In any action brought by a party asserts that an otherwise
unlawful discriminatory practice is justified as necessary to protect
the health or safety of a person who has AIDS or other contagious
disease or associated conditions or the health and safety of the
general public, that party must establish a defense by proving:
(a) That the discriminatory act is necessary to avoid an imminent
and substantial risk to a person who has AIDS or other
contagious diseases, or associated conditions; or
(b) That the discriminatory act is necessary to avoid a danger to
other significantly greater than that posed by persons without
AIDS, or other contagious diseases; and
(c) That there exists no less discriminatory means of protecting
health and safety.
(6) The Township shall not require any person to take a test or undergo
any medical procedure designed to show or help to show that a
person has AIDS or other contagious disease or any of the
associated conditions covered by this policy. This does not apply if
the Township can show that the absence of AIDS or contagious
disease is a bona fide occupational qualification as defined herein.
O. Drug and alcohol policy.
(1) It is the Township of Wall's policy to provide its employees with a
work environment that is free from the effects of illegal drugs and
alcohol. Employees of Wall Township are responsible for
cooperating and actively participating in the effort to keep illegal
drugs and alcohol out of the workplace and to maintain a work
environment free from the effects of illegal drugs and alcohol.
(2) As a result, the use, sale, possession, distribution, control, and
transportation of illegal drugs or being under the influence of
§ 33-3 WALL CODE § 33-3
23:82
alcohol or illegal drugs on the job or on the employer's property
is prohibited. Employees who violate this prohibition or who are
involved in illegal drug activities whether on or off the job will be
subject to disciplinary action by the employer up to and including
discharge.
(3) While recognizing that employees are responsible for making their
own lifestyle choices, the employer will not accept even small risks
that on-the-job or off-the-job drug use by employees might cause or
contribute to accidents or other safety or performance problems.
Recognizing that any measurable amount of an illegal drug in a
person's body can put that person under the influence of the drug
to some degree, even if the impairment is not readily apparent to
the layman, the employer's policy regarding drugs strives for, and
requires, a "drug-free" work force.
P. Sexual harassment policy.
(1) General statement of policy. Sexual harassment is a form of sex
discrimination. It is the policy of the employer to maintain a
learning and working environment that is free from sexual
harassment. The employer prohibits any form of sexual
harassment.
(2) It shall be a violation of this policy for any employee of the
employer to harass an employee through conduct or
communication of a sexual nature as defined by this policy.
(3) The employer will investigate all complaints, formal or informal,
verbal or written, of sexual harassment and discipline any
employee who sexually harasses another employee of the employer.
(4) Sexual harassment defined.
(a) Sexual harassment consists of unwelcome sexual advances,
requests for sexual favors, sexually motivated physical conduct
or other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a
sexual nature when:
[1] Submissions to that conduct or communication is made a
term or condition, either explicitly or implicitly, of
obtaining or retaining employment; or
[2] Submission to or rejection of that conduct or
communication by an individual is used as a factor in
decisions affecting that individual's employment; or
[3] That conduct or communication has the purpose or effect
of substantially or unreasonably interfering with an
individual's employment, or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive employment environment.
§ 33-3 GIFTS TO TOWNSHIP § 33-3
23:83
(b) Any sexual harassment as defined when perpetrated on an
employee by any employee will be treated as sexual
harassment under this policy.
(5) Sexual harassment may include but is not limited to:
(a) Verbal harassment or abuse;
(b) Subtle pressure for sexual activity;
(c) Inappropriate patting or pinching;
(d) Intentional brushing against an employee's body;
(e) Demand for sexual favors accompanied by an implied or overt
threat concerning an individual's employment;
(f) Demand for sexual favors accompanied by an implied or overt
promise of preferential treatment with regard to an
individual's employment status; or
(g) Any unwelcome sexually motivated touching.
(6) Reporting. All employees have a right and are encouraged to
informally or formally report any and all statements, acts, or
behavior by a coemployee or employees, supervisory employees,
elected officials or visitors.
(a) Informal complaints.
[1] A complaint should be reported to the supervisor of the
department in which the employee works who in turn shall
report the complaint to the Personnel Officer. The
Personnel Officer, working with the supervisor, is
responsible for investigating information charges and
arranging a mutually satisfactory disposition. the
Personnel Officer or supervisor may speak informally with
the alleged harasser in an effort to correct the offending
behavior and prevent retaliatory behavior. It should be
stated firmly and clearly that the behavior is unwelcome.
[2] In case either the Personnel officer or supervisor is
involved in the complaint, the matter shall be reported to
the Township Administrator. If the employee feels the
complaint cannot be brought to the Township
Administrator, such complaint may be made to the
Township Committee, but any complaint not made to the
employee's immediate supervisor must be accompanied by
the sworn statement of the complainant that the persons
to whom the complaint should otherwise have been
directed cannot, in the mind of the complainant, be
objective about the sexual harassment charge.
§ 33-3 WALL CODE § 33-3
23:84
[3] If the complainant is informed by his/her supervisor or the
Personnel Officer that said persons are not, within the
confines of the disposition of the complaint, able to
arrange a mutually satisfactory disposition, the
complainant may file a formal complaint.
(b) Formal complaints.
[1] An individual alleging sexual harassment may file a formal
complaint with the Personnel Officer in writing within 45
days of the incident. In case the Personnel Officer is
involved in the complaint, the matter shall be reported to
the Township Administrator. If the employee feels the
complaint cannot be brought to the Township
Administrator, such complaint may be made to the
Township Committee, but any complaint not made to the
Personnel Officer, must be accompanied by the sworn
statement of the complainant that the persons to whom the
complaint should otherwise have been directed cannot, in
the mind of the complainant, be objective about the sexual
harassment charge.
[2] A formal complaint may also be lodged verbally; however,
the Personnel Officer shall then summarize the verbal
allegations, including the date, time and place that the
employee made the complaint, and specific allegations of
the employee, in writing, and the employee must affirm the
accuracy of the information by signing such.
(c) Investigations.
[1] Complaints will be kept confidential to the extent possible;
however, anonymity cannot be guaranteed if action must
be taken against the wrongdoer as testimony of the victim
may be necessary or where law requires disclosure.
[2] The Personnel Officer shall promptly conduct an
investigation of the allegations in the complaint. Upon
completion of the investigation, the Personnel Officer shall
issue a determination setting forth the findings in the
matter and recommending an action to the Township
Administrator.
[3] The investigation shall include the taking of statements
from the complainant and taking statements from any
witnesses and coworkers, as well as the alleged harasser.
The objective of the investigation is to obtain the basis for
the complaint while giving fair notice to the accused of the
facts upon which the complaint is based.
(d) Discipline. Any employee who violates this policy will be
subject to appropriate discipline. This may include dismissal,

Consistent with the Township's policy of equal employment opportunity,
harassment of employees or job applicants based on their race, sex,
religion, national origin, age, marital status, sexual or affectional

While it is not easy to define harassment, harassment includes slurs,
epithets, threats, unwelcome phone calls, derogatory comments,

is eliminated from the work place, the Township utilizes the same
complaint procedure described in Subsection P concerning sexual
harassment for complaints of harassment based on these factors as

Township's obligation to serve the public and the frequent contact
by Township employees with members of the public, such

(8) Each employee must take his authorized annual vacation during
each calendar year and shall not be permitted to accumulate the
same from year to year, except that the Township Administrator, in
his discretion, may permit the carry over of vacation time into the

vacation time will not be allowed. Each employee shall submit a
written request to the department head and each department head
shall submit a written request to the Township Administrator for
approval of the specific dates for the employee's annual vacation.

23:92
observed. When a holiday falls on a Sunday, the succeeding

F. Sick leave. [Amended 5-12-2004 by Ord. No. 8-2004; 3-26-2014 by
Ord. No. 4-2014; 12-28-2016 by Ord. No. 17-2016]

(a) Sick leave with pay shall be credited each permanent full-time
employee on the basis of one day per month of continuous
service, with no maximum limit, and commencing from January
1, 1969, or date of employment, whichever is later. Upon
separation in good standing from service, each permanent fulltime
employee shall be entitled to 1/2 day's pay, at the rate of
pay in effect at the time of separation, for each full day of
unused accumulated sick leave up to a maximum of 120 days'
accumulated sick leave; provided, however, that the monetary
compensation to be paid for unused accumulated sick leave
shall not exceed $7,500 per employee. The accumulation of

hereof. For all employees hired after January 1, 2017, the
maximum compensation paid for unused sick days utilizing the
above formula shall be $5,000.
(b) The provisions of Subsection F(1)(a) above limiting the number
of days of sick leave which may be accumulated and limiting
the monetary compensation therefor shall not apply to
employees hired prior to January 1, 1980. Each permanent,
full-time employee hired prior to January 1, 1980, shall be
entitled, at the time of separation, to receive 1/2 day's pay, at
the rate of pay in effect at the time of separation, for each day
of unused, accumulated sick leave which the employee has
accumulated as of November 1, 1990, up to a maximum of 250
days' accumulated sick leave. Such employees shall not be
entitled to accumulate sick leave after November 1, 1990.
(2) In all cases of reported illness or disability, the Township reserves
the right to have a physician designated by the Township to
examine and report on the condition of the patient-employee to the
department head and Township Committee.
(3) When the absence on account of illness or disability does not
exceed two days, normally the employee's statement of the cause
will be accepted without a supporting statement from his attending
physician, although the Township may have any employee
examined by a licensed physician at any time if it elects to do so.
The Township also reserves the right to waive this requirement or
to require the employee to be examined by a physician designated
by the Township and to have the employee certified as fit for duty
before the employee returns to work.
§ 33-6 GIFTS TO TOWNSHIP § 33-6
23:93
(4) During protracted periods of illness or disability, the Township may
require interim reports on the condition of the patient, at weekly or
biweekly periods, from the attending physician and/or a physician
designated by the Township. When under medical care, employees
are expected to conform to the instruction of the attending
physician if they wish to qualify for salary payment during such
period of illness or disability. For the purposes of receiving
disability insurance, this subsection shall be administered in
accordance with § 33-12 of this chapter.
(5) The Personnel Coordinator will receive record cards for each
employee, upon which he will record the total sick leave. All
absences will be maintained upon these cards, and all sick leave
earned and consumed or used for each completed continuous
service year will be shown on this record. Employees having
exhausted all of their sick leave will not receive any further sick
leave or compensation in lieu thereof until same has been
accumulated and earned by the employee's subsequent service.
(6) Where employees have left the Township's employ and
subsequently are reemployed, the date of reemployment is to be
used as employees' service date with the Township for purposes of
crediting sick leave.
(7) Sick leave may be allowed for ordinary dental care and for the
service of an oculist for normal eye care when such professional
services are not readily available outside of work hours.
(8) An employee who is certified as absent on account of a disability or
accident caused in the usual hours of his employment and directly
in the line of duty shall not have such absence charged against his
sick leave.
(9) Any employee on sick leave, and receiving his normal
compensation, who, in addition, qualifies for payments under
workers' compensation weekly benefits, shall during the period he
is receiving such weekly benefits be entitled only to that portion of
his regular salary which, with the workers' compensation
payments, equal his normal salary.
(10) Nothing contained herein shall be considered to be in derogation of
or restrictive of any statute now in effect limiting the period during
which Township employees may be compensated for leave on
account of disability or of illness (such as N.J.S.A. 40:11-8 and
40:11-9,7 pertaining to the Police Department) but these provisions
are to be construed and administered in conjunction therewith.
(11) Any employee who has completed at least 21 years of full-time
employment with the Township and has filed a written letter of
7. Editors Note: N.J.S.A. 40:11-8 and 40:11-9 were repealed by L. 1971, c. 200 (§ 40A:9-22),
and L. 1971, c. 197 (§ 40A:14-176), respectively, effective July 1, 1971.
§ 33-6 WALL CODE § 33-6
23:94
resignation or retirement with the Township Clerk which is to be
effective in the second or third calendar year subsequent to when it
was filed may file an election to have accumulated sick leave paid to
the employee before separation under the following circumstances:
(a) The election must be filed by December 1 of the calendar year
preceding the first year within which payment is sought.
(b) The election must state whether payment is to occur over two
or three years. Payment shall be made in equal payments.
(c) The value of a sick day will be calculated for the year in which
the payment is made.
(d) In order to receive a payment in any year, the employee's
employment must be and remain in good standing.
(e) The election may be made only once by any employee. If the
employee does not retire as stated in the notice of election,
those days for which the employee has already been paid shall
be permanently subtracted from his or her sick leave
entitlement.
(f) The election of payment is irrevocable. In the case of death of
an employee before the full payment provided for in the
election, the remaining sums will be paid to the employee's
estate.
(g) As part of the election, and if the employee so indicates, in
writing, at the time of the election, the amounts to be paid
hereunder may be paid to the employee's deferred
compensation account, to the extent provided by law.
G. Family leave. In the case of an employee with a newly born or adopted
child or a seriously ill family member, family leave may be granted
pursuant to the provisions of the Family Leave Act, N.J.S.A. 34:11B-1 et
seq. Maternity leave without pay may also be granted to Township
employees during a term of pregnancy, subject to the approval of the
Township Committee.
H. Jury duty. It is the public policy of this Township to encourage Township
employees to perform all their duties and responsibilities of citizenship
and accordingly if any Township employee is legally selected for jury
duty, every effort shall be made to enable such employee to serve as
juror. To that end the department heads of the Township government
shall use every reasonable endeavor to aid the employee in performing
jury duty. Each employee shall be paid for time served as juror in such
amount as will compensate the employee for any loss sustained by the
employee, being the difference between the amount of salary and jurors
compensation for the days required in service as juror.
§ 33-6 GIFTS TO TOWNSHIP § 33-6
23:95
I. Bereavement. In the event of a death in the immediate family of an
employee (spouse, children, parents, brothers, sisters, grandparents,
spouse's parents, or grandparents of spouse), the Township will grant a
three-day leave of absence with pay to the employee. In the event of a
death of any other relative, the Township will grant a one-day leave of
absence with pay to the employee. If additional time is necessary in
order to manage the affairs related to this death, the employee may
utilize additional benefit time (i.e., sick, vacation, personal), up to a
maximum of five days, with an explanation to be submitted to their
respective department head. [Amended 12-28-2016 by Ord. No.
17-2016]
J. Personal days. All Township employees, not covered by a collective
bargaining agreement, shall be entitled to take up to four days off per
year with pay so as to conduct those personal matters which can only be
conducted on regular business days. The election of days to be taken
shall be subject to advance approval by the employee's department
head. Personal days shall not be accumulated from year to year.
K. Military leave. [Amended 3-9-2005 by Ord. No. 6-2005; 9-14-2005
by Ord. No. 26-2005]
(1) Policy. It is the policy of the Township to prevent, to the extent
practical, economic disruption to those employees who serve in the
reserves of any component of the military service of the United
States, or in the National Guard, who are called, as a result of such
service, to a period of federal or state active duty.
(2) "Activated reservist" or "militia member" defined. As used in this
section, "activated reservist" or "militia member" means any
individual currently serving in the reserves of any branch of the
United States Armed Services or in the organized State Militia
consisting of the Air and Army National Guard, Naval Militia, and
State Guard of New Jersey, or of any other state, who receives,
pursuant to that service, orders to be engaged in a period of federal
or state active duty.
(3) "Active duty" definitions.
(a) "Federal active duty," as used in this section, means active duty
and active duty for training as defined by state law, and, as
ordered by the federal government, but does not include
weekend drills.
(b) "State active duty," as used in this section, means active duty
and active duty for training as defined by state law, and, as
ordered by the state government, but does not include
weekend drills.
(4) Differential pay. Following exhaustion of any statutory entitlements
to full Township pay, an activated reservist or militia member shall
be entitled to differential pay as follows:
§ 33-6 WALL CODE § 33-6
23:96
(a) Differential pay calculated. Upon presentation of the orders to
federal active duty or state active duty of the activated
reservist or militia member to the Township, the Township
shall calculate the amount necessary to be added to that
employee's military pay over the course of his entire activation
which, when added to the military pay, will equal what the
activated reservist or militia member would have received had
he been paid at the municipal salary for that period. In
determining that amount, the Township shall not include the
amount of the military pay received by the employee during the
period of statutory entitlement to both military and municipal
pay in any and all calendar years that the entitlement arises.
(b) Differential pay procedure. Once the above amount is
calculated, upon exhaustion of the period provided by statute
for both municipal and military pay, the Township shall pay to
the activated reservist or militia member the differential pay
amount evenly divided among the pay periods from the close of
the statutory period until either the end of the calendar year or
the end of the activation, whichever is earlier. If the payments
end at the close of the calendar year, they shall resume again
once the new entitlement to both municipal and military pay in
the new calendar year under statute expires, and the activated
reservist or militia member would otherwise be receiving only
the military pay. If the activation is for a longer or shorter
period of time than anticipated, appropriate adjustment shall
be made at the close of the activation to ensure the activated
reservist or militia member receives what he or she would have
received if the activation had not occurred. Such adjustment
shall be accomplished by further payments or withholdings in
the case of overpayment.
(5) The Chief Financial Officer shall apply for reimbursement for any
amounts of military pay the Township must expend if the Township
is eligible for same pursuant to N.J.S.A. 52:13H-2.1 or any other
state or federal law or regulation.
L. Medical leave. Whenever an employee is unable, due to a medical
disability, certified in writing to the Township Administrator by a
physician licensed to practice in the State of New Jersey, to perform all
of the duties and responsibilities of his or her Township employment,
the employee shall be eligible for medical leave without pay for a period
not to exceed six months.
M. Effect and length of unpaid leaves of absence. During an unpaid leave of
absence, an employee will not accumulate any leave, vacation time or
other entitlements dependent upon length of service. If the absence of
an employee on medical leave exceeds six months or the absence of an
employee on family leave exceeds three months, the employee's

requests a transfer from one position or department to another, such

head or department heads involved with the proposed transfer and the

be received and considered before the transfer of employee is effected.

training class or seminar. Other Township employees required to attend
such training classes or seminars, upon the approval of the Township
Administrator, will be paid at regular pay rates for such attendance.

employee is not conforming to the letter or spirit of the Township
policies and rules, or to specific instruction given him, or is in violation
of any of the rules or regulations thereof, the department head shall
first privately discuss this matter with the employee concerned, in
order to obtain the employee's side of the matter. The department head
shall, if possible, then obtain assurance that there will not be a
repetition of the incident, if it is not sufficient to warrant the employee's
dismissal from Township employment. A note or memorandum of the
incident and its disposition shall be placed upon the employee's
personal history file by the department head.
B. Matters of minor importance. If the matter is not a serious one, and the
department head is satisfied to thereby close the incident, the matter

statutes now in effect or which may be hereafter adopted.

persons. A written report of such investigation, the findings and action
taken, supported by available data, will be forwarded to the employee.
G. Filing of papers required. All papers in connection with a disciplinary
action will be placed in the employee's personal history file.
H. Appeal of disciplinary action. Any employee may appeal a disciplinary

who shall make the final determination regarding all disciplinary
matters. Disciplinary actions taken by the Township Administrator may
be appealed as provided by law.
I. Interim suspension. During the pendency of a disciplinary investigation,

temporarily suspend an employee, with or without pay, until the
disciplinary investigation is completed.

separation from service, pursuant to Subsection D(6), the Township
Administrator shall consider the seriousness of the offense, the

for the cost savings to the Township resulting from the employee's
decision not to participate in such insurance programs. Such additional
compensation shall not exceed the amount established from time to
time by resolution of the Township Committee, and this benefit program

member from the Borough of Brielle; one member from the Borough of
Spring Lake; one member from the Borough of Spring Lake Heights and one
member from the Borough of Sea Girt.

The Authority shall possess such powers as authorized by law and approved

Upon creation of the Authority in accordance with applicable law, the

The Authority shall be governed by the bylaws established by the Authority.
A. The municipalities of the Boroughs of Brielle, Spring Lake, Spring Lake

water purchasers") are currently parties to individual treated water
purchase contracts dated September 1, 1987, between the respective
municipalities and the Monmouth County Improvement Authority
("Treated Water Purchase Contract"). The current relationship amongst
the treated water purchasers is in the nature of an interlocal services
arrangement intended to collectively benefit all Treated Water
Purchasers. Section 17 of the Treated Water Purchase Contract grants
an option to the treated water purchasers to purchase the water
treatment and transmission facilities from the Monmouth County
Improvement Authority.
B. The governing body of the Township of Wall and the governing bodies of
the other treated water purchasers have determined that their
respective financial interests and thereby the interests of their
residents would be better served and furthered by establishing a joint
entity comprised of representatives of the treated water purchasers for
the purpose of purchasing the water treatment and transmission
facilities from the Monmouth County Improvement Authority. The
intent and purpose of this enactment is to establish the joint authority.

Geographic Distribution of Alcoholic Beverage Licenses
[Adopted 11-12-2003 by Ord. No. 36-2003]
§ 62-28. Applicability.
§ 62-29. General findings regarding retail license distribution.
Wall Township has determined that geographical location is a critical factor
in the distribution of any new licenses and the redistribution of existing
licenses for the following reasons:
§ 62-30. Retail license distribution goals.
It is hereby determined that it would be in the best interests of the Township
of Wall and its citizens to pursue the following goals in the geographic
distribution of retail alcoholic beverage licenses in the Township:
A. This policy document pertains to two types of liquor licenses that Wall
Township currently controls: Plenary retail consumption licenses and
plenary retail distribution licenses. Consumption licenses are utilized
by bars and restaurants while distribution licenses are utilized by liquor
stores in the retail sale of liquor where liquor is not consumed on-site.
B. Wall Township currently controls 12 plenary retail consumption
licenses and one plenary retail distribution license.
A. Liquor licenses can be used as an incentive to the redevelopment of
commercial areas in need thereof.
B. Liquor licenses should be distributed geographically in a manner that
provides opportunity for commercial zones throughout the Township
and the population that they serve.
C. A concentration of consumption licenses in any one part of the
Township may be undesirable to adjacent neighborhoods, particularly if
they are granted to bars or taverns that typically operate until 2:00 a.m.
A. Foster and maintain a geographical distribution of consumption and
distribution licenses so as to provide opportunities to underserved
areas and areas of future growth.
B. Utilize retail liquor licenses where appropriate to encourage
redevelopment of commercial areas.
C. Consider the potential negative impacts of concentrating retail liquor
licenses into a limited geographical area before permitting new licenses
within already-served areas.
§ 62-28 ALARMS § 62-31
59:169
§ 62-31. Retail license distribution priorities.
The distribution of retail licenses, particularly plenary retail consumption
licenses, will be prioritized in a manner that will meet the goals of the
Township as set forth herein. Only in extraordinary cases, where the
interests of the Township are advanced in a manner not contemplated
herein, will licenses be distributed contrary to the following:
A. Highest priority areas:
(1) Route 71 Redevelopment Area: The Township should use the
distribution of any new or existing liquor licenses as an incentive
for redevelopers in the Route 71 Redevelopment Area to create a
family-style restaurant.
(2) Monmouth Executive Airport and area immediately surrounding:
The creation of an upscale restaurant at the Monmouth Executive
Airport or its immediate vicinity is also found to be desirable.
(3) Route 34 Corridor: Restaurants in the corridor are desired to
provide services to existing and proposed corporate offices in the
corridor.
B. Lowest priority areas:
(1) Route 35 corridor, south of Allaire Road; and
(2) Route 35 corridor, north of Allaire Road. Properties in the Route 35
corridor already hold a majority of the existing retail liquor licenses
in the Township, particularly Route 35 south of Allaire Road. It is
the Township's intention to limit the distribution of additional
licenses to this area, and to Route 35 in general, in order to provide
opportunities elsewhere in the Township.
(3) Private membership clubs. The Township also places a lower
priority on granting licenses to private membership clubs that are
not open to the general public.

FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
GENERAL REFERENCES
Uniform construction codes  See Ch. 90.
Stormwater management  See Ch. 140, Art.
XXXIII.
Water and sewers  See Ch. 222.
§ 116-1. Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and
objectives.
A. Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has
in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et seq., delegated the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote public
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the
Township Committee of the Township of Wall, of New Jersey does ordain
as follows:
B. Findings of fact:
(1) The flood hazard areas of the Township of Wall are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
service, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and
relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect
the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(2) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood
heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, causes
damage in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed,
elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute
to the flood loss.
C. Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed to:
(1) Protect human life and health;
(2) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
(3) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general
public;
§ 113-8 FIRE INSURANCE CLAIMS § 116-1
110:219
§ 116-2. Word usage; definitions.
(4) Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
(6) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize
future flood blight areas;
(7) Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area
of special flood hazard; and
(8) Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
D. Methods of reducing flood losses: In order to accomplish its purposes,
this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
(1) Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which
result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or
velocities;
(2) Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;
(3) Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or
channel floodwaters;
(4) Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development
which may increase flood damage; and
(5) Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood
hazards in other areas.

§ 116-12 WALL CODE § 116-12
110:228
§ 116-13. Conditions for variances.
§ 116-14. General standards for flood hazard reduction.
In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required:
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further
the purposes of this chapter.
F. The Construction Official shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions, including technical information, and report any variances to
the Federal Insurance Administration upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, provided that § 116-12D(1)
through (11) has been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond
the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as
an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
C. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
D. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public as identified in § 116-12D, or conflict
with existing local laws or ordinances.
F. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
A. Anchoring.
§ 116-12 FIRE INSURANCE CLAIMS § 116-14
110:229
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the
structure.
(2) All manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include,
but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground
anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and
local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
B. Construction materials and methods.
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood
damage.
(2) All new construction and substantial improvement shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood
damage.
C. Utilities.
(1) All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
(2) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems
and discharge from the systems into floodwaters;
(3) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding;
and
(4) Electrical heating, ventilation, plumbing and air-conditioning
equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components during conditions of flooding.
D. Subdivision proposals.
(1) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
(2) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage;
(3) All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood damage; and
(4) Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development which contain at least
50 lots or five acres (whichever is less).
§ 116-14 WALL CODE § 116-14
110:230
§ 116-15. Specific standards.
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data have
been provided as set forth in § 116-4 or in § 116-11B, the following
standards are required:
E. Enclosure openings. All new construction and substantial
improvements having fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that
are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in
an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall
be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs
for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria: A minimum of two openings having a total net area of
not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall
be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped
with screens, louvers, or other covering or devices, provided that they
permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
A. Residential construction.
(1) New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall have the lowest structural member of the lowest
floor, including basement together with the attendant utilities and
sanitary facilities, elevated to or above base flood elevation.
(2) Require within any AO zone on the municipality's FIRM that all new
construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated
above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth
number specified in feet (at least two feet if no depth number is
specified), and require adequate drainage paths around structures
on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
B. Nonresidential construction.
(1) New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either:
(a) Have the lowest floor, including basement together with the
attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, elevated to the level
of the base flood elevation; and
(b) Require within any AO zone on the municipality's FIRM that all
new construction and substantial improvement of any
commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall
either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated
above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth
number specified in feet (at least two feet if no depth number is
§ 116-14 FIRE INSURANCE CLAIMS § 116-15
110:231
§ 116-16. Floodway.
specified), and require adequate drainage paths around
structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away
from proposed structures;
(2) Or together with the attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, shall:
(a) Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure
is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water;
(b) Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
(c) Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance
with accepted standards of practice for meeting the applicable
provisions of this subsection. Such certification shall be
provided to the official as set forth in § 116-11C(2).
C. Manufactured homes.
(1) Manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance with
§ 116-14A(2).
(2) All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved
within an area of special flood hazard shall be elevated on a
permanent foundation, such that the top of the lowest floor is at or
above the base flood elevation.
A. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in § 116-4 are
areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions
apply:
(1) Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development unless a
technical evaluation demonstrates that encroachments shall not
result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge.
(2) If § 116-16A(1) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of §§ 116-14 through 116-16.
(3) In all areas of special flood hazard in which base flood elevation
data has been provided and no floodway has been designated, the
cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than
0.2 of a foot at any point.

indirectly, by legal action instituted by any state agency, political
subdivision or other party to protect the public health and welfare or by
a directive or order issued by any state agency, political subdivision or
court of competent jurisdiction to protect the public health and welfare,
the municipal agency shall process such application for development

this chapter, the municipal agency shall approve such application
conditioned on removal of such legal barrier to development.

the municipal agency, the municipal agency shall, in appropriate
instances, condition its approval upon the subsequent approval of such
governmental agency, provided that the municipal agency shall make a
decision on any application for development within the time period

period.
D. The municipal agency may impose such other conditions as it deems
appropriate.
E. In all cases the municipal agency shall include a condition of approval
setting forth the time within which all conditions of approval must be
satisfied by the applicant. Failure of the applicant to meet all conditions
of approval within the time specified or within such extensions thereof
as the municipal agency may, from time to time, grant upon the request
of the applicant shall render any approvals null and void.
F. Tolling of running of period of approval. In the event that, during the
period of approval heretofore or hereafter granted to an application for
development, the developer is barred or prevented, directly or
indirectly, from proceeding with the development otherwise permitted
under such approval by a legal action instituted by any state agency,
political subdivision or other party to protect the public health and
welfare or by a directive or order issued by any state agency, political
subdivision or court of competent jurisdiction to protect the public
health or welfare and the developer is otherwise ready, willing and able
to proceed with said development, the running of the period of approval
shall be suspended for the period of time said legal action is pending or
such directive or order is in effect.
§ 140-50 WALL CODE § 140-51

Every application for development submitted to the Planning Board or to
the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall be accompanied by proof that no
taxes or assessments for local improvements are due or delinquent on the
property which is the subject of such application; and if it is shown that
taxes or assessments are delinquent on said property, any approvals or
other relief granted by either board shall be conditioned upon the payment
of such taxes and/or assessments.
§ 140-52. Referral of certain matters to Environmental Advisory
Committee.19
The Land Use Office shall forward an informational copy of all major
subdivision, major site plan and use variance applications to the
Environmental Advisory Committee. The Environmental Advisory
Committee may provide a report and recommendations to the Planning
Board or Board of Adjustment concerning any such application. A report
or recommendation of the Environmental Advisory Committee shall not be
binding upon the board, but shall be advisory in nature. The failure of
the Environmental Advisory Committee to receive an informational copy
of an application or of the approving board to receive a report from the
Environmental Advisory Committee shall not preclude the board from
hearing an application nor shall it invalidate any hearing or proceeding.

work to continue on the development or the application, the
applicant shall, within a twenty-one-day period from date of
notification period post a deposit to the account in an amount to be
agreed upon by the Township and the applicant. In the interim, any
required health and safety inspections shall be made and charged

(3) Deposits received from any developer pursuant to this section shall
be deposited in a banking institution or savings and loan
association in this state insured by an agency of the federal
government, or in any other fund or depository approved for such
deposits by the state, in an account bearing interest at the

time or saving deposits. The Township shall notify the applicant in
writing of the name and address of the institution or depository in
§ 140-59 WALL CODE § 140-59
139:318
which the deposit is made and the amount of the deposit. The
Township shall not be required to refund an amount of interest paid
on a deposit which does not exceed $100 for the year. If the amount
of interest exceeds $100, that entire amount shall belong to the
developer and shall be refunded to him by the Township annually
or at the time the deposit is repaid or applied to the purposes
for which it was deposited, as the case may be; except that the
Township may retain for administrative expenses a sum equivalent
to not more than 33 1/3% of that entire amount, which shall be in
lieu of all other administrative and custodial expenses pertaining to
the escrow account.
(4) The Chief Financial Office of the Township shall make all of the
payments to professionals for services rendered to the Township
for review of applications for development, review and preparation
of documents, inspection of improvements or other purposes under
the provisions of the Municipal Land Use Law, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et
seq. Such fees or charges shall be based upon a schedule
established by resolution or resolutions as adopted by the Township

requirements of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.1.

professionals and Township employed professionals for services
involved in processing an application which requires escrow
account deposits shall be charged against the escrow account.
(7) The Chief Financial Officer shall prepare and send to the applicant
a statement which shall include an accounting of funds listing all
deposits, interest earnings, disbursements, and the cumulative
balance of the escrow account. This information shall be provided
on a quarterly basis, if monthly charges are $1,000 or less, or on a
monthly basis, if monthly charges exceed $1,000.
(8) Each payment charged to the deposit for review of the application,
review and preparation of documents and inspection of
improvements shall be pursuant to a voucher from the professional.
Said voucher shall identify the personnel performing the service,
the date, the services performed, the hours spent to one-quarterhour
increments, the hourly rate and the expenses incurred. All
professionals shall submit vouchers to the Chief Financial Officer of
the Township on a monthly basis in accordance with schedules and
procedure established by the Chief Financial Officer of the
Township. If the services are provided by a Township employee, the
employee shall prepare and submit to the Chief Financial Officer a
statement containing the same information as required on the
voucher, on a monthly basis. The professional shall send an
informational copy of all vouchers or statements submitted to the
§ 140-59 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-59
139:319
Chief Financial Officer of the Township simultaneously to the
applicant.
(9) The application review and inspection charges shall be limited only
to professional charges for review of applications, review and
preparation of documents and inspections of developments under
construction and review by outside consultants when an
application is of a nature beyond the scope of the expertise of the
professionals normally utilized by the Township.
(10) The only costs that shall be added to any such charges shall be
actual out-of-pocket expenses of any such professional or
consultants including normal and typical expenses incurred in
processing applications and inspecting improvements. The
Township shall not bill the applicant, or charge an escrow account
or deposit, for any Township clerical or administrative functions,
overhead expenses, meeting room charges, or any other costs and
expenses, except as provided for in this section, nor shall a
Township professional add any such charges to his bill.
(11) A professional shall not review items which are subject to approval
by any state agency and not under municipal jurisdiction except to
the extent that consultation with a state agency is necessary due to
the effect of state approval of the subdivision or site plan.
(12) All professional charges for review of an application for
development, review and preparation of documents, or inspection
of improvements shall be reasonable and necessary, given the
status and progress of the application or construction. Review fees
shall be charged only in connection with an application for
development presently pending before the approving authority or
upon review of compliance with conditions of approval, or review of
requests for modifications or amendment made by the applicant.
(13) If the Township retains a different professional or consultant in the
place of the professional originally responsible for development
application review or inspection of improvements, the Township
shall be responsible for all time and expenses of the new
professional to become familiar with the application or project and
shall not bill the applicant or charge the deposit or the escrow
account for any such services.
(14) If the salary, staff support and overhead for a Township
professional are provided by the municipality, the charge shall not
exceed 200% of the sum of the product resulting from multiplying
the hourly base salary of the professional by the number of hours
spent by the respective professional upon review of the application
for development or inspection of the developer's improvements, as
the case may be. For other professionals the charge shall be at the
same rate as all other work of the same nature by the professional
§ 140-59 WALL CODE § 140-59
139:320
for the municipality when fees are not reimbursed or otherwise
imposed on applicants or developers.
D. Inspection fees.
(1) Inspection fees shall be charged only for actual work shown on a
subdivision or site plan required by the Township. Professionals
inspecting improvements under construction shall charge only for
inspections that are reasonably necessary to check the progress
and quality of the work and such inspections shall be reasonably
based on the approved development plans and documents.
(2) The developer shall be required to deposit funds into an escrow
account for the inspection fees pursuant to § 140-60.
(3) The amount of monies to be deposited with the Township shall be as
set forth in § 140-60 of this chapter.
E. Refund of monies in escrow account. The following close out and refund
procedure shall apply to all deposits and escrow accounts established
under the provisions of the Municipal Land Use Law, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1
et seq., and shall commence after the Township has granted final
approval and signed the subdivision plat or site plan, in the case of
application review escrows and deposits, or after the improvements
have been finally approved, in the case of improvement inspection
escrows and deposits and the Township has further determined that
there is no longer any need to retain any escrow account:
(1) The applicant shall send written notice by certified mail to the
Chief Financial Officer and to the relevant Township professional,
that the application or the improvements are completed.
(2) After receipt of such notice, the professional shall render a final bill
to the Chief Financial Officer within 30 days and shall send a copy
simultaneously to the applicant.
(3) The Chief Financial Officer shall render a written final accounting
to the applicant on the uses to which the escrow account deposit
was put within 45 days after the receipt of the final bill.
(4) Any balances remaining in the deposit or escrow account, including
interest in accordance with the requirements of N.J.S.A.
40:55D-53.1 shall be refunded to the developer along with the final
accounting.
(5) In the event that an applicant requests a refund of any balances
remaining in a deposit or escrow account and it is necessary for the
Township to provide additional professional services or inspection
services relating to that development application, it will be
necessary for developer to post a new deposit or escrow amount
pursuant to this section as if it were a new development
application.
§ 140-59 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-59
139:321
§ 140-60. Inspection fees.
F. Dispute of charges.
(1) An applicant shall notify in writing the Township Committee with
copies to the Chief Financial Officer, the approving authority and
the professional whenever the applicant disputes the charges made
by a professional for services rendered to the Township in
reviewing applications for development, review and preparation of
documents, inspection of improvements, or other charges made
pursuant to the provisions of P.L. 1975, c. 291 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et
seq.).
(2) The Township Committee or its designee shall, within a twenty-oneday
period attempt to remediate any disputed charges. In the event
that the matter is not resolved to the satisfaction of the applicant,
the applicant may appeal, in writing, to the County Construction
Board of Appeals established under Section 9 of P.L. 1975, c. 217
(N.J.S.A. 52:27D-127).
(3) An applicant filing an appeal shall simultaneously send a copy to
the Township, the approving agency, and any professional whose
charge is the subject of the appeal.
(4) Any appeal shall be filed within 45 days from receipt of the
informational copy of the professional's voucher, except that if the
professional has not supplied the applicant with the informational
copy of the voucher, then the applicant shall file his appeal within
60 days from receipt of the municipal statement of activity against
the deposit or escrow account.
A. The developer shall reimburse the Township for all reasonable
inspection fees paid to the Township Engineer for the inspection of
improvements, provided that the Township shall require of the
developer a deposit for the inspection fees in an amount not to exceed,
except for extraordinary circumstances, the greater of $500 or 5% of
the cost of improvements. For those developments for which the
reasonably anticipated fees are less than $10,000, fees may, at the
option of the developer, be paid in two installments. The initial amount
deposited by a developer shall be 50% of the reasonably anticipated
fees. When the balance on deposit drops to 10% of the reasonably
anticipated fees because the amount deposited by the developer has
been reduced by the amount paid to the Township Engineer for
inspection, the developer shall deposit the remaining 50% of the
anticipated inspection fees. For those developments for which the
reasonably anticipated fees are $10,000 or greater, fees may, at the
option of the developer, be paid in four installments. The initial amount
deposited by a developer shall be 25% of the reasonably anticipated
fees. When the balance on deposit drops to 10% of the reasonably
anticipated fees because the amount deposited by the developer has
been reduced by the amount paid to the Township Engineer for
§ 140-59 WALL CODE § 140-60
139:322
inspection, the developer shall make additional deposits of 25% of the
reasonably anticipated fees. The Township Engineer shall not perform
any inspection if sufficient funds to pay for those inspections are not on
deposit.
B. When notified of an account deficiency, the developer shall, within five
business days, reimburse the Township and deposit funds sufficient to
cover future reasonably anticipated inspection expenses. Failure to
accomplish reimbursement and a future deposit against expenses shall
cause the cessation of inspection by the Township Engineer and of the
issuance of permits and certificates by the Land Use Office.

as may be consented to by the applicant shall constitute a decision
favorable to the applicant.
E. Any variance permitting use or structure in a district in which such use
or structure is not permitted shall expire by limitations three years after
the date of the decision granting the variance, unless the construction
of the structure or the use has been commenced within that period of
time. The running of the aforesaid period of limitation shall be
suspended from the date of filing of an appeal from the decision to a
court of competent jurisdiction until the termination of such appeal.

failure of the Planning Board or Committee to act shall be issued on
request of the applicant.
E. Except as provided in Subsection G below, approval of a minor
subdivision shall expire 190 days from the date on which the resolution

that the approved minor subdivision shall have been duly recorded as
provided in this section.
G. The Planning Board may extend the one-hundred-ninety-day period for
filing a minor subdivision plat or deed pursuant to Subsection E above if
the developer proves to the reasonable satisfaction of the approving
board that the developer was barred or prevented, directly or indirectly,
from filing because of delays in obtaining legally required approvals
from other governmental or quasi-governmental entities and that the
developer applied promptly for and diligently pursued the required
approvals. The length of the extension shall be equal to the period of
delay caused by the wait for the required approvals, as determined by
the board. The developer may apply for an extension either before or
after what would otherwise be the expiration date.

development application and all applicable fees shall be submitted to
the Land Use Officer pursuant to this chapter. The application shall be
declared complete or incomplete within a forty-five-day period from the
date of submission pursuant to this chapter. If determined to be

shall be acted upon within 45 days of the date of such submission,
or 120 days if a variance is required, or within such further time as
may be consented to by the developer. A subdivision of more than

more than 10 dwelling units, shall be acted upon within 95 days of
the date of such submissions, or 120 days if a variance is required,
or within such further time as may be consented to by the

(5) Effect of preliminary approval of major subdivisions and major site
plans.
(a) Preliminary approval of a major subdivision and site plan shall,
except as provided in Subsection A(5)(b) of this section, confer
upon the applicant the following rights for a three year period
from the date on which the resolution of preliminary approval
is adopted:
[1] That the general terms and conditions on which
preliminary approval was granted shall not be changed,
including, but not limited to, use requirements; layout and
design standards for streets, curbs and sidewalks; lot
sizes; yard dimensions and off-tract improvements; and in
the case of a site plan, any requirements peculiar to site
plan approval pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-41, except that
nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the Township
from modifying by ordinance such general terms and
conditions of preliminary approval as relate to public
health and safety;
[2] That the applicant may submit for final approval on or
before the expiration date of preliminary approval the
whole or a section or sections of the preliminary
subdivision plat or site plan, as the case may be; and
[3] That the applicant may apply for and the Planning Board
may grant extensions on such preliminary approval for
additional periods of at least one year but not to exceed a
total extension of two years, provided that if the design
and improvement standards have been revised by
ordinance, such revised standards may govern.
§ 140-80 WALL CODE § 140-80
139:344
(b) In the case of a subdivision of or site plan for an area of 50
acres or more, the board may rant the rights referred to in
Subsection A(5)(a)[1], [2] and [3] above for such period of time,
longer than three years, as shall be determined by the board to
be reasonable taking into consideration the number of dwelling
units and nonresidential floor area permissible under
preliminary approval, economic conditions, and the
comprehensiveness of the development. The applicant may
apply for thereafter and the board may thereafter grant an
extension to preliminary approval for such additional period of
time as shall be determined by the board to be reasonable
taking into consideration the number of dwelling units and
nonresidential floor area permissible under preliminary
approval, the potential number of dwelling units and
nonresidential floor area of the section or sections awaiting
final approval, economic conditions, and the
comprehensiveness of the development, provided that if the
design and improvement standards have been revised, such
revised standards may govern.
(c) Whenever the board grants an extension of preliminary
approval pursuant to Subsection A(5)(a)[3] or A(5)(b) of this
section and preliminary approval has expired before the date
on which the extension is granted, the extension shall begin on
what would otherwise be the expiration date. The developer
may apply for the extension either before or after what would
otherwise be the expiration date.
(d) The board shall grant an extension of preliminary approval for
a period determined by the board but not exceeding one year
from what would otherwise be the expiration date, if the
developer proves to the reasonable satisfaction of the board
that the developer was barred or prevented, directly or
indirectly, from proceeding with the development because of
delays in obtaining legally required approvals from other
governmental entities and that the developer applied promptly
for and diligently pursued the required approvals. A developer
shall apply for the extension before what would otherwise be
the expiration date of the preliminary approval or the 91st day
after the developer receives the last legally required approval
from other governmental entities, whichever occurs later. An
extension granted pursuant to this subsection shall not
preclude the board from granting an extension pursuant to
Subsection A(5)(a)[3] or A(5)(b) of this section.
(e) Where a developer plans to install the site improvements prior
to final approval, the developer shall submit the engineering
plans and specifications for the improvements and the required
fees and insurance certificate to the Township Engineer, who
shall act upon them within 35 days. In the event of a denial, the
§ 140-80 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-80
139:345
specific reasons must be enumerated in letter to the applicant.
If revised plans are submitted in response to the denial letter,
they shall be approved or denied within 20 days with the
same requirements as previously imposed for a denial. After
the plans are approved, the developer may install the site
improvements prior to final approval. Prior to such installation,
the developer shall either post a performance guarantee
pursuant to this chapter or shall be required to furnish a
restoration guarantee for 120% of the maximum cost of
restoring the site in the event that the improvements are not
complete within two years from the commencement of the
work on any section in the development or prior to the
expiration of preliminary approval, which ever occurs first. The
guarantee shall either be a surety bond, a letter of credit, or
cash.
B. Final approval.
(1) An applicant requesting final approval of a proposed major
subdivision or site plan shall submit to the Land Use Officer of the
Planning Board, or other designee, 18 copies of the materials
specified in this chapter. Unless the preliminary plat was approved
without changes, the final plat shall have incorporated all changes
or modifications required by the Planning Board. The final plat or
map shall also be accompanied by a statement from the Township
Engineer that the Township is in receipt of as-built plans showing
all streets and utilities in exact location and elevation and
identifying those portions already installed and those to be
installed, and that the developer has complied with one or both of
the following:
(a) Installed all improvements in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter; or
(b) A performance guarantee has been posted with the Township
pursuant to Article XV.
(2) The application for final subdivision or site plan approval shall be
declared complete within a forty-five-day period from the date of its
submission according to the provisions of this chapter.
(3) Final approval shall be granted or denied within 45 days after
submission of a complete application to the Land Use Officer, or
within such further time as may be consented to by the applicant.
Failure of the Planning Board to act within the period prescribed
shall constitute final approval.
(4) Final approval of a major subdivision shall expire 95 days from the
date of signing of the plat by the Chairman and Secretary of the
Planning Board unless within such period the plat shall have been
duly filed by the developer with the county recording officer. The
board may, for good cause shown, extend the period for recording
§ 140-80 WALL CODE § 140-80
139:346
for an additional period not to exceed 190 days from the date of
signing of the plat. The Planning Board may extend the ninety-fiveday
or one-hundred-ninety-day period if the developer proves to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Planning Board that the developer
was barred or prevented, directly or indirectly, from filing because
of delays in obtaining legally required approvals from other
governmental or quasi-governmental entities and that the
developer applied promptly for and diligently pursued the required
approvals. The length of the extension shall be equal to the period
of delay caused by the wait for the required approvals, as
determined by the board. The developer may apply for an extension
either before or after the original expiration date.
(5) No subdivision plat or deed shall be filed unless it has been duly
approved by the board as indicated by the signature of the
Chairman and Secretary of the board. The signatures of the
Chairman and Secretary of the board shall not be affixed until the
developer has posted the guarantees required pursuant to this
chapter.
(6) Developers agreement. Prior to the signing and recording of final
major subdivision plats and as a condition of final site plan approval
in the case of a site plan, the developer shall enter into an
agreement with the governing body. This agreement shall be of a
form that is acceptable to the Township Attorney and one in which
the developer agrees to abide by the terms and conditions of the
board approval, construct the required improvements in
accordance with the approved plans, agree to maintain the
constructed improvements including but not limited to, payment of
streetlighting charges, snow removal, maintenance of storm
drainage, sewer and water facilities. The developer also shall agree
that in the event the improvements are not maintained, the
Township can utilize the cash portions of the performance
guarantees to immediately attend to such items.
(7) Submission of part of subdivision for final approval.
(a) In the case of large subdivisions, where economic conditions,
special circumstances or other applicable reasons exist,
whereby it is unfeasible, impractical, or would create undue
hardship upon a subdivider to comply with the requirements of
the preceding § 140-39, the Planning Board shall accept and
approve applications for final approval which otherwise meet
the requirements of § 140-80B(1) to (6) for part or parts of a
subdivision, provided that all of the following conditions are
also met:
[1] The number of lots on the approved preliminary plat shall
be more than 30.
§ 140-80 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-80
139:347
[2] The number of lots on any final plat submitted under this
subsection shall not be less than 10 on the first section
submitted for final approval and not less than 20 on all
subsequent sections submitted for final approval.
[3] Not more than 50% of the lots on the preliminary plat front
on an existing street.
[4] All of the improvements and utilities required whether
they be on-site, off-site or off-tract, to provide permanent
access and necessary services to the lots shown on the
final map have been completed.
[5] In the event the preliminary plat has been approved
pursuant to zone modification provisions of the applicable
ordinance and improvements to or dedication of lands for
public use have been approved, a portion of the required
improvements and the transfer of ownership to the
Township of the lands shall have been made in the same
proportion as the number of lots on the final map is to the
number of lots on the approved preliminary plat.
[6] The applicant provides temporary or permanent
easements, rights-of-way or other appropriate instruments
to the Township for all access, utility lines, storm drainage
facilities, watercourses or other facilities crossing, or in
any way affecting lands remaining in the applicant's
ownership or other privately owned lands that are
required for the independent functioning of the portion of
the subdivision for which final approval is being sought.
[7] The filing fee to be paid by the applicant for each final map
submitted shall be $500 dollars plus $10 per lot shown on
the final map.
(b) Temporary culs-de-sac shall be completed and maintained by
the subdivider where a cul-de-sac would otherwise be required
on any proposed street that will be temporarily terminated
until such street has been extended, improved and accepted to
either another temporary or permanent cul-de-sac, its
intersection or connection to another improved street
connecting to an existing public street, or a public street. The
excess right-of-way in the temporary cul-de-sac shall revert to
the adjoining lots and until such street shall have been
extended, improved and accepted no building shall be erected
on any lot affected by such excess right-of-way for a temporary
cul-de-sac. The construction of temporary culs-de-sac pursuant
to this subsection shall be in accordance with the specifications
set forth in this chapter.
(8) Effect of final approval of major subdivisions and major site plans.
The zoning requirements applicable to the preliminary approval
§ 140-80 WALL CODE § 140-80
139:348
first granted and all other rights conferred upon the developer
pursuant to this article whether conditionally or otherwise shall not
be changed for a period of two years after the date on which the
resolution of final approval is adopted, provided that in the case of
major subdivision the rights conferred by this section shall expire if
the plat has not been duly recorded within the time period provided
in § 140-80B(4).
(a) If the developer has followed the standards prescribed for final
approval and, in the case of a subdivision has duly recorded the
plat, the Planning Board may extend such period of protection
for extensions of one year, but not to exceed three extensions.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, the
granting of final approval terminates the time period of
preliminary approval pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-49 and
§ 140-80A(5) above, for the section granted final approval.
(b) In the case of a subdivision or site plan for a planned
development of 50 acres or more, conventional subdivision or
site plan for 150 acres or more, or site plan for development of
a nonresidential floor area of 200,000 square feet or more, the
Planning Board may grant the rights referred to in Subsection
B(8)(a) above for such period of time, longer than two years, as
shall be determined by the Planning Board to be reasonable
taking into consideration the number of dwelling units and
nonresidential floor area permissible under final approval,
economic conditions, and the comprehensiveness of the
development. The developer may apply for thereafter, the
Planning Board may thereafter grant, an extension of final
approval for such additional period of time as shall be
determined by the Planning Board to be reasonable taking into
consideration the number of dwelling units and nonresidential
floor area permissible under final approval, the number of
dwelling units and nonresidential floor area remaining to be
developed, economic conditions, and the comprehensiveness
of the development.
(c) Whenever the board grants an extension of final approval
pursuant to Subsection A(8)(A) and (b) of this section and final
approval has expired before the date on which the extension is
granted, the extension shall begin on what would otherwise be
the expiration date. The developer may apply for the extension
either before or after what would otherwise be the expiration
date.
(d) The Planning Board shall grant an extension of final approval
for a period determined by the board but not exceeding one
year from what would otherwise be the expiration date, if the
developer proves to the reasonable satisfaction of the board
that the developer was barred or prevented, directly or
indirectly, from proceeding with the development because of
§ 140-80 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-80
139:349
§ 140-81. Technical subdivisions. [Added 9-9-1998 by Ord. No.
20-1998]
delays in obtaining legally required approvals from other
governmental entities and that the developer applied promptly
for and diligently pursued these approvals. A developer shall
apply for the extension before what would otherwise be the
expiration date of the final approval or the 91st day after
the developer receives the last legally required approval from
other governmental entities, whichever occurs later. An
extension granted pursuant to this subsection shall not
preclude the Planning Board from granting an extension
pursuant to Subsection B(8)(a) and (b) section.
A. While subdivisions are not usually required for nonresidential
development, it is recognized that a commercial project to be developed
pursuant to this chapter may be of such a size or type so as to make
sectionalization by subdivision and the use of different forms of
ownership a practical necessity. The Township recognizes that a
technical subdivision for such a project may be required for marketing
or financing purposes.
B. An application for technical subdivision approval may be submitted
with an application for approval of a nonresidential site plan, or
subsequent to the issuance of such an approval.
C. An application for technical subdivision approval may be submitted
with an application for approval of a site plan for a residential
development providing for low- and/or moderate-income housing units
as part of the Township's affordable housing plan, or subsequent to the
issuance of such an approval.
D. Such an application shall be considered as a technical subdivision and
treated as a minor subdivision application without the necessity to
obtain bulk variances that would technically be required, subject to the
following conditions:
(1) The purpose of the application is to create a new lot for the purpose
of financing or transfer of ownership within a development which
is, or has been, the subject of site plan approval.
(2) A technical subdivision may not substantially modify or otherwise
adversely impact on the integrity of a previously approved
development plan.
(3) A technical subdivision must not reduce, limit or modify parking or
access to parking.
(4) If a technical subdivision includes the division of parking or other
common areas or facilities, the subdivision shall be conditioned
upon appropriate easements for parking, access, drainage and/or
utilities where necessary.

application until such time as the approved minor subdivision or final
subdivision plat is filed with the County Clerk.

Detention Facilities
§ 140-83. Responsibility for operation and maintenance.24
§ 140-84. Dedication of facilities.
Where required, the stormwater management facilities shall be dedicated
to the Township of Wall as a drainage utility easement or right-of-way.
Detention or retention facility dedication shall be 15 feet from the top
of bank of facilities in cut and the toe of slope of facilities constructed
in fill. Inlet and outlet piping and maintenance access shall be contained
within thirty-foot wide, minimum, drainage utility easements. No relocation,
construction or reconstruction shall take place within the area of the
easement, nor shall any structures be located within such area, nor shall
any action be taken which may alter or impair the effectiveness of present
or future drainage facilities or cause soil erosion without prior approving
authority or Township Committee approval.
A. Responsibility for operation and maintenance of detention facilities,
including periodic removal and disposal of accumulated particulate
material and debris, shall remain with the owner or owners of the
property or a homeowners' association with permanent arrangements
that it shall pass to any successive owner, unless assumed by a
governmental agency. If portions of the land are to be sold, legally
binding arrangements shall be made to pass the basic responsibility to
successors in title. These arrangements shall designate for each project
the property owner, governmental agency, or other legally established
entity to be permanently responsible for maintenance, hereinafter in
this section referred to as the responsible person.
B. Prior to granting approval to any project subject to review under this
chapter, the applicant shall enter into an agreement with the
municipality to ensure the continued operation and maintenance of the
detention facility. This agreement shall be in a form satisfactory to the
Township Attorney and may include, but may not necessarily be limited
to, personal guarantees, deed restrictions, covenants, and bonds.
C. An applicant seeking approval for construction of a stormwater
management facility shall provide the funds necessary to permanently
maintain the facility. The amount necessary to permanently maintain
the facility shall be calculated by the Planning Board Engineer based
upon current estimates for maintenance with an annual increase of 4%.
The Planning Board Engineer shall also assume that the investment will
yield a return equal to the ninety-day certificate of deposit interest rate
paid by the First Fidelity Bank or its successor on the date the
calculation is made.

ARTICLE XIV
Off-Tract Improvements
§ 140-85. Purpose.
This article is intended to ensure a pro rata share allocation of the costs for
off-tract improvements necessitated by new development.
§ 140-86. Definition and principles.
As a condition of final subdivision or site plan approval, the municipal
agency may require an applicant to pay his/her pro rata share of the cost of
providing reasonable and necessary circulation improvements and drainage
facilities, including land and easements, located off-tract of the property
limits of the subdivision or development but necessitated or required by
the development. "Necessary" improvements are those clearly, directly,
and substantially related to the development in question. The board shall
provide in its resolution of approval the basis of the required improvements.
The improvements cost shall include all design, legal, and other related
expenses. The proportionate or pro rata amount of the cost of such facilities
within a related or common area shall be based on the following criteria.
§ 140-87. Cost allocation.
§ 140-88. Agreement for different allocation method authorized.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent the municipal
agency and the developer from agreeing to use a different method to
allocate cost.
§ 140-89. Applicant's proportionate share of street improvements.
The applicant's proportionate share of street improvements, alignment,
channelization, barriers, new or improved traffic signalization, signs, curbs,
sidewalks, trees, utility improvements uncovered elsewhere, the
A. Full allocation. In cases where off-tract improvements are necessitated
by the proposed development, and where no other property owner(s)
receive(s) a special benefit thereby, or where neither the Township nor
any other government entity has planned or accepted the responsibility
for any portion of the cost of the improvement, the applicant may be
required at his sole expense and as a condition of approval, to provide
and install such improvements.
B. Proportionate allocation. Where it is determined that the properties
outside the development will also be benefited by the off-tract
improvement, or where neither the Township nor any other government
entity has planned or accepted the responsibility for any portion of the
cost of the improvement, the following criteria shall be utilized in
determining the proportionate share of the cost of such improvements
to the developer.
§ 140-85 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-89
139:355
construction or reconstruction of new or existing streets, and other
associated street or traffic improvements shall be as follows:
§ 140-90. Applicant's proportionate share of drainage
improvements.
The applicant's proportionate share of stormwater and drainage
improvements including the installation, relocation and replacement of
storm drains, culverts, catch basins, manholes, riprap, improved drainage
ditches and appurtenances thereto, and relocation or replacement of other
storm drainage facilities or appurtenances associated therewith, shall be
determined as follows:
A. The Township Engineer or Planner shall provide the applicant with the
existing and reasonably anticipated future peak hour flows for the offtract
improvements.
B. The applicant shall furnish a plan for the proposed off-tract
improvement which shall include the estimated peak-hour traffic
generated by the proposed development and the proportion thereof
which is to be accommodated by the proposed off-tract improvement.
The ratio of the peak-hour traffic generated by the proposed
development which is to be accommodated by the off-tract
improvement to the future additional peak-hour anticipated to impact
the proposed off-tract improvement shall form the basis of the
proportionate share.
A. The capacity and the design of the drainage system to accommodate
stormwater runoff shall be based on the standards specified in this
chapter, computed by the developer's engineer and approved by the
Township Engineer.
B. The capacity of the enlarged, extended, or improved system required
for the subdivision and areas outside of the developer's tributary to the
drainage system shall be determined by the developer's engineer
subject to approval of the Township Engineer. The plans for the
improved system shall be prepared by the developer's engineer and the
estimated cost of the enlarged system calculated by the Township
Engineer.

Improvement, Performance and Maintenance Guarantees
§ 140-91. Purpose of improvement guarantees.
Improvement guarantees shall be provided to ensure the municipality of the
proper installation and maintenance of on-site and on-tract improvements.
§ 140-92. Performance guarantees.
A. Prior to the approval of a final site plan requiring public improvements
to be owned by or dedicated to the Township, a developer shall be
required to post a performance guarantee in conformance with this
article.
B. Before the recording of final subdivision plats or as a condition of final
site plan approval or as a condition to the issuance of a zoning permit
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-65, the board shall require and the
Township shall accept in accordance with the standards set forth
herein, for the purpose of assuring the installation and maintenance of
on-tract improvements, a performance guarantee in favor of the
Township, as follows: [Amended 8-28-2019 by Ord. No. 10-2019]
(1) The developer shall furnish a performance guarantee in favor of the
Township that shall be in an amount of 120% of the cost of
installation, which cost shall be determined by the Township
Engineer for only those improvements required by an approval or
developer's agreement, ordinance or regulation to be dedicated to
a public entity, including streets, curbs, grading, pavement,
gutters, sidewalks, streetlighting, street trees, surveyor's
monuments, as shown on the final plat and required by the Map
Filing Law (N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq.), water mains, sanitary
sewers, community septic system, drainage structures, public
improvements of open space and any grading necessitated by the
preceding improvements. A performance guarantee shall also be
furnished for privately owned perimeter buffer landscaping as
required by local ordinance or imposed as a condition of approval.
At the developer's option, a separate performance guarantee may
be posted for the privately owned perimeter buffer landscaping.
(2) The Township Engineer shall prepare an itemized cost estimate of
the improvements covered by the performance guarantee, in the
manner specified in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4, which itemized cost
estimate shall be appended to each performance guarantee posted
by the obligor.
(3) The performance guarantee shall consist of a developer's
agreement, the terms of which shall concern the general
development of the tract, plus 10% of the performance guarantee
amount in cash and the remaining 90% by any of the following:
§ 140-91 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-92
139:357
(a) Cash, by means of a bank or treasurer's check.
(b) A performance bond issued by a bonding or surety company
approved by the Township Attorney as to form and content,
which bond shall contain a provision that it shall not expire
until released by the Township Committee.
(c) An irrevocable standby letter of credit must be written in
accordance with the standardized form adopted by regulation
by the Department of Community Affairs pursuant to Section 1
of P.L. 1999, c. 68 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53a) as complying with the
provisions of Section 41 of P.L. 1975, c. 291 (N.J.S.A.
40:55D-53) and approved by the Township Attorney or other
security as may be approved by the Township Committee.
C. An irrevocable letter of credit shall only be accepted if it constitutes an
unconditional payment obligation of the issuer running solely to the
Township for an express initial period of time in the amount required; is
issued by a banking or savings institution authorized to do so and doing
business in the State of New Jersey; is for a period of time of at least
one year; and permits the Township to draw upon the letter of credit if
the obligor fails to furnish another letter of credit which complies with
the provisions of this section 30 days or more in advance of the
expiration date of the letter of credit or such longer period in advance
thereof as is stated in the letter of credit. All guarantees posted herein
shall be in addition to and not in substitution for the developer's
primary responsibility to install the improvements and complete the
subdivision in accordance with all rules, regulations, standards,
specifications, and ordinances of the Township.
D. All performance guarantee amounts shall be computed, by the
Township Engineer based on the documented construction costs for
public improvements prevailing in the general area of the Township.
E. The developer may appeal the Township Engineer's estimate to the
Township Committee. The Township Committee shall decide the appeal
within 45 days of the appeal in writing by the Township Clerk. After the
developer posts a guarantee with the Township based on the cost of
installation of improvements as determined by the Township
Committee, he may institute legal action within one year of the posting
in order to preserve the right to a judicial determination as to the
fairness and reasonableness of the amount of the guarantee.
F. All guarantees shall provide for construction of the required bonded
improvements within two years of the date of their posting. This time
period may be extended by the governing body, in the form of a
resolution granting such extension provided the municipal agency has,
if necessary, extended the period of protection pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-52a. As a condition or as part of any such extension, the amount
of any performance guarantee shall be increased or reduced, as the
case may be, to an amount not to exceed 120% of the cost of the
§ 140-92 WALL CODE § 140-92
139:358
installation, which cost shall be determined by the Township Engineer
as aforesaid. [Amended 8-28-2019 by Ord. No. 10-2019]
G. If the required bonded improvements are not completed or corrected in
accordance with the performance guarantee, the obligor and surety, if
any, shall be liable thereon to the Township for the reasonable cost of
the improvements not completed or corrected and the Township may
either prior to or after the receipt of the proceeds thereof complete
such imporvements. [Amended 8-28-2019 by Ord. No. 10-2019]
H. Request for list of incomplete improvements; filing of monument
certification. [Amended 8-28-2019 by Ord. No. 10-2019]
(1) Upon substantial completion of all required street improvements
(except for the top course) and appurtenant utility improvements,
and the connection of same to the public system, the obligor may
request of the Township Committee, in writing, by certified mail
addressed in care of the Township Clerk that the Township
Engineer prepare, in accordance with the itemized cost estimate
prepared by the Township Engineer and appended to the
performance guarantee pursuant this section, a list of all
uncompleted or unsatisfactorily completed bonded improvements.
If such a request is made, the obligor shall send a copy of the
request to the Township Engineer. The request shall indicate which
bonded improvements have been completed and which bonded
improvements remain uncompleted in the judgment of the obligor.
(2) At the time of the request, the obligor is to file with the Township
Engineer, the surveyor's monument certification; signed and sealed
as-built construction plans; and, if not previously provided, deed(s)
of dedication for roads, detention basin lots, open space areas,
easements or other land areas to be dedicated to the Township all
of which shall be subject to review and approval by the Township
Engineer and Township Attorney.
I. The Township Engineer shall inspect all bonded improvements covered
by the obligor's request and shall file a detailed list and report, in
writing, with the Township Committee, and shall simultaneously send a
copy thereof to the obligor not later than 45 days after the Engineer's
receipt of the obligor's request. [Amended 8-28-2019 by Ord. No.
10-2019]
J. The list prepared by the Township Engineer shall state, in detail, with
respect to each bonded improvement determined to be incomplete or
unsatisfactory, the nature and extent of the incompleteness of each
incomplete bonded improvement or the nature and extent of, and
remedy for, the unsatisfactory state of each completed bonded
improvement determined to be unsatisfactory. The report prepared by
the Township Engineer shall identify each bonded improvement
determined to be complete and satisfactory together with a
recommendation as to the amount of reduction to be made in the
§ 140-92 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-92
139:359
§ 140-93. Posting of maintenance guarantee. [Amended 8-28-2019
by Ord. No. 10-2019]
performance guarantee relating to the completed and satisfactory
bonded improvement, in accordance with the itemized cost estimate
prepared by the Township Engineer and appended to the performance
guarantee. [Amended 8-28-2019 by Ord. No. 10-2019]
K. The Township Committee, by resolution, shall either approve the
bonded improvements determined to be complete and satisfactory by
the Township Engineer or reject any or all of these bonded
improvements upon the establishment in the resolution of cause for
rejection, and shall approve and authorize the amount of reduction to
be made in the performance guarantee relating to the bonded
improvements accepted, in accordance with the itemized cost estimate
prepared by the Township Engineer and appended to the performance
guarantee pursuant to this section. This resolution shall be adopted not
later than 45 days after receipt of the list and report prepared by the
Township Engineer. Upon adoption of the resolution by the Township
Committee, the obligor shall be released from all liability pursuant to its
performance guarantee, with respect to those approved bonded
improvements, except for that portion adequately sufficient to secure
completion or correction of the improvements not yet approved,
provided that 30% of the amount of the performance guarantee posted
shall be retained to ensure completion and acceptability of all
improvements. [Amended 8-28-2019 by Ord. No. 10-2019]
L. In the event that the obligor has posted cash with the Township as part
of the performance guarantee, then any partial reduction granted in the
performance guarantee pursuant to this section shall be applied to the
cash deposit in the same proportion as the original cash deposit bears
to the full amount of the performance guarantee.
M. If any portion of the required bonded improvements is rejected, the
Township Committee may require the obligor to complete or correct
such bonded improvements and, upon completion or correction, the
same procedure of notification, as set forth above shall be followed.
[Amended 8-28-2019 by Ord. No. 10-2019]
A. Prior to the release of all or any portion of the performance guarantee,
a maintenance guarantee shall be posted with the Township Committee
for a period of two years after final acceptance of the improvement, in
the amount not to exceed 15% of the cost of the installation of the
following private site improvements: stormwater management basins,
inflow and water quality structures within the basins, and the outflow
pipes and structures of the stormwater management system, if any,
which cost shall be determined according to the method of calculation
set forth in Section 15 of P.L. 1991, c. 256 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4).
B. In the event that other government agencies or public utilities
automatically will own the utilities to be installed or the improvements

In the event that final approval is by stages or sections of development, the
provisions of this article shall be applied by stages or section.
are covered by a performance or maintenance guarantee to another
governmental agency, no performance or maintenance guarantee, as
the case may be, shall be required for such utilities or improvements.
A. The developer shall reimburse the Township for reasonable inspection
fees paid to the Township Engineer for the foregoing inspection of
improvements which fees shall not exceed the sum of the amounts set
forth herein. The Township shall require the developer to post the
inspection fees in escrow in an amount.
(1) Not to exceed, except for extraordinary circumstances, the greater
of $500 or 5% of the cost of bonded improvements that are subject
to the performance guarantee under § 140-92B;
(2) For those developments for which the reasonably anticipated fees
total less than $10,000, fees may, at the option of the developer, be
paid in two installments. The initial amount deposited in escrow by
a developer shall be 50% of the inspection fees. When the balance
on deposit drops to 10% of the inspection fees because the amount
deposited by the developer has been reduced by the amount paid to
the Township Engineer for inspection, the developer shall deposit
the remaining 50% of the inspection fees.
(3) For those developments for which the inspection fees total $10,000
or greater, fees may, at the option of the developer, be paid in four
installments. The initial amount deposited in escrow by a developer
shall be 25% of the inspection fees. When the balance on deposit
drops to 10% of the inspection fees because the amount deposited
by the developer has been reduced by the amount paid to the
Township Engineer for inspection, the developer shall make
additional deposits of 25% of the inspection fees.
B. If the Township determines that the amount in escrow for the payment
of inspection fees is insufficient to cover the cost of additional required
inspections, the Township may require the developer to deposit
additional funds in escrow, provided that the Township delivers to the
developer a written inspection escrow deposit request, signed by the
Township Engineer, which informs the developer of the need for
additional inspections, details the items or undertakings that require
inspection, estimates the time required for those inspections, and
estimates the cost of performing those inspections.

Ord. No. 10-2019]
A. In the event that the developer shall seek a temporary certificate of
occupancy for a development, unit, lot, building, or phase of
development, as a condition of the issuance thereof, the developer shall
furnish a separate guarantee, referred to herein as a "temporary
certificate of occupancy guarantee," in favor of the Township in an
amount equal to 120% of the cost of installation of only those
improvements or items which remain to be completed or installed
under the terms of the temporary certificate of occupancy and which
are required to be installed or completed as a condition precedent to
the issuance of the permanent certificate of occupancy for the
development, unit, lot, building or phase of development and which are
not covered by an existing performance guarantee.
B. Upon posting of a temporary certificate of occupancy guarantee, all
sums remaining under a performance guarantee, required pursuant to
§ 140-92, which relate to the development, unit, lot, building, or phase
of development for which the temporary certificate of occupancy is
sought, shall be released. At no time may a Township hold more than
one guarantee or bond of any type with respect to the same line item.
C. The scope and amount of the temporary certificate of occupancy
guarantee shall be determined by the Township Engineer.
D. The temporary certificate of occupancy guarantee shall be released by
the Township Engineer or Zoning Officer upon the issuance of a
permanent certificate of occupancy with regard to the development,
unit, lot, building, or phase as to which the temporary certificate of
occupancy relates.
A. In addition to a performance guarantee required pursuant to § 140-92,
a developer shall furnish to the Township a guarantee, referred to
herein as a "safety and stabilization guarantee," either as a separate
guarantee or a line item of the performance guarantee, in favor of the
Township, to be available to the Township solely for the purpose of
returning property that has been disturbed to a safe and stable
condition or otherwise implementing measures to protect the public
from access to an unsafe or unstable condition, only in the
circumstance that:
§ 140-96 WALL CODE § 140-96.2
139:362
(1) Site disturbance has commenced and, thereafter, all work on the
development has ceased for a period of at least 60 consecutive days
following such commencement for reasons other than force
majeure; and
(2) Work has not recommenced within 30 days following the provision
of written notice by the Township to the developer of the
Township's intent to claim payment under the guarantee.
B. The amount for the safety and stabilization guarantee shall be
calculated to equal the following:
(1) For a development with bonded improvements in an amount not
exceeding $100,000, shall be $5,000.
(2) For a development with bonded improvements exceeding
$100,000, shall be calculated as a percentage of the bonded
improvement costs of the development or phase of development as
follows:
(a) $5,000 for the first $100,000 of bonded improvement costs,
plus 2.5% of bonded improvement costs in excess of $100,000
up to $1,000,000, plus 1% of bonded improvement costs in
excess of $1,000,000.
C. The Township shall not provide notice of its intent to claim payment
under a safety and stabilization guarantee until a period of at least 60
days has elapsed during which all work on the development has ceased
for reasons other than force majeure. The Township shall provide
written notice to a developer by certified mail or other form of delivery
providing evidence of receipt.
D. The Township shall release a separate safety and stabilization
guarantee to a developer upon the developer's furnishing of a
performance guarantee which includes a line item for safety and
stabilization in the amount required under this section.
E. The Township shall release a safety and stabilization guarantee upon
the municipal engineer's determination that the development of the
project site has reached a point that the improvements installed are
adequate to avoid any potential threat to public safety.

providing a yard or open space for any other buildings, and no yard or other
open space on one lot shall be considered as providing a yard or open space
for a building on any other lot.
§ 140-115. Responsibility for maintenance of buildings and land.26
It shall be the responsibility of every property owner, tenant, developer and
applicant to maintain in a safe and orderly condition, all buildings and land

A. Purpose.
(1) The purpose of this section is to establish general guidelines for the
siting of wireless communications towers and antennas. The goals
of this section are to:
(a) Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impacts of towers and antennas.
(b) Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas.
(c) Minimize the total number of towers throughout the Township.
(d) Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower
sites as a primary option rather than construction of additional
single-use towers.
§ 140-143 WALL CODE § 140-144
139:398
(e) Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the
extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the
community is minimal.
(f) Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a
way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and
antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening
and innovative camouflaging techniques.
(g) Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications
services to provide such services to the community quickly,
effectively and efficiently.
(h) Consider the public health and safety of communication
towers.
(i) Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower
failure through engineering and careful siting of tower
structures.
(2) In furtherance of these goals, the Township of Wall has given due
consideration to the Township of Wall's Master Plan, Zoning Map,
existing land uses and environmentally sensitive areas in approving
sites for the location of towers and antennas.

tower shall provide to the approving board an inventory of its
§ 140-144 WALL CODE § 140-144
139:400
existing towers, antennas or sites approved for towers or antennas,
that are either within the jurisdiction of the Township or within five
miles of the border thereof, including specific information about
the location, height and design of each tower.
(4) State or federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed
current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any
other agency of the state or federal government with the authority
to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations
are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed
by this section shall bring such towers and antennas into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six
months of the effective date of such standards and regulations,
unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by the
controlling state or federal agency. Failure to bring towers and
antennas into compliance with such revised standards and
regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or
antenna at the owner's expense.
(5) Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity
of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in
compliance with standards contained in applicable state or local
building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are
published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended
from time to time. If, upon inspection, the Township concludes that
a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and
constitutes a danger to persons or property, then, upon notice
being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30
days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards.
Failure to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days
shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at
the owner's expense.

alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or
structures as discussed in Subsection E(4)(a) of this section.
(4) A conditional use permit shall be granted for a wireless
communications tower or antenna, provided that the following
standards and specifications are satisfied:
(a) Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or
alternative technology. No new tower shall be permitted unless
the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of
the approving board that no existing tower, structure or
alternative technology that does not require the use of towers
or structures can accommodate the applicant's proposed
antenna. An applicant shall submit information requested by
the board as to the availability of suitable existing towers,
other structures or alternative technology. Evidence submitted
to demonstrate that no existing tower, structure or alternative
technology can accommodate the applicant's proposed

electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the
existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the
existing towers or structures would cause interference
with the applicant's proposed antenna.
[5] The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the
owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to
adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are
unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development
are presumed to be unreasonable.
[6] The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting
factors that render existing towers and structures
unsuitable.
[7] The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology
that does not require the use of towers or structures, such
§ 140-144 WALL CODE § 140-144
139:404
as a cable microcell network using multiple low-powered
transmitters/receivers attached to a wireline system, is
unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed
new tower or antenna development shall not be presumed
to render the technology unsuitable.
(b) Setbacks and bulk requirements. The following bulk and
setback requirements shall apply to all towers for which
approval is sought:
[1] The lot on which the tower is proposed to be located shall
meet all of the minimum lot size and other bulk
requirements of the zone in which it is located.
[2] Towers must be set back a distance at least equal to the
height of the tower from any adjoining lot line or the
setback requirements of the zoning district, whichever is
greater.
[3] Guys and accessory buildings must satisfy the minimum
zoning district setback requirements.
(c) Separation. The following separation requirements shall apply
to all towers and antennas for which approval is required;
provided, however, that the board may reduce the standard
separation requirements if the goals of this article would be
better served thereby.
[1] Separation from off-site uses/designated areas.
[a] Tower separation shall be measured from the base of
the tower to the lot line of the off-site uses and/or
designated areas as specified in Table 1, except as
otherwise provided in Table 1.

materials that effectively screens the view of the tower
compound from any adjoining property or roadway used
for residences. The standard buffer shall consist of a
landscaped strip at least four feet wide outside the
perimeter of the compound.
[2] In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be
minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or
waived.
[3] Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the
site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In
some cases, such as towers located on large, wooded lots,
natural growth around the property perimeter may be
sufficient buffer.
(f) Aesthetics. Towers and antennas shall meet the following
requirements:
[1] Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or,
subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted
a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.

[3] If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower,
the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical
equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or
closely compatible with, the color of the supporting
structure so as to make the antenna and related
equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
(g) Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted unless
required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is
required, the lighting alternatives and design chosen must
cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
F. Buildings or other equipment storage.

the tower should be removed, the Township may cause the tower to
be removed, and all costs associated with the removal of the tower,
including actual removal costs, all engineering, legal and Township
personnel costs and the cost of public bidding for the contract for
removal of the tower, shall be certified by the Township Committee
to the Tax Collector. The full cost shall be imposed by the Tax
Collector as a lien upon the property to be collected in the same
manner as taxes.
(3) No building permit shall be issued for the construction of a new
tower in the Township until a bond is posted by the applicant
guaranteeing the cost of demolition and removal of the tower in the
event of its abandonment, said bond to be in a form satisfactory to
the Township Attorney as to form and content and in an amount to
be determined by the Township Engineer representing a
reasonable estimation of the costs of demolition and removal of the
tower.

B. Wherever possible, access to truck loading spaces should be separated
from access to automobile parking areas, particularly for any uses
which require large volumes of trucking traffic.
C. Loading spaces shall be separately distinguished from all drive aisles,
refuse areas, parking spaces and pedestrian building access areas. No
loading space shall be designed or constructed to share space with any
other use on site.
A. In computing the number of required parking spaces, where fractional
spaces result, the required number shall be construed to be the next
highest whole number.
B. Only directly accessible parking and loading spaces shall be counted
toward compliance with this article. No parking spaces located within a
garage with individual doors shall be counted.
C. The minimum size of standard parking spaces shall be nine feet by 19
feet where spaces are provided with "looped" or "hairpin" stall
markings, or 10 feet by 19 feet where spaces are provided with singleline
stall markings. The minimum size of large vehicle parking spaces

be immediately required for a particular use, a staged development
plan may be permitted which requires that only a portion of the parking
area subject to the following regulations:
(1) The site plan shall clearly indicate both that portion of the parking
area to be initially paved and the total parking needed to provide
the number of spaces required.
(2) The site plan shall provide for adequate drainage of both the partial
and total parking areas.
(3) The portion of the parking area not to be paved initially shall be
landscaped.
(4) Any change in occupancy on a site for which the Planning Board
may have approved a partial paving of off-street parking areas shall
result in the termination of the staged development plan except
§ 140-217 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-218
139:471
that, where the new use requires a number of parking spaces equal
to or fewer than are provided on the site, the staged development
plan shall automatically be continued.
F. Off-street parking spaces, together with appropriate access thereto,
shall be provided on the same lot as the building it is intended to serve,
except as otherwise herein permitted.
(1) Joint parking facilities. The off-street parking requirements for two
or more nonresidential neighboring uses of the same or different
types located on the same lot or on contiguous lots and within the
same zoning district may be satisfied by the allocation of the
required number of spaces for each use in a common parking
facility, provided that the number of off-street parking spaces is not
less than the sum of individual requirements, and provided, further,
that there be compliance with all other provisions of these
regulations.
(2) Sharing of parking facilities. Off-street parking facilities for one use
shall not be considered as providing the required facilities for any
other use; provided, however, that 1/2 of the off-street parking
space required by any use whose peak attendance will be at night
or on Sundays, such as places of worship, theaters and assembly
halls, may be assigned to a use which will be closed at night or on
Sundays.
G. Handicapped parking shall be provided for all nonresidential use in

ARTICLE XXX
General Requirements
§ 140-229. Purpose.
The purpose of these provisions is to provide minimal standards and
restrictions for the design of structures and improvements in conjunction
with review and approval of subdivision plats and site plans. All sites which
are proposed for such development shall conform to these requirements.
The necessity of adhering to these standards may be waived pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-51. Because the purpose of good subdivision and site design
is to create a functional and attractive development, to minimize adverse
impacts, and to ensure that a project will be an asset to Wall Township, a
developer shall only be permitted to build the maximum density, intensity
of development, and floor area ratio permitted by the zone district schedule
requirements where it is demonstrated that the development adheres to all
design guidelines and standards set forth herein and creates no exceptional
adverse impacts.
§ 140-230. Conformance with guidelines required.
All development shall be designed to provide appropriate improvements
in accordance with the following design standards and objectives. Existing
conditions shall be upgraded to conform with these requirements. Should
improvements be required for which standards and guidelines are not
established, they shall be designed and in accordance with accepted
practices as approved by the approving authority.
§ 140-231. Nature of lot lines.
All existing and proposed lot lines to be created or incorporated in any
subdivision application shall be straight, perpendicular and/or radial in
nature.

ARTICLE XXXI
Circulation Design Standards
§ 140-232. General guidelines.
All development shall provide adequate systems, structures and physical
improvements for the movement of people, goods, water, air, sewerage or
power.
§ 140-233. Roadways and driveways.
Roadways and drives shall provide safe and convenient access for vehicles
of occupants and visitors as well as service and emergency vehicles.
A. Hierarchy. Roadway design shall be consistent with a hierarchical
system of functions. All roadways shall be classified according to their
types. In making a determination as to the classification of a particular
roadway, the provisions of the Master Plan and the existing and
proposed conditions in the vicinity of the development shall be
considered along with the intended function of the roadway itself.
Functional criteria for classifying roadways not specifically designated
in the master plan are as follows:
(1) Freeways. This class of roadway in primarily intended to provide
for movement of large volumes of traffic over long distances at high
speeds with no direct access to adjacent properties.
(2) Primary arterial roadways. This class of roadway is primarily
intended to form an interconnected system serving lengthy trips
and linking major traffic generators. They also serve as carriers of
major regional traffic flows where the freeway system is incomplete
or inadequate. The first and most important function of arterial
roadways is to carry traffic and provision of access to adjoining
property is relegated to a secondary function and is minimized.
Traffic turning onto and off of these roads can reduce capacity and
access points should be restricted as much as possible. With high
traffic volumes and truck traffic, noise levels can be disruptive to
residential areas and arterial roadways should not penetrate
identifiable neighborhoods.
(3) Secondary arterial roadways. This class of roadway is similar to
primary arterial roadways except that they serve shorter trips and
lower traffic volumes.
(4) Collector roadways. Collectors differ from arterials in that they
should not form an interconnected system and are generally not
continuous over long distances. They are intended primarily for
interneighborhood traffic and as feeder roads to industrial and
commercial areas. Some are intended to provide access to
residential neighborhoods and in those cases are exclusively for
that purpose. They should simply carry traffic to the arterials and
§ 140-232 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-233
139:483
should not form linkages and interconnections which would
accommodate unwanted through traffic. This class of roadway is
intended to siphon traffic from local roadways before their capacity
is exceeded and the two functions of traffic movement and property
access are of equal importance. Traffic on collector roadways
should be given priority over local roadways and not interrupted
by sharp turns or stop signs. On-street parking is undesirable and
should be avoided where possible.
(5) Local roadways. Local roadways differ from other roadways in that
they are not intended to carry any through traffic whatsoever. The
intended function of this class of roadway is to provide direct
access to adjoining properties; traffic capacity is of only secondary
importance.
(6) Driveways. Driveways differ from other roadways in that they
connect site facilities to the local roadways. The design of
driveways must be adapted to accommodate a wide variety of
intended facilities such as parking, loading, and passenger dropoff
and the circulation between these various automobile facilities.
Design speed and lane width can be reduced to severely restrict
traffic speed if desired.
B. Layout. Roadways shall be laid out to conform as much as possible to
the topography, to permit efficient drainage and utility systems, and to
require the minimum number of roadways necessary to provide
convenient and safe access to property.
(1) Roadways shall be designed to form an overall system of public and
private ways for the efficient circulation of vehicles in which every
building, facility, parking, loading or service area shall have a
convenient and safe means of ingress and egress.
(2) All roadways shall be properly integrated with the existing and
proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated rights-of-way
established on the Official Map and/or Master Plan.
(a) All roadways shall be properly related to special traffic
generators such as industries, business districts, schools,
places of worship, and shopping centers; to population
densities; and to the pattern of existing and proposed land
uses.
(b) Roadways shall be laid out so as to discourage through traffic
on local roadways, to occupy no more land than is required to
provide access, and to avoid unnecessary fragmentation of
land into smaller blocks.
(c) Roadways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of
buildings and parking or loading areas so as to minimize
conflict of movement between the various types of traffic,
including pedestrian.
§ 140-233 WALL CODE § 140-233
139:484
(d) Roadways shall be designed to enhance the aesthetic qualities
of the roadside.
(e) The rigid rectangular gridiron roadway pattern is discouraged
and the use of curvilinear roadways and U-shaped roadways
shall be encouraged where such use will result in a more
desirable layout.
(f) Looped roadways shall be preferred and stub or cul-de-sac
roadways are discouraged as not in conformance with the
intent of this chapter. No dead-end roadway shall exceed a
length of 700 feet unless turnaround areas are provide at a
rate of one for each 600 linear feet.
(g) All roadways shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as
possible of the building sites at, or above, the grades of the
roadways.
(h) Roadways shall be designed to preserve and enhance scenic
vistas and landmarks.
C. Public rights-of-way and blocks and lots. Public rights-of-way shall be
established to provide reasonable public access and all lots shall front
on a public right-of-way.
(1) The right-of-way shall be measured from lot line to lot line and shall
be sufficiently wide to contain the cartway, curbs, shoulders,
sidewalks, graded areas, utilities and shade trees.
(2) The right-of-way width of a new roadway that is a continuation of
an existing roadway shall in no case be continued at a width less
than the existing roadway.
(3) Block size shall be the maximum consistent with use and shape of
the site and the convenience and safety of the occupants.
(4) Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of
appropriate depths. Exceptions of this prescribed block width shall
be permitted in blocks adjacent to major roadways, railroads, or
waterways.
(5) The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be such as are
appropriate for the locality and the type of development
contemplated, but block lengths in residential areas shall not
exceed 1,200 feet nor be less than 400 feet in length.
(6) In long blocks, easements through the block shall be provided to
accommodate utilities, drainage facilities, or pedestrian traffic.
D. Roadway extensions. The arrangement of roadways shall provide for
the continuation of principal roadways between adjacent properties for
convenient movement of traffic, effective fire protection, for efficient
provision of utilities.
§ 140-233 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-233
139:485
(1) Proposed roadways shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other
physical conditions.
(2) If the adjacent property is undeveloped arid the roadway must be a
dead-end roadway temporarily, the right-of-way shall, except where
reserved, be extended to the property line. A temporary cul-de-sac
turnaround, and/or a T-shaped or L-shaped turnaround shall be
provided on all temporary dead-end roadways, with the notation on
the subdivision plan that land outside the normal roadway right-ofway
shall revert to abutting property owners wherever the roadway
is continued. The approving board may limit the length of
temporary dead-end roadways.
(3) Where a roadway does not extend to the boundary of the
subdivision and its continuation is not required by the approving
authority for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall not be
nearer to such boundary than 50 feet. However, the approving
board may require the reservation of an appropriate easement to
accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian traffic, or utilities. A
cul-de-sac turnaround shall be provided at the end of a permanent
dead-end roadway. For greater convenience to traffic and more
effective policing and fire protection, permanent dead-end
roadways shall be limited in length.
E. Alignment.
(1) Roadways shall be aligned to ensure adequate visibility and to
control the speed of traffic.
(2) Minimum center-line radius, minimum tangent length between
reverse curves, and curb radii requirements shall be as shown in
Exhibit 1 in Subsection F below.
F. Grade. Roadways shall be graded to ensure adequate visibility and to
encourage a smooth flow of traffic.
(1) Grades of roadways shall conform as closely as possible to the
original topography.
(2) A combination of steep grades and curves shall be avoided.
(3) Minimum roadway grade permitted for all roadways shall be 0.5%;
but roadways constructed at this grade shall be closely monitored
and strict attention paid to construction techniques to avoid
ponding. Where topographical conditions permit, a minimum grade
of 0.75% shall be used.
(4) Maximum roadway grade shall be 8%.
(5) Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever
practical. Maximum grade within intersections shall be 5% except
for collectors which shall be 3%.

G. Roadway width. Roadways shall be of suitable width to accommodate
prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access to police, fire fighting,
snow removal, sanitation, and road maintenance equipment, and to
coordinate roads so as to compose a convenient system and avoid
undue hardships to adjoining properties.
(1) Roadways shall conform with the Schedule of Required Roadway
Dimensions.53
(2) Where a nonresidential collector or a collector roadway serving
more than 100 lots intersects with another collector roadway or
major roadway, both the right-of-way and the pavement shall be
widened by 24 feet for a distance of 200 feet back from the
intersection of the center lines of both roadways.
(3) Where no parking is provided, interior drives shall be not less than
12 feet wide for one-way traffic and not less than 20 feet wide for
two-way traffic and shall be not more than 36 feet in width.
H. Intersection of roadways. Roadway intersections shall link separate
roadways with minimal interference of traffic flow.
(1) Hierarchical order. Vehicular access between roadways should
follow a hierarchical order of interconnection insofar as practical.
Direct interconnections between dissimilar classes of roadway
should be avoided and traffic from one class of roadway should be
combined and controlled so as to channel traffic between different
roadway classes conveniently, safely, and in a manner which
minimizes marginal traffic friction and promotes free traffic flow. In
no case shall local roadways connect in such a way as to encourage
their use for through traffic. Changes in roadway class shall occur
at intersections and not along a linear roadway segment.

Water and Sewer
§ 140-238. Water supply.
All development shall be properly connected with an approved functioning
public community water system, either regulated by the Board of Public
Utilities or owned and operated by the Township prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy.
A. Water supply system.
(1) Subdivisions shall be connected to an existing public water supply
system if public service is available within the following distances:
200 feet for one-unit, 400 feet for two-unit, 600 feet for three-unit,
800 feet for four-unit, and 1,000 feet for five-unit to fifteen-unit
developments. For developments of greater than 15 units which are
within one mile from an existing public water system, adequate
justification should be provided as to why they should not provide a
connection to the existing public water supply system. For
developments of greater than 15 units which are more than one
mile from an existing system, the water supply strategy shall be
determined on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration the
density of the development, economic considerations, and
groundwater availability and quality.
(2) If a public water supply system will be provided to the area as
indicated in the municipal Water Master Plan, Official Map, or
other official document, a municipality may require installation of a
capped system or "dry lines" (mains, only) within the road right-ofway;
or alternatively, a municipality may require a payment in lieu
of the improvement.
(3) The water supply system shall be adequate to handle the necessary
flow based on complete development.
(a) The water system shall be designed to carry peak-hour flows
and be capable of delivering the peak hourly demands
indicated in Exhibit 4.

ARTICLE XXXIII
Stormwater Management
[Amended 7-18-2007 by Ord. No. 20-2007]
§ 140-240. Scope and purpose.
A. Policy statement. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant
reduction through nonstructural or low-impact techniques shall be
explored before relying on structural BMPs. Structural BMPs should be
integrated with nonstructural stormwater management strategies and
proper maintenance plans. Nonstructural strategies include both
environmentally sensitive site design and source controls that prevent
pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed to
stormwater. Source control plans should be developed based upon
physical site conditions and the origin, nature, and the anticipated
quantity or amount of potential pollutants. Multiple stormwater
management BMPs may be necessary to achieve the established
performance standards for water quality, quantity, and groundwater
recharge.
B. Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for major
development, as defined in § 140-241.
C. Applicability.
(1) This article shall be applicable to all site plans and subdivisions for
the following major developments that require preliminary or final
site plan or subdivision review:
(a) Nonresidential major developments; and
(b) Aspects of residential major developments that are not
preempted by the Residential Site Improvement Standards at
N.J.A.C. 5:21.
(2) This article shall also be applicable to all major developments
undertaken by the Township of Wall.
D. Compatibility with other requirements. Development approvals issued
for subdivisions and site plans pursuant to this article are to be
considered an integral part of development approvals under the
subdivision and site plan review process and do not relieve the
applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals
for activities regulated by any other applicable code, rule, act, or
ordinance. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
article shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion
of the public health, safety, and general welfare. This article is not
intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinances,
rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law except that, where
any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those

C. Designated as Urban Enterprise Zones; and
Designated as Urban Coordinating Council Empowerment
Neighborhoods.
D.
A. Design and performance standards for stormwater management
measures.
(1) Stormwater management measures for major development shall be
developed to meet the erosion control, groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
standards in § 140-242.1. To the maximum extent practicable,
these standards shall be met by incorporating nonstructural
stormwater management strategies into the design. If these
strategies alone are not sufficient to meet these standards,
structural stormwater management measures necessary to meet
these standards shall be incorporated into the design.
(2) The standards in this article apply only to new major development
and are intended to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on
water quality and water quantity in receiving water bodies and
maintain groundwater recharge. The standards do not apply to new
major development to the extent that alternative design and
performance standards are applicable under a regional stormwater
management plan or water quality management plan adopted in
§ 140-241 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-242
139:507
§ 140-242.1. Stormwater management requirements and standards
for major development.
accordance with Department rules. Such alternative standards
shall provide at least as much protection from stormwater-related
loss of groundwater recharge, stormwater quantity and water
quality impacts of major development projects as would be
provided under the standards in this subchapter.
A. The development shall incorporate a maintenance plan for the
stormwater management measures incorporated into the design of a
major development in accordance with § 140-242.7 of this article.
B. Stormwater management measures shall avoid adverse impacts of
concentrated flow on habitat for threatened and endangered species as
documented in the Department's Landscape Project or Natural
Heritage Database established under N.J.S.A. 13:1B-15.147 through
15.150, particularly Helonias bullata (swamp pink) and/or Clemmys
muhlnebergi (bog turtle).
C. The following linear development projects are exempt from the
groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater
runoff quality requirements of § 140-242.1F and G:
(1) The construction of an underground utility line, provided that the
disturbed areas are revegetated upon completion;
(2) The construction of an aboveground utility line, provided that the
existing conditions are maintained to the maximum extent
practicable; and
(3) The construction of a public pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk
or trail with a maximum width of 14 feet, provided that the access
is made of permeable material.
D. A waiver from strict compliance from the groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
requirements of § 140-242.1F and G may be obtained for the
enlargement of an existing public roadway or railroad; or the
construction or enlargement of a public pedestrian access, provided
that the following conditions are met:
(1) The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the
project that cannot be accomplished by any other means;
(2) The applicant demonstrates through an alternatives analysis that,
through the use of nonstructural and structural stormwater
management strategies and measures, the option selected
complies with the requirements of § 140-242.1F and G to the
maximum extent practicable;
§ 140-242 WALL CODE § 140-242.1
139:508
(3) The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the requirements
of § 140-242.1F and G, existing structures currently in use, such as
homes and buildings, would need to be condemned; and
(4) The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other
rights to areas, including the potential to obtain through
condemnation lands not falling under Subsection D(3) above within
the upstream drainage area of the receiving stream, that would
provide additional opportunities to mitigate the requirements of
§ 140-242.1F and G that were not achievable on site.
E. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in § 140-242.1F
and G shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies set forth herein into the design. The
applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures incorporated
into the design of the project. If the applicant contends that it is not
feasible for engineering, environmental, or safety reasons to
incorporate any nonstructural stormwater management measures
identified in Subsection E(2) below into the design of a particular
project, the applicant shall identify the strategy considered and
provide a basis for the contention.
(2) Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated
into site design shall:
(a) Protect areas that provide water quality benefits or areas
particularly susceptible to erosion and sediment loss;
(b) Minimize impervious surfaces and break up or disconnect the
flow of runoff over impervious surfaces;
(c) Maximize the protection of natural drainage features and
vegetation;
(d) Minimize the decrease in the time of concentration from
preconstruction to postconstruction. "Time of concentration" is
defined as the time it takes for runoff to travel from the
hydraulically most distant point of the watershed to the point
of interest within a watershed;
(e) Minimize land disturbance including clearing and grading;
(f) Minimize soil compaction;
(g) Provide low-maintenance, deer-resistant landscaping that
encourages retention and planting of native vegetation and
minimizes the use of lawns, fertilizers and pesticides;
(h) Provide vegetated open-channel conveyance systems
discharging into and through stable vegetated areas;
§ 140-242.1 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-242.1
139:509
(i) Provide other source controls to prevent or minimize the use or
exposure of pollutants at the site, in order to prevent or
minimize the release of those pollutants into stormwater
runoff. Such source controls include, but are not limited to:
[1] Site design features that help to prevent accumulation of
trash and debris in drainage systems;
[2] Site design features that help to prevent discharge of trash
and debris from drainage systems;
[3] Site design features that help to prevent and/or contain
spills or other harmful accumulations of pollutants at
industrial or commercial developments; and
[4] When establishing vegetation after land disturbance,
applying fertilizer in accordance with the requirements
established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and implementing rules.
(3) Site design features identified under Subsection E(2)(i)[2] above
shall comply with the following standard to control passage of solid
and floatable materials through storm drain inlets. For purposes of
this paragraph, "solid and floatable materials" means sediment,
debris, trash, and other floating, suspended, or settleable solids.
(a) Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a storm
drain or surface water body under that grate:
[1] The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT)
bicycle safe grate, which is described in Chapter 2.4 of the
NJDOT Bicycle Compatible Roadways and Bikeways
Planning and Design Guidelines (April 1996); or
[2] A different grate, if each individual clear space in that
grate has an area of no more than seven square inches, or
is no greater than 0.5 inches across the smallest
dimension. Examples of grates subject to this standard
include grates in grate inlets, the grate portion (non-curbopening
portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm
sewer manholes, ditch grates, trench grates, and grates of
spacer bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground surfaces
include surfaces of roads (including bridges), driveways,
parking areas, bikeways, plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields,
open channels, and stormwater basin floors.
(b) Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear
space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if
the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an
§ 140-242.1 WALL CODE § 140-242.1
139:510
area of no more than seven square inches, or be no greater
than two inches across the smallest dimension.
(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in § 140-242.G(1) are conveyed through any
device (e.g., end-of-pipe netting facility, manufactured
treatment device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed,
at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
[a] A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches
wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inches.
[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars, to
the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified
in § 140-242.1G(1); or
[4] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register-listed historic property.
[5] Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater
management measure to meet the performance standards
in § 140-242.1F and G shall be dedicated to a government
agency, subjected to a conservation restriction filed with
the appropriate county clerk's office, or subject to an
approved equivalent restriction that ensures that measure
or an equivalent stormwater management measure
approved by the reviewing agency is maintained in
perpetuity.
[6] Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management
strategies is available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be
obtained from the address identified in § 140-242.4, or

F. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
actors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at § 140-242.2, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain 100% of the average annual
preconstruction groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from preconstruction to postconstruction for the twoyear
storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the "urban redevelopment area," or to
projects subject to § 140-242.1F(1)(b)[3] below.
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or
applied; areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than "reportable
quantities" as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 C.F.R.
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with Department-approved remedial action work plan
or landfill closure plan and areas with high risks for
spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
§ 140-242.1 WALL CODE § 140-242.1
139:512
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
"Source material" means any material(s) or
machinery, located at an industrial facility, that is
directly or indirectly related to process,
manufacturing or other industrial activities, which
could be a source of pollutants in any industrial
stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source
materials include, but are not limited to, raw
materials; intermediate products; final products;
waste materials; by-products; industrial machinery
and fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents
that are related to process, manufacturing, or other
industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater.
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surface ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
downgradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 140-242.2, complete one of
the following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, postconstruction
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten- and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the
preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten- and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
and projected land uses assuming full development under
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage
area;
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
postconstruction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten- and
one-hundred-year storm events are 50%, 75% and 80%
§ 140-242.1 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-242.1
139:513
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the postconstruction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
site on which the proposed development or project is to
be constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to
postconstruction stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or
[4] In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with § 140-242.1F above shall only
be applied if the increased volume of stormwater runoff
could increase flood damages below the point of
discharge.
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of major development in § 140-241 shall be submitted to
the appropriate soil conservation district for review and approval in
accordance with the requirements of this section and any
applicable soil conservation district guidelines for stormwater
runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purposes of this
section, "agricultural development" means land uses normally
associated with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale.
Such uses do not include the development of land for the
processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally
related products.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
postconstruction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater
runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the developed site,
expressed as an annual average. Stormwater management
measures shall only be required for water quality control if an
additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being proposed on a
development site. The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to
any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric
effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in
a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this
requirement. The water quality design storm is 1.25 inches of
rainfall in two hours. Water quality calculations shall take into
account the distribution of rain from the water quality design
storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation of the volume of
runoff may take into account the implementation of nonstructural
and structural stormwater management measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 140-242.4, or found on the Department's
Web site at www.nistormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other
sources of technical guidance are listed in § 140-242.4. TSS
reduction shall be calculated based on the removal rates for the
BMPs in Table 2 below. Alternative removal rates and methods of
calculating removal rates may be used if the design engineer
provides documentation demonstrating the capability of these
alternative rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any
approved alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate
shall be provided to the Department at the following address:
Division of Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection, PO Box 418, Trenton, New Jersey
08625-0418.
(3) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
eighty-percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize
the following formula to calculate TSS reduction: [Amended
4-8-2009 by Ord. No. 9-2009]
R = A + B - (AXB)/100
Where:
§ 140-242.1 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-242.1
139:515
R = total TSS percent load removal from application of both
BMPs
A = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP
B = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second
BMP

Wet pond 50-90
(4) If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the eighty-percent
TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the
runoff from the subareas converge on site, in which case the
removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a
weighted average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the postconstruction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in § 140-242.1F and G.
(6) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, which may
be obtained from the address identified in § 140-242.4.
(7) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
(8) Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and perennial
or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category
One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the
county soil surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area.
These areas shall be established for the protection of water quality,
§ 140-242.1 WALL CODE § 140-242.1
139:516
aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional
recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance,
and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category
One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A three-hundred-foot special water resource protection
area shall be provided on each side of the waterway,
measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of
the bank outwards or from the center line of the waterway
where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing
vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural
succession.
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area shall only be allowed where
previous development or disturbance has occurred (for
example, active agricultural use, parking area or
maintained lawn area). The encroachment shall only be
allowed where applicant demonstrates that the functional
value and overall condition of the special water resource
protection area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable. In no case shall the remaining special water
resource protection area be reduced to less than 150 feet
as measured perpendicular to the top of bank of the
waterway or center line of the waterway where the bank is
undefined. All encroachments proposed under this
subparagraph shall be subject to review and approval by
the Department.
(b) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the standard for off-site stability in the Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under
the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et
seq.
(c) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
standard for off-site stability in the Standards for Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under the Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq.,
then the stabilization measures in accordance with the
requirements of the above standards may be placed within the
special water resource protection area, provided that:
§ 140-242.1 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-242.1
139:517
§ 140-242.2. Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater
recharge.
[1] Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150 feet
of the Category One waterway;
[2] Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
section shall achieve a ninety-five-percent TSS
postconstruction removal rate;
[3] Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
[4] The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable;
[5] A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate Department staff and soil conservation district
staff to identify necessary stabilization measures; and
[6] All encroachments proposed under this section shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(d) A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan, or by a
municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to § 140-242.1G has been approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection, then the provisions
of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource
protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream
corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to
§ 140-242.1G(8) shall maintain or enhance the current
functional value and overall condition of the special water
resource protection area as defined in § 140-242.1G(8)(a)[1]
above. In no case shall a stream corridor protection plan allow
the reduction of the special water resource protection area to
less than 150 feet as measured perpendicular to the waterway
subject to this subsection.
(e) The provisions of § 140-242.1G(8) does not apply to the
construction of one individual single-family dwelling that is not
part of a larger development on a lot receiving preliminary or
final subdivision approval on or before February 2, 2004,
provided that the construction begins on or before February 2,
2009.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
§ 140-242.1 WALL CODE § 140-242.2
139:518
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Section 4  Hydrology and
Technical Release 55  Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds; or
(b) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition
of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at § 140-242.2A(1)(a) and the Rational and
Modified Rational Methods at § 140-242.2A(1)(a). A runoff
coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing
condition may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design
engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has existed on the
site or portion of the site for at least five years without interruption
prior to the time of application. If more than one land cover have
existed on the site during the five years immediately prior to the
time of application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential
shall be used for the computations. In addition, there is the
presumption that the site is in good hydrologic condition (if the
land use type is pasture, lawn, or park), with good cover (if the land
use type is woods), or with good hydrologic condition and
conservation treatment (if the land use type is cultivation).
[Amended 4-8-2009 by Ord. No. 9-2009]
(3) In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or
culverts, that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55  Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds and other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
§ 140-242.2 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-242.2
139:519
§ 140-242.3. Standards for structural stormwater management
measures.

management measures.
B. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
following: The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32, A Method
for Evaluating Ground-Water Recharge Areas in New Jersey,
incorporated herein by reference, as amended and supplemented.
Information regarding the methodology is available from the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual; at
http://www.state.nj.us/dep/njgs/; or at New Jersey Geological Survey, 29
Arctic Parkway, P.O. Box 427, Trenton, New Jersey 08625-0427; (609)

A. Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as
follows:
(1) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
take into account the existing site conditions, including, for
example, environmentally critical areas, wetlands; flood-prone
areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high water table; soil type,
permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage patterns; and
the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone).
(2) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and
ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the
intake to the outlet structure as appropriate, and shall have parallel
bars with one-inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of the
water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the water
quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure shall
be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the diameter of the
orifice or 1/3 the width of the weir, with a minimum spacing
between bars of one inch and a maximum spacing between bars of
six inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must comply with
the requirements of § 140-242.5.
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosionresistant.
Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions
of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C.
5:21-7.3,7.4, and 7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
(4) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin,
the orifice size shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 inches in diameter.
(5) Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins at
§ 140-242.4.

B. Stormwater management measure guidelines are available in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. Other
stormwater management measures may be utilized, provided the
design engineer demonstrates that the proposed measure and its
design will accomplish the required water quantity, groundwater
recharge and water quality design and performance standards
established in § 140-242.1 of this article.
C. Manufactured treatment devices may be used to meet the requirements
of § 140-242.1, provided the pollutant removal rates are verified by the
New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology and certified by the
Department.
D. Pipe, catch basins, inlets and manholes shall conform to the following:
(1) Pipe size shall be dictated by design runoff and hydraulic capacity.
(2) Hydraulic capacity shall be determined by the Manning equation,
except, where appropriate, capacity shall be based on tailwater
analysis and one-year high tide.
(3) In general, no pipe size in the storm drainage system shall be less
than 15 inches in diameter. A twelve-inch diameter pipe will be
considered as a cross drain to a single inlet. [Amended 4-8-2009
by Ord. No. 9-2009]
(4) All discharge pipes shall terminate with a precast concrete or
corrugated metal end section or a cast-in-place concrete headwall
with or without wingwalls, as conditions require. In normal
circumstances, a cast-in-place concrete headwall is preferred. Use
of other types shall be justified by the designer and approved by the
Engineer.
(5) Pipe bedding shall be provided as specified in Design and
Construction of Sanitary and Storm Sewers, ASCE Manuals and
Reports on Engineering Practice No. 37, prepared by A Joint
Committee of the Society of Civil Engineers and the Water Pollution
Control Federation, New York, 1969.
(6) Inlets, catch basins and manholes shall be designed in accordance
with State Highway Department Standard Plans and Specifications.

in roof configuration, so as to appear to be multiple
structures.
[5] Facades shall be articulated with horizontal divisions to
reflect the traditional building elements of cap, wall and
base. The cap shall feature either pitched roofs or
articulated cornices and a change of color and material.
The wall should include a horizontal division for the top of
the ground story. The base traditionally includes a
watercourse line and is often a more durable material that
articulates how the mass of the building meets its grade.
These architectural divisions shall have sufficient reveal to
promote shadows on the facade of the building.
[6] Building facades facing streets shall contain between
twenty- and fifty-percent nonreflective glass. A significant
percentage of the remainder of the facades shall be
treated with stone, cultured stone, brick or brick veneer.

[7] Primary building materials shall feature earth-tone colors.
For the purposes of this chapter, earth-tone colors are
defined as colors that draw from a palette of muted or
weathered colors in an emulation of the predominant
natural coloration of brown and gray soils, tree bark, leafy
vegetation and rocks. The preferred earth tones on
buildings shall be tans, beiges, sands, browns, warm
grays, and soft greens. In addition, creams, pale peach,
pale yellows, soft blues, cool grays, white, off-whites, and
soft red colors are also acceptable. Accent colors may be
used, provided that they appear as secondary visual
elements to the primary materials. Bold, disjointed or
recognizable color combinations or color patterns that
form a corporate or commercial identity or logo shall be
considered a sign for the purposes of this section and shall
be prohibited. [Amended 11-25-2014 by Ord. No.

sandblasted wood, and simulated wood when routed or
sandblasted and painted, and masonry such as natural stone or
brick. Acceptable support materials for freestanding signs
include but are not limited to brick, natural stone and painted
wood.
(h) Grading.
[1] The proposed grading shall respect and complement the
existing topographic features of Wall Township, and shall
protect natural resources and environmentally sensitive
areas. Slopes shall be no greater than 3:1, except slopes
along a right-of-way, which shall be no steeper than a ratio
of 5:1 (horizontal to vertical). If a proposed slope exceeds
10 feet in elevation change, the slope should undulate in
conformity with that of existing naturally occurring slopes.
[2] If retaining walls are proposed, no single wall may exceed
six feet in height. Tiered walls may be proposed, provided
that no single tier exceeds five feet, and no more than
three tiers may be proposed, and where a minimum of 10
feet horizontal is provided between tiers.
§ 140-252 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-252

[3] Retaining walls shall be constructed of durable masonry
materials that complement the site design and building
architecture, such as brick and natural fieldstone facing.
Timber retaining walls shall not be permitted.
(i) Lighting.
[1] All outdoor lighting shall be aimed, located, designed,
fitted and maintained so as not to present a disabling glare
hazard to drivers or a nuisance to neighboring properties.
[2] Directional fixtures such as floodlights and spotlights shall
not be permitted.
[3] Glare shall be controlled through the use of sharp cutoff
fixtures, the appropriate application of mounting height,
wattage, aiming, fixture placement, and fixture design,
etc. and the addition of shields and baffles as necessary.
[4] Lighting shall be controlled by automatic switching
devices, such as timers, motion detectors, and/or
photocells, to extinguish potentially offending,
nonessential light sources overnight, to minimize glare
and sky-lighting consequences.
[5] Externally illuminated signs shall be lighted by fixtures
mounted at the top of the sign, wherever feasible, and
aimed downward, rather than by fixtures mounted at the
bottom of the sign and aimed up.
[6] Freestanding signs shall not be internally illuminated.

§ 140-256. Slopes.
B. Topsoil protection. No topsoil shall be removed from the site or used as
spoil. Topsoil moved during the course of construction shall be
redistributed so as to provide nearly equal amounts to all areas of the
subdivision and shall be stabilized by seeding or planting on all slopes
up to 10% as shown on the final grading plan. All slopes and minor
drainage swales over 10% shall be sodded. All major drainage swales
shall be sodded or stabilized by fiber mats. Before construction of the
development has begun, selected samples of the existing topsoil at
various locations of the site shall be taken as directed by the Township
Engineer and shall be sent to Rutgers University for analysis and
classification. During the course of construction as lots are finished as
to grading, seeding, etc., selected samples shall again be taken as
directed by the Township Engineer and sent to Rutgers University for
analysis, classification and comparison with the original sample of the
general area to determine whether topsoil has been properly preserved
and redistributed.
A. Slope plantings. Landscaping of the area of all cuts and fills and/or
terraces shall be sufficient to prevent erosion, and all roadway slopes
steeper than one-foot vertically to three feet horizontally shall be
planted with ground covers appropriate for the purpose and soil
conditions, water availability, and environment.
B. Changes in grade levels. Changes of grade levels may be achieved by
any combination of the following methods, and minimum standards
shall be found in the Township construction specifications.
C. Raised flower beds shall be constructed with timber, railroad ties, brick,
brick veneer, precast stone, rock, stone or similar materials. Precast
planters, as well as planters constructed on site, shall have properly
designed drainage or weeping holes and shall incorporate proper
footings where required.
D. Terracing shall be designed to prevent soil erosion.
(1) Turf by grade levels of soil with turf providing grade differential.

appropriate approved selective thinning, the result of which will
encourage the healthy woodland growth of existing trees and
shrubs which enhances the degree of recharge. No removal of
trees, shrubs, etc., on the list of New Jersey protected trees will be
permitted. Landscaping of this buffer zone is permitted in keeping
with a natural setting. The type and amount of vegetation cover
shall encourage the stabilization of the soil and prevent erosion and
increased runoff.
A. Protection of existing plantings. Maximum effort should be made to

not limited to, an inclusionary development, a municipal construction
project, or a one-hundred-percent affordable development.

districts, residential developers, except for developers of the
types of development specifically exempted below, shall pay a
fee of 1.5% of the equalized assessed value for residential
development, provided no increased density is permitted.
(b) When an increase in residential density pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-70d(5) (known as a "d" variance) has been permitted,
developers shall be required to pay a development fee of 6% of
the equalized assessed value (EAV) for each additional unit
above that permitted by right which may be realized. However,
if the zoning on a site has changed during the two-year period
preceding the filing of such a variance application, the base
density for the purposes of calculating the bonus development
fee shall be the highest density permitted by right during the
two-year period preceding the filing of the variance
application. (Example: If an approval allows four units to be
constructed on a site that was zoned for two units, the fees

demolished and replaced, or is expanded, if the expansion is
not otherwise exempt from the development fee requirement.
§ 140-283 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-283
139:573
The development fee shall be calculated on the increase in the
equalized assessed value of the improved structure.
(d) Nonprofit organizations which have received tax exempt status
pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code,
providing current evidence of that status is submitted to the
Municipal Clerk, together with a certification that services of
the organization are provided at reduced rates to those who
establish an inability to pay existing charges, shall be
exempted from paying a development fee.

assessed value of the land and improvements, for all new
nonresidential construction on an unimproved lot or lots.
(b) Nonresidential developers, except for developers of the types
of development specifically exempted, shall also pay a fee
equal to 2.5% of the increase in equalized assessed value
resulting from any additions to existing structures to be used
for nonresidential purposes.
(c) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an
existing structure is demolished and replaced. The
development fee of 2.5% shall be calculated on the difference
between the equalized assessed value of the preexisting land
and improvement and the equalized assessed value of the
newly improved structure, i.e. land and improvement, at the
time final certificate of occupancy is issued. If the calculation
required under this section results in a negative number, the
nonresidential development fee shall be zero.
(2) Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for
nonresidential development.
(a) The nonresidential portion of a mixed-use inclusionary or
market rate development shall be subject to the development

by a developer shall be substantiated by that developer.
(d) A developer of a nonresidential development exempted from
the nonresidential development fee pursuant to P.L. 2008, c.46
shall be subject to it at such time the basis for the exemption
no longer applies, and shall make the payment of the
nonresidential development fee, in that event, within three
years after that event or after the issuance of the final
certificate of occupancy of the nonresidential development,
whichever is later.
(e) If a property which was exempted from the collection of a
nonresidential development fee thereafter ceases to be exempt
from property taxation, the owner of the property shall remit
the fees required pursuant to this section within 45 days of the
termination of the property tax exemption. Unpaid

(2) Funds shall not be expended to reimburse the Township of Wall for
past housing activities.
(3) At least 30% of all development fees collected and interest earned
shall be used to provide affordability assistance to low- and
moderate-income households in affordable units included in the

of its substantive certification or its judgment of compliance; nor shall
the Township of Wall retroactively impose a development fee on such a
development. The Township of Wall shall not expend development fees
after the expiration of its substantive certification or its judgment of

K. Resolution of conflicting provisions. Notwithstanding the provisions of
any other ordinance to the contrary, the provisions of this section shall
apply to the development within the Mount Laurel zoning districts

ARTICLE XLII
Inclusionary Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Regulations
§ 140-285. Minimum affordability requirements.
Developers of inclusionary housing units of low- and moderate-income
persons and families shall enter into a written agreement, binding on all
successors-in-interest in accordance with N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.3 et seq. of Resale/
Rental Control, that not less than 10% of the total units constructed shall
be affordable to low-income persons and families, and not less than 10% of
the total units constructed shall be affordable to moderate-income persons
and families at the time of sale, resale, rental or rerental regardless of the
availability of federal, state, county or Township subsidy programs.
§ 140-286. Determination of maximum affordability of sales and
rental housing units.
The affordability of a low- or moderate-income unit shall be a function of the
rent or sales price which shall be established so as to ensure that occupants
do not pay a sum for shelter costs greater than approximately 30% of
gross annual income for rental units or approximately 28% of gross annual
income for sales units in accordance with Council on Affordable Housing
regulations as follows:
A. Shelter costs for rental units shall include gross rent, including an
allowance for utilities, so as not to exceed 30% of the gross monthly
income of the appropriate household size referenced in Subsection D
below. Those tenant-paid utilities that are included in the utility
allowance shall be so stated in the lease. The allowance for utilities
shall be consistent with the utility allowance approved by the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development for use in New Jersey.
"Utility allowance" means those expenses that are in addition to the
base rent, such as heat, electricity and cooking fuel, that are included in
the thirty-percent utility allowance as outlined in the lease.
B. Shelter costs for sales units shall include principal, interest, taxes,
condominium fees and insurance.
C. The initial price of a low- and moderate-income owner-occupied singlefamily
housing unit shall be established so that after a down payment of
5% (based on a mortgage loan equal to 95% of the purchase price and a
market rate of interest), the monthly principal, interest, homeowner
and private mortgage insurances, property taxes (property taxes shall
be based on the restricted value of low- and moderate-income units)
and condominium or homeowner fees do not exceed 28% of the eligible
gross monthly income. Master deeds of inclusionary developments shall
regulate condominium or homeowner association fees or special
assessments of low- and moderate-income purchasers at a specific
percentage of those paid by market purchasers. The percentage that
shall be paid by low- and moderate-income purchasers shall be at least
1/3 of the condominium or homeowner association fees paid by market
§ 140-285 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-286
139:581
purchasers. Once established within the master deed, the percentage
shall not be amended without prior approval from COAH. Price
restrictions for ownership units shall conform to N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.6,
Price Restrictions for Ownership Units.
D. Rental and sales costs shall be fixed for a unit depending on bedroom
number calculated on the following basis as to household size:
(1) Efficiency units shall be affordable to one person households;
(2) One-bedroom units shall be affordable to households of 1 1/2
persons.;
(3) Two-bedroom units shall be affordable to households of three
persons; and
(4) Three-bedroom units shall be affordable to households of 4.5
persons.
E. Bedroom distribution. The following bedroom distribution shall apply to
the total number of affordable units in each development providing
affordable housing units:
(1) Inclusionary developments that are not age restricted shall be
structured in conjunction with realistic market demands so that:
(a) The combination of efficiency and one-bedroom units is at least
10% and no greater than 20% of the total low- and moderateincome
units.
(b) At least 30% of all low- and moderate-income units are twobedroom
units; and
(c) At least 20% of all low- and moderate-income units are threebedroom
units.
(d) At least 1/3 of all units in each bedroom distribution pursuant
to N.J.A.C. 5:93-7.3 shall be affordable to low-income
households.
(e) In the event the Rules of the Council on Affordable Housing
shall provide for a bedroom mix different than the foregoing,
the requirements of COAH shall control and the foregoing shall
be deemed modified for all projects which have not received
final site plan or subdivision approval.
(2) Age-restricted low- and moderate-income units may utilize a
modified bedroom distribution. At a minimum, the number of
bedrooms may equal the number of age-restricted low- and
moderate-income units within the exclusionary development. The
standard can be met by creating all one-bedroom units or by
creating a two-bedroom unit for each efficiency unit. Applications
§ 140-286 WALL CODE § 140-286
139:582
to waive this standard shall be made in accordance with N.J.A.C.
5:93-15, Waiver Provisions.
F. In the case of owner-occupied housing rehabilitation assistance,
affordability shall be based on unit occupancy by a low- or moderateincome
household.
G. Median income by household size will be established by a regional
weighted average of the uncapped Section 8 income limits published by
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in
accordance with N.J.A.C. 5:93-7.4(b). To compute this regional income
limit, the HUD determination of median county income for a family of
four is multiplied by the households within the county. The resulting
product for each county within the housing region is summed. The sum
is divided by the estimated total households in each housing region.
This quotient represents the regional weighted average of median
income for a household of four. This regional weighted average is
adjusted by household size based on multipliers used by HUD to adjust
median income by household size. The maximum average rent and sales
price of low- and moderate-income units within each inclusionary
development shall be affordable to households earning no more than
70% of median income in accordance with N.J.A.C. 5:93-7.4(b).
Moderate-income sales units shall be available for at least two different
prices and low-income sales units to be available for at least two
different prices. In averaging the 57.5%, developers and/or municipal
sponsors of rental units may establish one rent for a low-income unit
and one rent for a moderate-income unit for each bedroom distribution.
H. For initial occupancy, priority shall be given to households that fall
within the median income categories delineated in Subsection G above.
I. Phasing of affordable units.
(1) Affordable housing units in ML Zoning Districts shall be built,
occupied and receive a certificate of occupancy in accordance with
the following schedule. For purposes of this section, a completed
unit is one which has received its certificate of occupancy.
Minimum Percentage of
Low- and Moderate-Income
Percentage of Market Units
Completed
0 25
10 25 + 1 unit
50 50
75 75
100 100
(2) No initial occupancy of a low- or moderate-income housing sales
unit shall be permitted prior to issuance of a certificate of
occupancy, and no certificate of occupancy for initial occupancy of
a low- or moderate-income housing sales unit shall issue unless
§ 140-286 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-286
139:583
there is a written determination by the authority that the unit is to
be controlled by a deed restriction and mortgage lien as adopted
by COAH.
(3) A certificate of reoccupancy for any occupancy of a low- or
moderate-income housing sales unit resulting from a resale shall be
required, and the Township shall not issue such certificate unless
there is a written determination by the authority that the unit is to
be controlled by the deed restriction and mortgage lien required by
the COAH.
(4) The certificate of reoccupancy shall not be required where there is
a written determination by the authority that controls are allowed
to expire or in that the repayment option is being exercised
pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.4.
J. Sale/rental and resale/rerental controls. A developer of a Mount Laurel
development shall incorporate deed restrictions on all dwelling units
sold as units affordable to low- and moderate-income households
pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.2, Council on Affordable Housing
Substantive Rules. Affordability controls shall remain in force for 30
years in accordance with N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.2(a), shall run with the land
and shall require all conveyances of newly constructed low- and
moderate-income sales units subject to this chapter and N.J.A.C. 5:91
and 5:93 to contain the deed restriction and mortgage lien
requirements adopted by COAH as contained in N.J.A.C. 5:93 Appendix
E and upon the resale/rerental of affordable units in accordance with
N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.4 through 5:93-9.16.
K. Annual indexed increases while controls are in place: sales and rentals.
(1) The price of an owner-occupied housing unit may increase annually
based on the percentage increase in the regional median income
limit for each housing region. In no event shall the maximum resale
price established by the authority be lower than the last recorded
purchase price.
(2) With the exception of rentals constructed pursuant to low-income
tax credit regulations, the rent of a low- or moderate-income
housing unit may be increased annually based on the percentage
increase in the housing consumer price index for the United States.
This increase shall not exceed 9% in any one year. Rents for units
constructed pursuant to low-income tax credit regulations shall be
indexed pursuant to the regulations governing low-income tax
credits.
L. Assisted living residences as defined in N.J.A.C. 5:93-1.3, Definitions,

moderate-income apartments in an assisted living residence.
M. Eligible capital improvements prior to the expiration of controls: sales
units.
(1) Property owners of single-family owner-occupied housing may
apply to the authority for permission to increase the maximum
price for eligible capital improvements. Eligible capital
improvements shall be those that render the unit suitable for a
larger household. In no event shall the maximum price of an
improved housing unit exceed the limits of affordability for the
larger household. Property owners shall apply to the authority if an
increase in the maximum sales price is sought.
(2) At resale, all items of property which are permanently affixed to the
units and/or were included when the unit was initially restricted
(for example, refrigerator, range, washer, dryer, dishwasher, wallto-
wall carpeting) shall be included in the maximum allowable
resale price. Other items of property may be sold to the purchaser
at a reasonable price that has been approved by the authority at the
time of signing the agreement to purchase. The purchase of central
air conditioning installed subsequent to the initial sale of the unit
and not included in the base price may be made a condition of the
unit resale, provided the price has been approved by the authority.
Unless otherwise permitted by COAH, the purchase of any property
other than central air conditioning shall not be made a condition of
the unit resale. The owner and the purchaser must personally
certify at the time of closing that no unapproved transfer of funds
for the purpose of selling and receiving property has taken place at
resale.
N. Exempt sales. Sales exempted from resale/rerental controls shall
include the transfer of ownership between husband and wife, the
transfer of ownership between former spouses ordered as a result of a
judicial decree of divorce or judicial separation but not including sales
to third parties, the transfer of ownership between family members as a
result of inheritance, the transfer of ownership through an executor's
deed to a Class A beneficiary, and the transfer of ownership by Court
order.
O. Deed restrictions, notice of sale. All deed restrictions governing lowand
moderate-income housing units shall require the owner to notify
the authority and COAH by certified mail of any intent to sell the unit at
least 90 days prior to entering into an agreement for the first
nonexempt sale after controls have been in effect on the housing unit
for the period specified in N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.2.
P. Subsidy to ensure affordability prior to the expiration of controls, sales
units. If the use of median income data adopted by COAH to index the
cost of housing renders a unit unaffordable to a low- or moderate-
§ 140-286 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-286

§ 140-287. Procedures for initial sales, resale prior to the
expiration of controls, and rentals.
income household at the time of resale, a municipality shall not lose
credit for the housing unit, provided that adequate controls on
affordability remain in place but the municipality may subsidize the
housing unit to maintain affordability.
A. Low- and moderate-income sales units shall not be offered to nonincome-
eligible households at initial sale without COAH approval.
Parties that petition COAH for such approval shall document efforts to
sell housing units to income-eligible households and shall adhere to the
procedures outlined in N.J.A.C. 5:91-12, Subsidy to Ensure Affordability
Prior to Expiration of Controls; Sales Units.
B. Persons wishing to sell affordable units shall notify the authority
responsible for assuring affordability of the intent to sell. If no eligible
buyer enters a contract of sale for the unit within 90 days of
notification, the authority shall have the option to purchase the unit for
a negotiated price that shall not exceed the maximum price permitted
based on the regional increase in the median income as defined by the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development or other
recognized standard adopted by COAH. If the authority does not
purchase the unit, the seller may apply for permission to offer the unit
to a non-income-eligible household at the maximum price permitted.
The seller shall document efforts to sell the unit to an income-eligible
household as part of this application. In reviewing the request, the
authority shall consider the specific reasons for any delay in selling the
housing unit and the hardship to the seller in continuing to offer the
affordable unit to an income-eligible applicant. The inability to sell a
unit for the maximum permitted resale price shall not, in itself, be
considered an appropriate reason for allowing a housing unit to be sold
to a non-income-eligible household. If the request is granted the seller
may offer a low-income housing unit to a moderate-income household
and a moderate-income housing unit to a household earning in excess of
80% of median. In no case shall the seller be permitted to receive more
than the maximum price permitted. In no case shall a sale pursuant to
this section eliminate the resale controls on the unit or permit any
subsequent seller to convey the unit except in full compliance with the
terms of this Part 6.
C. Owners of low- and moderate-income rental units shall not offer rental
units to non-income-eligible households without prior approval of
COAH. Parties that petition for such approval shall document all efforts
to rent to income-eligible households and demonstrate to the
satisfaction of COAH that alternatives, such as a reduction in rent, is
not feasible. Parties that petition COAH shall adhere to the procedures
outlined in N.J.A.C. 5:91-12, Subsidy to Ensure Affordability Prior to
Expiration of Controls; Sales Units.

139:586
§ 140-288. Uniform deed restriction liens and enforcement through
certificates of occupancy or reoccupancy on sales units.
§ 140-289. Option-to-buy sales units.
A. The authority shall issue written determinations for the purpose of
issuing certificates of occupancy for initial occupancy or certificates of
reoccupancy for low- or moderate-income sales units the authority finds
that the unit is to be controlled by a deed restriction and mortgage lien
as adopted by COAH.
B. The authority shall not permit the initial occupancy of a low- or
moderate-income sales unit prior to issuance of a certificate of
occupancy in accordance with Subsection A above.
C. The authority shall issue written determinations for the purpose of
issuing certificates of reoccupancy for low- or moderate-income
housing sales units where the authority finds that the unit is to be
controlled by a deed restriction and mortgage lien as adopted by COAH.
Purchasers of low- and moderate-income housing sales units shall
execute the deed restriction and mortgage lien prior to issuance of a
certificate of occupancy regardless of whether the sellers had executed
the deed restriction and mortgage lien adopted by COAH upon
acquisition of the property. The authority shall make such
determination within 10 days of receipt of a proposed deed restriction
and mortgage lien.
D. The authority shall issue written determinations for the purpose of
issuing certificates of reoccupancy for low- or moderate-income
housing sales units where the authority finds that the unit is sold and
controls are allowed to expire or in which the repayment option is being
exercised pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.4.
E. The mortgage lien and the deed restrictions shall be filed with the Clerk
of Monmouth County. The lien and deed restrictions shall be in the form
adopted by COAH unless amendments have been approved by COAH.
F. The deed restrictions, including the repayment clause, and the
mortgage lien shall have priority over all mortgages on the property
except for a first mortgage placed on the property by the mortgagee
prior to the expiration of resale controls.
A. General regulations. Rights to buy sales units shall be held and
exercised in accordance with the following provisions:
(1) The deed restrictions governing the deeds of low- and moderateincome
units shall include an option permitting purchase of the
affordable housing unit at the maximum allowable restricted sales
price at the time of the first nonexempt sale after controls on
affordability have been in effect on the unit for the period specified
in N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.4. The option to buy shall be first available to Wall
Township, then the Department of Community Affairs, Housing and
§ 140-288 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-289
139:587
Mortgage Finance Agency, or a qualified nonprofit agency as
determined by COAH.
(2) All deed restrictions governing low- and moderate-income units
shall require the owner to notify the authority and COAH by
certified mail of any intent to sell the unit at least 90 days prior to
entering into an agreement for the first nonexempt sale after
controls have been in effect on the housing unit for the period
specified in N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.2.
(3) Upon receipt of such notice, the option to buy the unit at the
maximum allowable restricted sales price shall be available for 90
days. The authority shall first notify Wall Township, then the
Department of Community Affairs, Housing and Mortgage Finance
Agency, and COAH that the unit is for sale. If Wall Township
exercises this option, it may enter into a contract of sale. If Wall
Township fails to exercise this option within 90 days, the first of the
other entities giving notice to the seller of its intent to purchase
during the ninety-day period shall be entitled to purchase the unit.
If the option to purchase the unit at the maximum allowable
restricted sales price is not exercised by a written offer to purchase
the housing unit within 90 days of receipt of the intent to sell, the
owner may proceed to sell the housing unit. If the owner does not
sell the unit within one year of the date of the delivery of notice of
intent to sell, the option to buy the unit shall be restored, and the
owner shall be required to submit a new notice of intent to sell at
least 90 days prior to any future proposed date of sale.
(4) Any option to buy a housing unit at the maximum allowable
restricted sales price shall be exercised by certified mail and shall
be deemed exercised upon mailing.
B. Municipal option.
(1) Wall Township may elect to purchase a low- or moderate-income
unit provided for in N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.4, and may:
(a) Convey or rent the housing unit to a low- or moderate-income
purchaser or tenant at a price or rent not to exceed the
maximum allowable restricted sales price or rental for a period
of up to 30 years, provided the unit is controlled by a deed
restriction in accordance with Technical Appendix E of N.J.A.C.
5:93-1 et seq. or an alternative approved by COAH; or
(b) Convey the unit at fair market value subject to the provisions of
the following Subsection C.
(2) Upon purchase, Wall Township may maintain the unit as an
affordable housing unit or convey it at fair market value in
accordance with the following:

139:588
(a) Notify COAH of any proposed sale and sales price 90 days
before closing;
(b) Notify COAH of the price differential as defined in COAH
regulations;
(3) Deposit the price differential in the Wall Township Affordable
Housing Trust Fund as set forth in § 140-282, Affordable Housing
Trust Fund.
(4) Money deposited in the Affordable Housing Trust Fund from such
sale may not be expended until the Township submits and COAH or
the Court approves a repayment housing plan. COAH or the Court
may approve the repayment housing plan if it determines that it
provides a realistic opportunity for the creation, rehabilitation or
maintenance of low- and moderate-income housing.
C. State option. When the Department of Community Affairs or Housing
and Mortgage Finance Agency elects to purchase a low- or moderateincome
unit pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.4, it may:
(1) Convey or rent the housing unit to a low- or moderate-income
purchaser or tenant at a price or rent not to exceed the allowable
restricted sales price or rental; or
(2) Convey the unit at fair market value and utilize the price
differential to subsidize the construction, rehabilitation or
maintenance of low- and moderate-income housing within the East
Central Housing Region (Monmouth, Ocean and Mercer Counties).
D. Nonprofit option.
(1) Nonprofit agencies may apply to COAH at any time for the right to
purchase low- or moderate-income units subsequent to the period
of controls on affordability, provided the unit remains controlled by
a deed restriction in accordance with Technical Appendix E in
N.J.A.C. 5:93-1 et seq., or an alternative approved by COAH.
(2) Nonprofit agencies that have been designated by COAH shall be
eligible to purchase low- or moderate-income units pursuant to
N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.4 for the sole purpose of conveying or renting the
housing unit to a low- or moderate-income purchaser or tenant at a
price or rent not to exceed the allowable restricted sales price or
rental. Low-income units shall be made available to low-income
purchasers or tenants and the housing unit shall be regulated by
the deed restrictions and lien adopted by COAH. The term of the
controls on affordability shall be the same as those required by
N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.2.
E. Seller option.
(1) An eligible seller of a low- or moderate-income unit which has been
controlled for the period established in N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.2, who has
§ 140-289 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-289
139:589
provided notice of an intent to sell may proceed with the sale if
no eligible entity as outlined in N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.4(c) and N.J.A.C.
5:93-9.7 exercises its option to purchase within 90 days.
(2) Subject to N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.9, the seller may elect to:
(a) Sell to a qualified low- and moderate-income household at the
controlled unit sales price in accordance with existing COAH
regulations, providing the unit is regulated by the deed
restrictions and lien adopted by COAH and included in N.J.A.C.
5:93-1, Technical Appendix E, for a period of at least 30 years;
or
(b) Exercise the repayment option and sell to any purchaser at
market price, providing that 95% of the price differential is
paid to the authority, as an instrument of Wall Township, at
closing.
(3) If the sale will be to a qualified low- and moderate-income
household, the authority shall certify the income qualifications of
the purchaser and shall ensure the housing unit is regulated by the
deed restrictions and lien required by COAH and included in
N.J.A.C. 5:93-1 in Technical Appendix E.
(4) The authority shall examine any contract of sale containing a
repayment option to determine if the proposed sales price bears a
reasonable relationship to the housing unit's fair market value. In
making this determination, the authority may rely on comparable
sales data or an appraisal. The authority shall not approve any
contract of sale where there is a determination that the sales price
does not bear a reasonable relationship to fair market value. The
authority shall make a determination within 20 days of receipt of
the contract of sale and shall calculate the repayment option
payment.
(5) The authority shall adopt an appeal procedure by which a seller
may submit written documentation requesting the authority to
recompute the repayment obligation if the seller believes an error
has been made or to reconsider a determination that a sales price
does not bear a reasonable relationship to fair market value. A
repayment obligation determination made as a result of an owner's
appeal shall be a final administrative determination of the
authority.
(6) The repayment shall occur at the date of closing and transfer of
title for the first nonexempt transaction after the expiration of
controls on affordability.
(7) Repayment proceeds shall be deposited in the Wall Township
Affordable Housing Trust Fund. Money deposited in the Wall
Township Affordable Housing Trust Fund trust account from such
sale may not be expended until Wall Township submits and COAH
§ 140-289 WALL CODE § 140-289
139:590
or a Court approves a repayment housing plan. COAH or a Court
may approve the repayment housing plan if it determines that it
provides a realistic opportunity for the creation, rehabilitation or
maintenance of low- and moderate-income housing.
F. Township rejection of repayment option; sales units.
(1) Wall Township shall have the right to determine that the most
desirable means of promoting an adequate supply of low- and
moderate-income housing is to prohibit the exercise of the
repayment option and maintain controls on lower income housing
units sold within the Township beyond the period required by
N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.2. Such determination shall be made by resolution
of the Township Committee and shall be effective upon filing with
COAH or a Court and the authority. The resolution shall specify the
time period for which the repayment option shall not be applicable.
During such period, no seller in Wall Township may utilize the
repayment option permitted by N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.8.
(2) If the Township exercises the option outlined in F(1), it shall:
(a) Provide public notice in a newspaper of general circulation;
and
(b) Notify the authority and COAH or a Court of the Township
Committee's action.
(3) The authority shall ensure that the deed restriction on all affected
housing units reflects the extended period of controls.
G. Continued application of options to create, rehabilitate or maintain lowand
moderate-income units. When a housing unit has been maintained
as a low- or moderate-income unit after controls have been in effect for
the period specified in N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.2, the deed restrictions governing
the housing units shall allow the Township, the state, nonprofit agencies
and sellers of low- and moderate-income units to again exercise all the
same options as provided in this Part 6.
H. Impact of foreclosure on resale while controls are in place; sales units.
A judgment of foreclosure or a deed in lieu of foreclosure to a financial
institution regulated by state and/or federal law or to a lender on the
secondary mortgage market (including, but not limited to, the Federal
National Mortgage Association, the Home Loan Mortgage Corporation,
the Government National Mortgage Association or an entity acting on
their behalf) shall extinguish controls on affordable housing units,
provided there is compliance with N.J.A.C. 5:93-2.14. Notice of
foreclosure shall allow the authority, the municipality, the Department
of Community Affairs, the Agency or a nonprofit entity to purchase the
affordable housing unit at a negotiated price not to exceed the
maximum permitted sales price and maintain it as an affordable unit for
the balance of the intended period of controls. Failure to purchase the
affordable housing unit shall result in COAH adding that unit to the
§ 140-289 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-289
139:591
§ 140-290. Age restriction.
The sales and rentals of not more than 25% of the affordable housing
units constructed within ML Zoning Districts within the Township may be
age restricted to senior citizens aged 62 or older as defined by and in
accordance with the Federal Fair Housing Act 42 USC 3601 et seq. and
N.J.A.C. 5:93-5.1 and N.J.A.C. 5:93-5.12. A request to age restrict housing
municipal present and prospective fair share obligation. Failure of the
financial institution to provide notice of a foreclosure action to the
authority shall not impair any of the financial institution's rights to
recoup loan proceeds, shall not negate the extinguishment of controls
or the validity of the foreclosure and shall create no cause of action
against the financial institution.
I. Excess proceeds upon foreclosures; sales units. In the event of a
foreclosure sale, the owner of the affordable housing unit shall be
personally obligated to pay to the authority responsible for assuring
affordability, any surplus funds, but only to the extent that such surplus
funds exceed the difference between the sales price at the time of
foreclosure and the amount necessary to redeem the debt to the
financial institution including costs of foreclosure.
J. Length of controls for rehabilitated, conversion and accessory
apartment housing units.
(1) Rehabilitated renter-occupied housing units that are improved to
code standard shall be subject to affordability controls for at least
10 years.
(2) Newly constructed low- and moderate-income rental units shall
remain affordable to low- and moderate-income households for a
period of 30 years. Affordability controls on rental units may
exceed the prescribed ten-year period if the developer agrees to a
longer period.
(3) Housing units created through conversion of a nonresidential
structure shall be considered a new housing unit and shall be
subject to controls on affordability as delineated in Subsection J(1)
and (2) above.
(4) Affordability controls on accessory apartments shall be for a period
of at least 10 years. However, in order to be eligible for a rental
bonus (pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:93-5.13.) controls on affordability
shall extend for a period of 30 years.
(5) Alternative living arrangements shall be controlled in a manner,
suitable to COAH, that provides assurances that such a facility will
house low- and moderate-income households for at least 10 years.
However, in order to be eligible for a rental bonus (pursuant to
N.J.A.C. 5:93-5.14(d)), controls on affordability shall extend for a
period of 30 years.
§ 140-289 WALL CODE § 140-290
139:592
units within a ML Zone District may only be granted after the Planning
Board or Board of Adjustment has received the consent of the Township
Committee. In designing an age-restricted affordable housing project, the
applicant may propose constructing the senior citizen restricted affordable
units in the same building or buildings in order to maximize the potential of
preserving a more tranquil life-style for the senior citizen residents; and to
the foregoing extent, the requirement of integration of the affordable units
with conventional units is modified.
§ 140-291. Bedroom distribution.
§ 140-292. Location and design.
Low- and moderate-income inclusionary housing shall be designed in
accordance with the following provisions:
A. Inclusionary developments that are not age restricted to senior citizens
shall be structured in conjunction with realistic market demands so
that:
(1) The combination of efficiency and one-bedroom units is at least
10% and no greater than 20% of the total low- and moderateincome
units;
(2) At least 30% of all low- and moderate-income units are twobedroom
units; and
(3) At least 20% of all low- and moderate-income units are threebedroom
units.
B. Low and moderate units restricted to senior citizens may utilize a
modified bedroom distribution in accordance with N.J.A.C. 5:93-7.3,
Bedroom Distribution.
C. In the event the Rules of the Council on Affordable Housing shall
provide for a bedroom mix different than the foregoing, the
requirements of COAH shall control and the foregoing shall be deemed
modified for all projects which have not received final site plan
approval.
A. The low- and moderate-income housing units shall be sited on the tract
in locations at least as accessible to common open space and
community facilities as market-priced dwelling units. Rental units may
be concentrated for ownership and management reasons.
B. The exterior design of the low- and moderate-income housing units
shall be harmonious in scale, texture, and materials with the marketpriced
units on the tract.
§ 140-290 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT § 140-293
139:593
§ 140-293. Affirmative marketing plan.
The authority shall provide for the marketing of all low- and moderateincome
housing units developed pursuant to the provisions of this Part
6 in accordance with the provisions of an Affirmative Marketing Plan as
described below:
A. The Affirmative Marketing Plan is a regional marketing strategy
designed to attract buyers and/or renters of all minority and minority

housing. It is a continuing program and covers the period of deed
restriction.
B. Information. The Affirmative Marketing Plan shall include the
information provided in N.J.A.C. 5:93-11.1(b).
C. Marketing program. The advertising component of the marketing

population within the East Central Housing Region (Monmouth, Ocean,
and Mercer Counties). It shall be used in advertising and publicizing
the availability of housing in accordance with the marketing program
requirements of N.J.A.C. 5:93-11.3.
(1) The marketing process for low- and moderate-income units shall
begin at least four months prior to expected occupancy.
(2) In implementing the marketing program, there shall be at least one
paid advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation within the
Housing Region during the first week of the marketing program.
Such advertisement shall include the items specified in N.J.A.C.
5:93-11.3(c).
(3) Applications for low- and moderate-income housing shall be
available in several locations, including, at a minimum, the

the developer's sales office. Applications shall be mailed to
prospective applicants upon request.
(4) If the cost of advertising low- and moderate-income units are to be
a developer's responsibility, the requirement shall be a condition of
the Township Planning Board or Board of Adjustment approval.
D. Marketing for initial sales and/or rental; composition of marketing pool.
(1) Households that apply for low- and moderate-income housing shall
be screened by the authority for preliminary income eligibility by
comparing their total income to the low- and moderate-income
limits adopted by COAH. Applicants shall be notified as to their
eligibility status.
(2) Having screened applicants for preliminary income eligibility, the
authority may analyze the income and household sizes of applicants
§ 140-293 WALL CODE § 140-293
139:594
to determine which applicants have the assets and/or income
necessary to purchase or rent each available low- or moderateincome
unit.
(3) The authority shall interview each applicant and utilize the
procedures outlined in N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.1 to verify the applicant's
income and household size; determine the applicant's asset
availability; and review the applicant's credit history. Applicants
shall be required to submit income verification for each household
member 18 years or older. This process shall be utilized in
establishing the final certified applicant group.
(4) The process described in Subsection D(1) through (3) above may
begin no sooner than one month after the advertising program
outlined in N.J.A.C. 5:93-11.3 begins. Households shall be selected
to proceed through the process described in Subsection D(1)
through (3) above through a method of random selection.
Households shall be certified for low- and moderate-income units
using the procedures outlined in N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.1. The process
described in Subsection D(1) through (3) shall be continued until
all the low- and moderate-income units are occupied.
E. Continuing marketing activities.
(1) The types of activities to be undertaken after the completion of
initial occupancy of sales and rental units in order to fill vacancies
resulting from normal turnover shall include:
(a) Ensuring a sufficient supply of income-eligible applicants by
continuing to implement the marketing plan throughout the
housing region, as outlined in N.J.A.C. 5:93-11.3. At a
minimum, the municipality shall maintain a current pool of at
least five income-eligible applicants for each low- and
moderate-income unit.
(b) Contacting each income-eligible applicant annually to request
updated information regarding income and family size.
(2) As units become available, the authority shall select eligible
applicants for the units, as described in N.J.A.C. 5:93-11.4(b)
through (d), until the units are occupied by low- and moderateincome
households.
F. Monitoring and reporting requirements.
(1) The Township shall collect information on each applicant for lowand
moderate-income housing on forms approved by COAH.

of each applicant of low- and moderate-income housing, as well
as the occupants of the units; and
(c) An evaluation of any necessary adjustments in the affirmative
marketing program as a result of the evaluation in (a) above.
(3) COAH or the Court shall review and assess the effectiveness of the
Township affirmative marketing program. If it is deemed that the
affirmative marketing program is not effective, the Township shall
be required to amend the program.
A. Wall Township will provide an occupancy preference for low- and
moderate-income units created within the Township that responds to
the municipal rehabilitation component.
B. Wall Township will provide an occupancy preference to low- and
moderate-income households that reside or work in the East Central
Housing region (Monmouth, Ocean and Mercer Counties). Such a
preference may apply to all low- and moderate-income units created

[Adopted 11-8-1978 as Sec. 8-3 of the Revised General Ordinances;
amended in its entirety 12-22-2009 by Ord. No. 34-2009]
§ 153-27. Title.
This article shall be known and cited as the "Mobile Home Park Rent
Stabilization Ordinance of the Township of Wall."
§ 153-28. Definitions.
The following definitions shall apply to this article:
AVAILABLE FOR RENT TO TENANTS  Fit for habitation as defined by the
Code, ordinances and regulations in the Township of Wall and occupied or
unoccupied and offered for rent.
CONSUMER PRICE INDEX  Consumer price index, published periodically
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States Department of Labor.
LANDLORD  The mobile home park operator, owner or other person
leasing a mobile home space to a tenant.
MOBILE HOME PARK  Includes any lot or parcel of land and premises
where the owner, lessee, or other person having control thereof shall offer
sites for trailer or mobile homes or similar-type vehicles on a rental or lease
or other basis.
MOBILE HOME SPACE  Includes that portion of a mobile home park
rented, or offered for rent, for the purpose of parking or positioning a trailer
or mobile home for living and dwelling purposes, to one or more individuals
or family units together with all the privileges, services, equipment,
facilities and improvements connected with the use or occupancy of such
portion of the property. Mobile home spaces which are newly constructed
and rented for the first time are exempted from the provisions of this
article, and the initial rent therefor may be determined by the owner. All
subsequent rents will be subject to the provisions of this article. Any mobile
home space occupied by a tenant who is an employee of the landlord and the
rental of which unit is customarily restricted to employees of the landlord
is exempted from the provisions of this article. Where a mobile home space
has been vacant for a period in excess of 12 months, the rent therefor may
be determined by the landlord, and all subsequent rents will be subjected
to the provisions of this article.
PERSON  Any natural person, or any partnership, limited partnership,
joint venture, association or corporation or other entity.
RENT  When used as a noun herein, shall mean the amount of valuable
consideration payable by the tenant to the landlord for the use or occupancy
of a mobile home space, whether or not commonly known as rent, but does
not include those several items set forth more particularly in the definition
of "rental income" hereof.
§ 153-27 MINING § 153-28
150:685
RENTAL INCOME  The payable rent charged and received for the mobile
home space over the previous twelve-month period exclusive of any of the
following: all real property taxes, space fees or license fee charged by the
Township of Wall pursuant to any duly adopted ordinance of the Township
of Wall and any cost of utilities (but only if the same are provided by the
landlord, and then only in an amount equal to the minimum charge(s) for
such service) and all increases for major capital improvements then being
paid by the tenant affected.
UTILITIES  The rate charged for the sewerage or water service.
§ 153-29. Determination of rents.
§ 153-30. Certificates for increase.
A. Establishment of rents between a landlord and a tenant to whom this
article is applicable shall hereafter be determined by the following
provisions: At the expiration of the tenancy for a mobile home space, no
landlord may request or receive any increase in the rental income and
additional charges for that mobile home space from any continuing
tenant, which is greater than a combination of the following:
(1) Any increased cost to the landlord for utilities;
(2) Any increased cost to the landlord in mobile home space fees or
license fee (prorated among all of the tenants residing in the mobile
home park concerned) charged by the Township of Wall pursuant to
any duly adopted ordinance; and
(3) Any amount equal to 8% of the previous twelve-month rental
income for the mobile home space or the percentage increase in
the annual average for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) in the New
York/New Jersey/Connecticut Pennsylvania region for the year
ending December prior to the date of the application for rent
increase, whichever amount shall be less. Any continuing tenant at
the termination of a tenancy shall not suffer or be caused to pay any
rent increase for the mobile home space in any twelve-month
period which exceeds the above permitted increase.
B. This section does not apply to new tenants entering the park for the
first time. Rental rates for new tenants will be established and noted in
the annual application for rent increase. Those new rental rates to be
applied to a new tenant will be the rental rates used by the landlord
until the next application filed with the Rent Board.
C. Replacement of an existing mobile home unit by the existing
homeowner will not cause the rent to increase. The size, type and style
of the mobile home unit must be approved by the landlord. N.J.S.A.
46:8C-2 precludes the landlord from requiring the use of any one
particular manufacturer.
§ 153-28 WALL CODE § 153-30
150:686
A. Rent increases, as authorized by this article, may be allowed only if the
mobile home park substantially complies with the Code of the Township
of Wall pertaining to mobile home and trailer parks and other Township
ordinances. As part of his application for any increase, the landlord
shall submit to the Board written certification that he complies with the
terms and provisions of the aforementioned Township ordinances.
B. Provide to the Board:
(1) Name, address and telephone number of landlord and of his legal
counsel, if any.
(2) Name, address and telephone number of managing agent and
superintendent.
(3) Address of mobile home or trailer units and tenants affected.
(4) Base twelve-month rental figure with reference to which increase
shall be computed.
(5) Calculations of the increases in rent expressed both in terms of
dollars and cents and in terms of percentage increase.
(6) A certification that a copy of the aforesaid notice has been served
upon each tenant named in said notice along with a statement that
the tenant may make application to the Board to review the
proposed rental increase. At the same time that the Board is thus
notified, a copy of said notice shall be mailed by the landlord by
certified mail, return receipt requested, to any tenant who may be
affected by the increase applied for. Adequate proof of said service,
which shall be in affidavit form, shall be filed by the landlord with
the Secretary for the Board.
C. The landlord shall indicate and certify with each application for rent
increase the monthly rent to be charged to any new tenant for the next
year. The Board shall review the application for rent increase for the
rent to be charged to the new tenant and approve or adjust the rate of
that rent. This applies only to new tenants and existing units for their
first 12 months of occupancy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, a park operator or owner shall, on or before January
31 of each year, provide to the Board written notice of the amount
charged during the preceding twelve-month period to any new tenants
that occupy space in that park. This provision is intended to provide
notice to the Board of new rentals and the rents established for those
new occupants.
D. A tenant may be notified by other than certified mail, only if the
landlord or his representative shall serve the tenant personally with the
notice provided for herein, and certify by affidavit the fact of such
service and retain such affidavit in his records to be produced upon
request of the Board. Upon receipt of said notice and where the
increase sought is based upon either § 153-29A(1) or (3), or both as
§ 153-30 MINING § 153-30
150:687
contained hereinbefore in § 153-29, the Board shall schedule a hearing
on said increase, and the landlord shall post in a conspicuous place
in or about the mobile home or trailer park a notice of said hearing
date at least five days prior to the proposed date of hearing. Where the
increase sought is based upon only provision § 153-29A(2) herein, no
hearing shall be scheduled and the increase shall become effective on
the date specified in said notice if all other applicable provisions of this
article are complied with.
E. In order for a landlord to qualify for the vacancy decontrol rent increase
which is permitted under § 153-29B herein, the landlord shall first be
required to file with the Board a written statement signed by the
vacating tenant together with an affidavit signed by the landlord
certifying to the Board that the landlord has not in any way harassed or
pressured the tenant into vacating the mobile home space and that the
vacation of such space was a voluntary act of the tenant. For the
purposes of this article, a vacation caused or necessitated by
substandard, unsafe or unsanitary conditions on the rental premises
shall not be deemed a voluntary vacation. Such noncoercion
certification signed by the tenant shall not be required in order for a
landlord to qualify for the vacancy decontrol rent increase if:
(1) The increase to an incoming tenant does not exceed the total of all
permissible increases authorized by any other provision of this
article; or
(2) The landlord files an affidavit with the Board certifying that the
tenant has moved from the unit without notification to the landlord,
and the landlord has made a good faith effort to obtain a
noncoercion certification from the tenant; or
(3) The landlord files an affidavit that the tenant has vacated the unit
pursuant to a judicially mandated eviction; or
(4) The tenant has refused to sign said certification and, upon appeal
by the landlord, the Board has found that such refusal was
unwarranted and that there was, in fact, no coercion exerted upon
the tenant. A hearing pursuant to this subsection shall be held
before the Board upon the landlord giving at least 15 days' notice to
the vacating tenant by either personal service or by certified mail.
F. Should the Board determine, on the basis of a complaint or information
it has received, and following an investigation or review, that there is
probable cause to conclude that a vacancy resulting in a rental
adjustment or adjustments was obtained on the basis of coercion or
other misconduct by the landlord, the Board shall schedule a hearing on
15 days' written notice to the landlord, in order to consider whether the
adjustment or adjustments should be rolled back as the evidence,
including sworn testimony, shall warrant. If the Board concludes that
the vacancy has resulted from the misconduct of the landlord, the
§ 153-30 WALL CODE § 153-30
150:688
§ 153-31. Timing of increase; excess increase.
Any rental income or additional charge increase at a time other than at
the expiration of a tenancy or termination of a periodic tenancy shall
be void, except where approved by the Board in accordance with the
provisions of this article. Any rental income or additional charge increase
in excess of that authorized by the provisions of this article shall be void.
Periodic tenancy, for the purposes of this section, shall mean a tenancy that
continues from month to month or other recurring period until terminated
by landlord or tenant as provided by law.
§ 153-32. Rent reduction procedure.
A tenant shall be entitled to a rent reduction from a landlord because of
a decrease in real property taxes or utilities or any decrease in the trailer
fees or license fees charged by the Township of Wall. The reduction shall
not exceed that amount authorized by the following provisions:
Board shall void all adjustments and rental charges made under the
provisions of this section retroactive to the date they were imposed.
G. Where the mobile home park or the operator of the mobile home park
fails to substantially comply with this article, any tenant may apply to
the Board for a reasonable reduction in rent, commensurate with any
such noncompliance by the landlord, whereupon the Board shall duly
notify the landlord and schedule the matter for a public hearing and,
the landlord shall effect service of notice of said meeting in accordance
with the provisions of the preceding subsection. If, as a result of such a
hearing, a reasonable reduction in rent is granted, it shall remain in
effect until the landlord proves that the noncompliance determined by
the Board to exist has been corrected. If the Board determines that the
noncompliance affects a majority of the home sites, the rent reduction
may be extended to include all of the tenants in the mobile home park.
A. Where the decrease consists of a decrease in the municipal property tax
due to aid received from the state aid for schools fund and where said
decrease is subject to the provisions of Chapter 63, P.L. 1976 (N.J.S.A.
54:4-6.2 et seq.), as may be amended from time to time, the landlord
shall make such rebate and upon such terms as Chapter 63, P.L. 1976,
provides.
B. Where the decrease consists of a decrease in the real property taxes
other than that decrease provided for in Subsection A above, the
landlord shall divide the decrease in the present tax over the tax for the
previous year by the total number of occupied mobile home spaces in
the mobile home park. The decrease each tenant is entitled to shall be a
credit to rent in 12 monthly installments commencing from July 1 of
each year. Any tenant entitled to a rent decrease hereunder shall be
notified by the landlord by certified mail of the calculations involved in
computing such reduction and the effective date of such reduction.
§ 153-30 MINING § 153-32
150:689
§ 153-33. Tax surcharge.
A landlord shall be entitled to a rent surcharge for any increase in real
property taxes. Any landlord seeking a surcharge for real property taxes
shall notify the tenants by certified mail at least 30 days prior to the date of
which said increase is to be effective of the calculations involved, including
the property tax for the mobile home park for the previous year, and the
increase in the present tax over the tax for the previous year divided by
the total number of occupied mobile home spaces in the mobile home park.
The tax surcharge each tenant is liable for shall be paid in 12 monthly
installments commencing July 1 of each year.
§ 153-34. Tax appeals.
§ 153-35. Additional rent increases.
C. Where the decrease consists of a decrease in utilities, trailer fees or
license fees, the landlord shall divide the decrease in the present
utilities, trailer fees or license fees over the utilities, trailer or license
fees of the previous year by the total number of occupied mobile home
spaces in the mobile home park to obtain the decrease per space. The
decrease each tenant is entitled to shall be a credit to rent on 12
monthly installments commencing from the effective date of said
reduction. Any tenant entitled to a rent decrease hereunder shall be
notified by the landlord by certified mail of the calculations involved in
computing such reduction and the effective date of such reduction.
A. In the event a real property tax appeal is taken by the landlord and the
landlord is successful in said appeal and the taxes reduced, the tenants
involved shall, for the tax year concerned, receive 25% of said reduction
after the landlord's costs of securing said tax reduction have been
deducted. The landlord shall receive the remaining benefit of the
reduced taxes. Thereafter, in succeeding years, the benefit of such
successful tax appeal shall be divided evenly between the tenants and
the landlord.
B. Any such successful landlord shall notify the tenants by certified mail
within 30 days after the receipt of the final judgment of the calculations
involved, including an itemization of the costs of securing said
reduction and the reduction each tenant is entitled to, which reduction
shall be determined by multiplying .25 times the difference between the
amount of said reduction and the landlord's costs of securing said
reduction and dividing the amount thus obtained by the total number of
occupied mobile home spaces in the mobile home park.
A. Hardship.
(1) A landlord who finds that present rental income and additional
charges from the mobile home park on which he seeks relief
hereunder are insufficient to cover the cost of payments on a first
mortgage and any subsequent mortgages directly used to improve
§ 153-32 WALL CODE § 153-35
150:690
and upgrade the mobile home park and/or payments for
maintenance and/or all operating costs and/or provide said
landlord with a just and reasonable return on his investment, may
apply to the Board for an increase in rental income. Said
application shall separately set forth the amount of mortgage
payments, taxes, insurance, routine maintenance costs, other fixed
expenses associated with the operations of the mobile home park,
the rent being charged for each mobile home space located in
the park, the deficiency allocable to each mobile home space, a
factual computation of the just and reasonable return desired by
the landlord, together with such other information as the landlord
believes will support his application. Following a hearing, the
Board may grant the landlord a hardship rent increase to meet
these needs after considering the proofs presented by the landlord,
the condition of the mobile home park and the degree of hardship
to the landlord.
(2) Prior to any such application to the Board, a landlord must post in a
conspicuous place in and about the mobile home park a notice of
said application setting forth the basis for said application; each
tenant to be affected must, at the same time, receive a copy of the
application by certified mail or by personal service. The landlord
must thereafter notify each affected tenant of the appeal hearing
date by certified mail or by personal service and in addition
thereto, post a notice in a conspicuous place at the mobile home
park for at least five days prior to the application hearing date.
B. Major capital improvements. A landlord may seek an additional charge
for major capital improvements. Capital improvements shall be an item
considered as such under federal Internal Revenue code enactments
and regulations. Prior to filing an application with the Board, the
landlord must notify by certified mail or by personal service each tenant
residing in the mobile home park affected of the total cost of the
completed capital improvement, the number of years of useful life of the
improvement as claimed by the landlord for purposes of depreciation
for income tax purposes, the average cost, including debt service, of the
improvement (calculated by dividing the cost of the major improvement
by the total number of mobile home spaces in the mobile home park),
and the capital improvement surcharge he is seeking from each tenant.
The landlord seeking a capital improvement surcharge shall apply to
the Board for said surcharge. The Board shall determine, after the
landlord has provided notice to the affected tenants by certified mail or
by personal service of said hearing at least five days prior thereto, if
said improvement is a major capital improvement. If the Board
determines that said improvement is a major capital improvement, the
Board shall permit such increase to take place and indicate any
conditions to be attached thereto. In any event, no increase granted by
authority of this subsection shall exceed 15% of the annual rental
income paid by each tenant, unless said increase or capital
improvement is mandated by law. Any tenant of a mobile home park
§ 153-35 MINING § 153-35
150:691
§ 153-36. Mobile Home Rent Stabilization and Control Board.
may determine to pay the capital improvement surcharge in one lump
sum, provided that the landlord agrees to waive recovery of all
financing charges associated with the capital improvement surcharge
on such tenant's rental space. For purposes of this subsection, the
pumping of a septic tank or the performance of any maintenance
function with respect to a septic tank, or the topping or trimming of
trees shall not be considered a major capital improvement. However,
on notice to all affected tenants and after a public hearing, the Board
may approve a surcharge for the cost of pumping of a septic system
servicing a mobile home park upon all affected tenants of that park;
provided, however, that evidence is furnished to the Board's satisfaction
that the septic system has been inspected and approved for continued
use by the Monmouth County Board of Health, said inspection to be
completed within 60 days of the date of pumping of the septic tank
affected.
C. Recycling costs. A landlord may seek an additional charge for the cost
of recycling. Recycling costs shall mean an additional charge that the
landlord must pay beside the current charge for trash disposal, less any
credit or refund for recycling such materials. Any application for an
increase under this section must comply with Subsection A of this
section.73
A. Board created. There is hereby created a Mobile Home Rent
Stabilization and Control Board within the Township of Wall. The Board
shall consist of five regular members all of whom shall be residents of
the Township of Wall. All members shall be appointed by the Township
Committee and shall serve, commencing with their initial appointment,
terms of one year, two years, three years, four years, and five years,
respectively, and thereafter terms of five years or until prior expiration
of this article, whichever event shall first occur. Each of the said terms
shall be deemed to commence on the first day of January of the year of
their respective appointments. There shall be two alternates appointed
annually by the Township Committee to serve in the absence or
disqualification of a regular member of the Board. Vacancies shall be
filled for the balance of the unexpired term. Members shall not hold any
other elective office or position in the Township. The members of the
Board shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for
reasonable and necessary expenses. The Board shall have available to it
such clerical assistance and legal counsel as is budgeted annually by
the Township Committee. No member shall vote upon or enter into
discussions as to any matter in which he or she has a direct or indirect
interest, financial or otherwise.
B. A member of the Board may be removed for cause, upon written
charges brought before the Township Committee and served upon said

recommendation. If the Municipal Clerk accepts the recommendation
of the Chief of Police to deny any license, the applicant shall be notified
in writing within 10 days of such denial and the Clerk shall forward to
the applicant a statement of the reason or reasons for such denial.
D. Grounds for recommending denial of license may include reliable
information indicating that the applicant has in the past engaged in

officers or employees of any crime(s), disorderly persons offense(s) in

inspection of any authorized police officer or any sworn law
enforcement officer acting in the performance of his or her duty as set

computer equipment, and using the electronic format approved by the
Chief of Police, every dealer shall enter all reportable transactions into
the electronic database by the end of the close of business on the same
date as the purchase or receipt of property for pawn or consignment.
The information entered must contain all pertinent information outlined
in Subsection C, above.

responsible to enter all transaction information set forth in Subsection
C above into the database as soon as possible upon the dealer's
equipment being repaired or replaced or the database coming back into
service. Failure by the dealer to properly maintain computer equipment
in a reasonable fashion or failure by the dealer to replace faulty
computer equipment may result in the dealer being cited for a violation
of this chapter and subsequently being subject to the penalties for
doing so including revocation of the dealer's license as described in

jurisdiction should charge the seller with theft by deception under
N.J.S.A. 2C:20-4 on behalf of the dealer, who shall be considered the
victim of the offense for the purposes of N.J.S.A. 2C:43-3. The officer
shall seize the goods, provide the dealer with a receipt, and issue a
criminal complaint against the seller for theft by deception and any
other criminal charges for which the officer has probable cause that the
seller has committed. If convicted of theft by deception and if so found

for providing restitution to the dealer under N.J.S.A. 2C:44-2 for the
amount paid by the dealer to the seller for the stolen goods.

empowered to temporarily suspend for cause any dealer's license and
rights to operate thereunder. This penalty shall be in addition to any
fines and penalties the dealer may incur pursuant to § 169-8 of this
chapter.
(1) Grounds for suspension. The following shall constitute grounds for
suspension: violation of any provisions of this chapter, including

150:721
violation of any other statute, regulation, or local ordinance; or any
other illegal, improper, or fraudulent activity.
(2) Procedure for suspension. Upon determination that appropriate
grounds exist and that a suspension is warranted, the Chief of
Police or a designee thereof shall issue a written notice of
suspension of license to the offending dealer and to the Municipal
Clerk, which shall set forth the grounds for the suspension and
notify the dealer of his or her right to appeal pursuant to
Subsection G. A temporary suspension shall issue immediately,

immediately cease engaging in the business of purchasing for
resale, receiving for pawn, and/or selling of precious metals and/or
other secondhand goods in the municipality until reinstatement.
(3) Reinstatement. Suspended dealers may be reinstated only when
the grounds leading to the suspension have, in the determination of
the Township Attorney, or other official designated by the Township
Attorney to review the grounds for suspension, been cured,
corrected, or appropriately rectified.
F. Revocation. A license issued under this chapter may be revoked by the
Municipal Clerk upon written recommendation from the Chief of Police
or the Chief's designee that the dealer is no longer qualified, capable or
competent to comply with the requirements of this chapter. This penalty
shall be in addition to any fines and penalties the dealer may incur
under § 169-8.

grounds exist and that a revocation is warranted, the Chief of
Police or the Chief's designee shall so report to the Municipal Clerk
in writing. A temporary suspension will immediately and
automatically issue, if one is not already in effect, pending the
outcome of the charge. The Township Attorney, or other official
designated by the Township Attorney, shall review the stated
grounds for revocation and shall issue an appropriate disposition of
either suspension, revocation, or reinstatement. If it is determined
that revocation is the appropriate disposition, the grounds therefor
shall be set forth in writing in the form of a notice of revocation,

§ 191-3. Preparation for collection.
A. Garbage. Garbage shall only be placed in the containers provided by
the Township of Wall for that purpose. Each eligible residential property
shall receive an initial container from the Township at no cost for use
with solid waste disposal. The property owner shall have a choice of
three container sizes which shall be 96 gallons, 64 gallons, or 48
gallons. Each property owner may "purchase" up to two additional
household trash containers from the Township. Requests for additional
containers shall result in the economizing of sizes as to maximize the
efficiency of the collection program. For example, a resident with a
current forty-eight-gallon container that requests a second shall receive
a ninety-six-gallon container in place of those two containers resulting
in one garbage container to be "tipped" each week as opposed to two.
Exceptions to this policy shall only be made in cases where there exists
a proven hardship or limitation that requires multiple smaller-sized
cans. Once the container(s) is placed at the property by the Township,
any changes in size shall be at the cost of the property owner unless the
Township can accommodate a swap with another returned container.
[Amended 12-23-2014 by Ord. No. 29-2014]
(1) Placement. Each container shall be placed near the roadway at the
curb or near the edge of the pavement free of obstructions with the
wheels and hinge facing toward the house in order accommodate
the orderly collection of debris as designed. No bags or trash
should be placed outside of the container. Garbage shall be
thoroughly and completely drained of all liquids and placed in the
containers hereinbefore set forth. The Township shall collect no
more than three household trash containers from any separate
residence. No containers shall be placed for collection prior to
sunset of the evening before the scheduled collection day, nor shall
containers remain at the roadside later than 9:00 p.m. the day they
are collected.
(2) Ownership. All containers shall remain the property of the
Township of Wall regardless of whether the container was an
initially provided container at no cost to the property or if it was an
additional purchased container. For the purposes of this section,
the term "purchase" shall be interpreted to mean a perpetual lease
between the Township, the property, and the property owner. For
clarity of this interpretation, the initial container provided by the
§ 191-2 WALL CODE § 191-3
188:752
Township shall remain with the property when ownership of the
property changes. Any additional containers that may have been
"purchased" by an owner shall remain with the owner if said owner
acquires or moves to a different eligible property within Wall
Township. In the event that a resident owner ceases domicile of an
eligible property, all additionally "purchased" containers shall be
returned to or collected by the Department of Public Works.
(3) Newly constructed residential eligible property. Each newly
constructed residential property within the Township of Wall shall
be issued an initial garbage container, at no cost, upon the
provision of a copy of the temporary certificate of occupancy.
(4) Maintenance. The Township of Wall will provide maintenance to the
Township containers at no cost to the residents. In the unlikely
event that the can is damaged due to misuse or abuse by the
resident, it will be the resident's responsibility to pay for the
necessary repairs or replacement of the container. If a container is
lost or stolen, it is the resident's responsibility to pay for a
replacement container.
B. Single-stream recycling. Single-stream recycling shall only be placed in
the containers provided by the Township of Wall for that purpose. This
Township-issued container shall be clearly distinguishable from the
container provided for household trash collection. Each eligible
residential property shall receive an initial container from the Township
at no cost for use with the single-stream recycling program. The
property owner shall have a choice of three container sizes which shall
be 96 gallons, 64 gallons or 48 gallons. Each property owner may
"purchase" up to two additional household recycling containers from
the Township. Requests for additional containers shall result in the
economizing of sizes as to maximize the efficiency of the collection
program. For example, a resident with a current forty-eight-gallon
container that requests a second shall receive a ninety-six-gallon
container in place of those two containers resulting in one garbage
container to be "tipped" each week as opposed to two. Exceptions to
this policy shall only be made in cases where there exists a proven
hardship or limitation that requires multiple smaller-sized cans. Once
the container(s) is placed at the property by the Township, any changes
in size shall be at the cost of the property owner unless the Township
can accommodate a swap with another returned container. Material to
be placed in the single-stream recycling container includes: cardboard,
newspaper, plastic bottles, glass jars, magazines, etc. Single-stream
recycling material must go directly into the container, trash bags in
these containers are not acceptable. Each container shall be placed in a
position by the curbline free of obstructions to the collection system
operating as designed. The Township shall collect no more than three
household trash containers from any separate residence. [Amended
12-23-2014 by Ord. No. 29-2014]
§ 191-3 SOIL REMOVAL § 191-3
188:753
(1) Placement. Each container shall be placed near the roadway at the
curb or near the edge of the pavement free of obstructions with the
wheels and hinge facing toward the house in order to accommodate
the orderly collection of debris as designed. No recyclables should
be placed outside of the container. Recycling material shall be
thoroughly and completely drained of all liquids and placed in the
containers hereinbefore set forth. The Township shall collect no
more than three household recycling containers from any separate
residence. No containers shall be placed for collection prior to
sunset of the evening before the scheduled collection day, nor shall
containers remain at the roadside later than 9:00 p.m. the day they
are collected.
(2) Ownership. All containers shall remain the property of the
Township of Wall regardless of whether the container was an
initially provided container at no cost to the property or if it was an
additional purchased container. For the purposes of this section,
the term "purchase" shall be interpreted to mean a perpetual lease
between the Township, the property, and the property owner. For
clarity of this interpretation, the initial container provided by the
Township shall remain with the property when ownership of the
property changes. Any additional containers that may have been
"purchased" by an owner shall remain with the owner if said owner
acquires or moves to a different eligible property within Wall
Township. In the event that a resident owner ceases domicile of an

through taxation is borne by a property owner not receiving the
additional container.
(3) In order to encourage residential recycling, the Township will
reduce the cost of the first additional recycling container by 50%.
Such reduction shall be reflected in the approved resolution of the
Township Committee adopted to establish the fees for the
acquisition of additional containers by eligible Township residents/
property owners.

Separation and Collection of Recyclable Materials
[Adopted 5-12-2010 by Ord. No. 4-201075]
§ 191-10. Purpose; legislative authority.
Proper management of solid waste is an important matter of public health
and safety. The source separation and recovery of certain recyclable
materials will serve the public interest by conserving energy and natural
resources and reducing waste disposal expenses. In accordance with the
requirements of the New Jersey Mandatory Source Separation and
Recycling Act (N.J.S.A. 13:1E-99.11 et seq.) and the 2009 update to the
Monmouth County Solid Waste Management Plan, it is therefore necessary
to update and amend existing municipal rules and regulations for the
separation, storage, collection and recovery of designated recyclable
materials.
§ 191-11. Source separation required.
It shall be mandatory for all persons who are owners, lessees and occupants
of residential property, of business and industrial properties, and of private
or public and government institutions and buildings to separate newspaper,
corrugated cardboard, clean mixed paper, aluminum cans, tin and bimetal
cans, glass bottles and jars, and pourable plastic bottles ("designated
recyclables") from all other solid waste produced by such residences and
establishments for the separate collection and ultimate recycling of such
materials.
§ 191-12. Provision and labeling of recycling containers.
§ 191-13. Residential and public institutional single-stream
recycling. [Amended 12-23-2014 by Ord. No. 29-2014]
A. All apartment and other multifamily complexes, businesses, schools and
other public or private institutions shall provide separate and clearly
marked containers for trash and the various types of recyclables, as
appropriate, for use by residents, students, employees, customers or
other visitors.
B. Any company or agency providing dumpsters or roll-off or other
containers to any apartment or other multifamily complex with shared
disposal and recycling areas or to any business, school or other
institution or for any construction/demolition project shall clearly mark
such container for trash or for single-stream recycling as may be
appropriate. [Amended 12-23-2014 by Ord. No. 29-2014]
A. Definitions. As used in this article, the following terms shall have the

stream, both the collection and processing systems are designed to
handle this fully commingled mixture of recyclables, with materials
being separated for reuse at a materials recovery facility.
B. Residences, businesses and institutions provided with recyclables
collection service by municipal forces or through municipal contract
shall place all designated recyclables in the appropriate containers at
curbside or other area(s) in the manner and according to the schedule

collection services, including the size, number and location of storage
containers, frequency of pickup service, the name and address of any
contractor hired to provide such service, and phone and other contact
information for the contractor.
E. Leaves shall be kept separate from other vegetative waste and shall
only be placed for collection in the manner and according to the
schedule as shall be published and distributed by the municipality.

establishment from making arrangements to collect leaves and grass
directly from his, her or its property through his, her or its own efforts.
F. The following bulky recyclables shall not be placed with solid waste at
the curbside or in containers provided for waste collection and

vehicles out of gas, flat tires, etc.
WINCHING  The process of moving a motor vehicle by the use of a cable
from a position that is not accessible for direct hook up by conventional
means for loading onto a tow vehicle. Winching is not pulling a vehicle into
a tilt bed or carrier, nor lifting a motor vehicle with a conventional tow sling.

building or structure may apply for a mandatory connection waiver
based upon extraordinary circumstances, where a mandatory
connection would require a stream or wetlands crossing or there
exists another similar environmental condition requiring extensive
regulatory permits from the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection or other county or state regulatory
agencies.
B. No waiver from the mandatory sewer connection requirement shall be
granted by the Township Committee unless the property in question
contains an individual sewerage disposal system which is operational
and may continue to operate in compliance with all applicable local,
county and state health codes or other regulations.
C. The grant of a waiver from a mandatory sewer connection requirement
by the Township Committee shall not affect in any way the obligation of
the property owner to pay any applicable sewer assessment levied
against the property in question.
