owners of the project, including the _inancing of the project. Such a contract may be entered into before
the acquisition of any real property necessary to the project by the city or the developer or other parties.
Sec. 8.22. Property acquisi_on.
An economic development project may be constructed on property acquired by the developer or developers,
or on property directly acquired by the city, or on property acquired by the redevelopment commission or its
successors while exercising the powers, duties and responsibilities pursuant to G.S. 160A-500 et seq.
Sec. 8.23. Property disposi_on.
In connection with an economic development project, the city may convey interests in property owned by it,
including air rights over public facilities, as follows:
1. If the property was acquired under G.S. 160A-500 et seq., the property interests may be conveyed in
accordance with special or general law. For these purposes:
a. G.S. 160A-514(e) is amended by adding the following new subdivision:
"(5) After a public hearing advertised in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 160A-513(e) and
subject to the approval of the governing body of the municipality, the commission may determine that
in the best interest of the municipality certain property should be developed for one purpose only,
which purpose shall be designated. The commission shall advertise such property and designated
purpose, and shall invite redevelopment proposals by public notice, by publication once a week for two
(2) consecutive weeks in a newspaper having general circulation in the municipality, and shall make
available all pertinent information to any persons interested in undertaking a purchase of such
property and the redevelopment of such property or any part thereof. Any property sold in accordance
with this subsection shall be sold at public auction to the highest bidder for cash at a price not less
than the fair market value thereof, as _ixed by the commission. All conveyances made under the
authority of this subsection shall contain restrictive covenants limiting the use of property so conveyed
to the designated purpose for which the conveyance is made."
b. G.S. 160A-514(d) is amended by inserting the following at the end:
"Regardless of the preceding provisions, the commission may reject the highest responsible bid and
accept a lesser bid where it makes the following speci_ic _indings and where such _indings are veri_ied
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 58/938
and approved by the governing body of the municipality after a public hearing advertised in
accordance with the provisions of G.S. 160A-513: The general public welfare and proper development
of the community will be better served by the bid which was accepted than by the higher bid or bids
where were rejected, for one or more of the following reasons:
1. The proposed use or development of the land under the successful bid will result in an assessed
valuation for ad valorem taxation greater than that of the use or uses proposed by the higher
bidders;
2. The proposed use or development of the land under the successful bid will have a substantially
greater bene_icial effect upon neighboring property, the project area, and the community as a whole
than the use or uses proposed by the highest bidders and will tend to induce greater investment in
the development of other property in the area;
3. The proposed use or development of the land under the successful bid will facilitate the relocation
of families where required by law to a substantially greater degree than the use or uses proposed by
the higher bidders."
c. G.S. 160A-514(d) is amended by inserting the following clause between the word "section" and the
word "provided" in line 16:
"or to a developer under the special circumstances set forth in subdivision (6) of subsection (e)."
d. Convey at private sale to any other redeveloper particular properties within a redevelopment area
where it _inds the proposed redeveloper is the only known available, quali_ied and willing redeveloper
for the contemplated use and makes one or more of the following _indings and all such _indings are
veri_ied and approved by the governing body of the municipality after a public hearing, notice of which
shall be given once a week for two (2) successive calendar weeks in a newspaper published in the
municipality, said notice to be published the _irst time, not less than _ifteen (15) days prior to the date
_ixed for said hearing:
a. that the proposed use or redevelopment is necessary in order to facilitate the relocation of families
where required by law;
b. that the proposed use or redevelopment is reasonably necessary in order to assure development
which will have the desired bene_icial effect upon neighboring property, the project area and the
community as a whole, as contemplated by the redevelopment plan;
c. that the proposed use or redevelopment will assure that the property will not remain unused for an
unduly long period and will result in a return to the local ad valorem rolls at a substantially earlier
date than uses or redevelopment obtainable by other methods of disposition.
Such conveyance shall be for such consideration as may be agreed upon by the commission and the
redeveloper and approved by the governing body of the municipality, which shall not be less than the
fair, actual value of the property as determined by the commission and by the governing body of the
municipality, based on competent evidence."
2. If the property was acquired by the city directly, the city may convey property interests by (i) any
procedure set forth in its City Charter, special act or the general law, or (ii) by private negotiation or sale.
Sec. 8.24. Construc_on of the project.
A contract between the city and the developer or developers may provide that the developer or developers
shall be responsible for the construction of the entire economic development project. If so, the contract shall
include such provisions as the city council deems suf_icient to assure that any public facilities included in the
project meet the needs of the city and are constructed at a reasonable price. Any funds loaned by the city,
pursuant to this paragraph, to a private developer, and used by said developer in the construction of a project
on private property shall not be deemed an expenditure of public funds.
Sec. 8.25. Opera_on.
The city may contract for the operation of any public facility or facilities included in an economic
development project by a person, partnership, _irm or corporation, public or private. In addition, the city,
upon consideration, may contract through lease or otherwise whereby it may operate privately constructed

parking facilities to serve the general public. Such a contract shall include provisions suf_icient to assure that
any such facility or facilities are operated for the bene_it of the citizens of the city.
Sec. 8.26. G.S. 160A-516 amended.
G.S. 160A-516 is amended by adding a new subsection (g) to read:
g. The redevelopment commission is authorized to issue notes or other evidence of indebtedness to a bank
or other private lending source for any purpose for which bonds may be issued and sold under this
Article. The redevelopment commission shall also have full power and authority to determine the terms
of payment, including interest rates, and the security to be issued, if any, by the redevelopment
commission to secure the notes or other evidences of indebtedness.

of_icial of the city and either served directly on the violator or his duly designated agent, or registered
agent if a corporation, in person or posted in the United States mail service by _irst class mail addressed
to the last known address of the violator as contained in the records of the county, or obtained from the

the citation is issued must have been corrected by the time the citation is paid; otherwise, further
citations shall be issued. Citations may be issued for each day the offense continues until the prohibited

and stating an expected issuance date. The advisory opinion will be issued to the person who requests

are apparent.
5. The ethics commission's designee must notify the person who is the subject of the complaint no more
than three business days from the day the complaint was _iled. The noti_ication shall include a copy of
the full complaint and a copy of any portion of the code of ethics that may have been or that may be
violated.
6. The ethics commission designee shall provide the subject of the complaint with a copy of the complaint
before it provides copies to any other parties.

days from the date a complaint is _iled. If the complaint is preliminarily deemed to fall within the
purview of the ethics commission, (i) it shall be placed upon the agenda of the next regularly scheduled
meeting of the ethics commission or (ii) if it has been _iled within _ive business days of the next
regularly scheduled meeting of the ethics commission, then complaint shall be placed on the agenda
for the regularly scheduled meeting following the month the complaint is _iled. If the subject matter of
the complaint appears to be a violation of a criminal statute, the matter shall be referred to the
appropriate law enforcement agency or the district attorney.
8. The ethics commission may immediately dismiss a complaint at any time if:
a. The ethics commission has no jurisdiction over the subject matter or the alleged violator;

c. The alleged violation is de minimis;
d. The complaint is, on its face, frivolous, groundless, or brought for purposes of harassment;
e. The matter has become moot because the person who is the subject of the complaint is no longer an
of_icial or employee. If the ethics commission determines that the public interest would be served
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 84/938
by publishing an advisory opinion, it shall subsequently issue an opinion.
f. The person who is the subject of the complaint had obtained an advisory opinion under section 2-
95 permitting the conduct; or
g. The ethics commission deems the supervisor, department head, city manager, or personnel review
board has already dealt satisfactorily with the alleged ethics violation which is the subject of the
complaint and was a part of a previously decided employee disciplinary matter.
h. All dismissals shall be in writing, contain the reason for the dismissal, and be made available to the
public.
9. If, after initial review by the ethics commission, the complaint has not been dismissed pursuant to
subsection 2-95(i)(8), the commission shall prepare and issue a notice of hearing, which shall set forth
in reasonable detail the alleged violations of the code of ethics and the facts supporting the allegations.
The notice of hearing shall be mailed to the person _iling the complaint (complainant) and to the
subject of the complaint (complaint subject) within _ive days of its approval by the chair of the ethics
commission. The notice shall provide the complaint subject an opportunity to prepare and _ile an
answer to the notice of hearing within ten days, unless an extension is granted for good cause. When
received by the ethics commission, the answer shall be promptly mailed to the complainant.
10. Within ten days of the receipt of the answer, the city clerk shall issue a notice setting forth a date and
place for the hearing. The ethics commission will attempt to accommodate the parties in selecting a
date that is mutually agreeable.

enforcement agency when credible evidence of a crime is discovered.
12. At least ten days before the hearing, the parties or their representatives shall submit to the ethics
commission a proposed list of witnesses and a list of possible documentary evidence to be introduced
at the hearing, as well as an estimate of the length of time needed to present the testimony and
evidence.
13. The ethics commission may request its attorney to subpoena witnesses and documents after having
made a written request to appear or provide the records. Subpoenas shall be issued pursuant to North
Carolina State Law. Persons who are subpoenaed or whose records are subpoenaed may object to
testimony or the production of documents on the grounds that such information is privileged under
North Carolina State Law.
14. Any elected or appointed of_icial or employee of the City of Fayetteville who is called before the ethics
commission for a hearing shall be required to participate in providing information that is in their
custody unless such information is protected by a privilege under North Carolina State Law.
15. After the notice of hearing has been issued, none of the parties or their representatives may
communicate with the ethics commission or any ethics commission member on any matter pertaining
to the inquiry. All communications pertaining to the inquiry shall be sent to the commission's attorney.
16. At any time after the issuance of the notice of hearing, the ethics commission, at its discretion, may
make a _inding solely on the basis of written arguments without holding a public hearing if it

have the right to demand a hearing which may be open to the public.
17. At any time after the issuance of the notice of hearing, the ethics commission may dismiss a complaint
without a _inding for or against the complaint subject if it _inds that the person committed the violation
due to oversight and comes into voluntary compliance.
18. The ethics commission may dismiss a complaint if the complainant does not appear at the hearing and
if, in the opinion of the ethics commission, it would be unfair to the subject of the complaint not to have
the opportunity to examine the complainant. Nothing herein shall prevent the ethics commission from
conducting the hearing where there is reason to believe that the code of ethics has been violated.

to make an opening statement and presentation of the evidence in support of the allegations set forth

subject of the complaint or their representative shall have the opportunity to make an opening
statement and present evidence. The complainant or their representative shall have the opportunity to
cross-examine witnesses called by the complaint subject. Either party shall be allowed suf_icient time
to examine and respond to any evidence not presented to them in advance of the hearing. At the
conclusion of the evidence, the parties may make closing statements or, with the consent of the ethics
commission, submit written summaries of their respective positions.
21. The chair of the ethics commission and, in the absence of the chair, the vice chair shall preside at the
hearing, administer oaths or accept af_irmations from witnesses, and decide all points of order,
procedure and evidence. The hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules of evidence,
and any relevant evidence, including hearsay, of probative value shall be admitted at the discretion of
the chair. Incompetent, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded.
22. An electronic or stenographic record of the hearing shall be made and kept by the city clerk.
23. At the conclusion of the hearing, the ethics commission shall deliberate towards a decision. Upon a
majority vote of the members present for the hearing, the matter shall be decided. The ethics
commission shall then direct its attorney to draft _indings, conclusions and recommendations for
approval at the following regularly scheduled meeting.
24. The ethics commission shall conduct a hearing of all complaints within 90 days of receipt of the
complaint by the ethics commission. Procedural delays caused by the subject of the inquiry shall toll
the 90-day time limit.
25. Within 30 days of the conclusion of deliberations, the ethics commission shall issue and publish its
decision to include _indings, conclusions and recommendations. In the alternative, the ethics
commission where it deems appropriate may issue an advisory opinion in lieu of making _indings and
recommendations.
26. The commission's attorney shall send a written copy of the ethics commission's _indings and
recommendations to the inquiry subject and the complainant and, unless provided otherwise in these
rules, in the code of ethics, or in state law, shall make the _indings and recommendations public.
27. The complaint subject shall have the right to be represented by legal counsel in the hearing or any
other proceeding, before the ethics commission.

by the city's internal auditor and certify that they have read the City of Fayetteville Code of Ethics.

North Carolina Constitution, or the Constitution of the United States, those provisions will control.

Sec. 2-121. Regula_on of Smoking on city property and in city vehicles.
a. Purpose and intent. Numerous reliable studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor
to indoor air pollution and have shown that breathing side-stream or secondhand smoke is a
signi_icant health hazard to nonsmokers. The Surgeon General of the United States has concluded that
involuntary or passive smoking is the cause of disease, including lung cancer, in healthy nonsmokers
and had estimated that involuntary smoking causes more deaths, approximately 5,000 per year, than
all other airborne pollutants combined, excluding asbestos. The city council recognizes the increasing
evidence that smoke creates a danger to the health of some citizens (especially children and the
elderly) and is a cause of annoyance and physical discomfort to those who are in con_ined spaces
where smoke is present. The city council also recognizes that research indicates that during active
smoking outdoor, levels of secondhand smoke may be as high as indoor levels and may pose a health
risk for people in close proximity. The purpose and intent of this section is to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare by prohibiting smoking within all city leased or owned property
(including both buildings and grounds) and vehicles.
b. De_initions. The following terms, words, and phrases used in this section are de_ined as follows:
1. City property shall mean any building, structure, parcel, enclosed area, or other real estate, in its
entirety (including all adjacent unenclosed grounds), that is (1) owned; (2) leased as lessor; or (3)
leased as lessee and occupied, operated, maintained, or managed, directly or indirectly, by the city.
For purposes of this section, this de_inition expressly excludes the grounds (unenclosed areas) of
parks and recreation facilities and the grounds (both enclosed and unenclosed areas) of the
Fayetteville Regional Airport, and expressly includes all enclosed areas of parks and recreation
facilities.
2. City vehicles shall mean a vehicle owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by the city, including
vehicles assigned permanently or temporarily by the city to an employee(s), agency, institution, or
facility or other entity for of_icial city business.
3. Employee shall mean a person who is employed by the City of Fayetteville, or who contracts with
the city or a third person to perform services for the city, or who otherwise performs services for
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 87/938
the city with or without compensation.
4. Enclosed area shall mean an area with a roof or other overhead covering of any kind. Enclosed areas
include, but are not limited to, swimming pools, swimming pool complexes, shelters, and similar
structures.

or indirectly, by the city.

_ields, tennis court, basketball court, playground, gym, athletic complex, swimming pool, or other
real estate that is designed for recreational use and owned, leased, operated, maintained, or
managed, directly or indirectly, by the Fayetteville-Cumberland Parks and Recreation
Department.
7. Smoke or smoking shall refer to:
a. The lighting of, emitting of, or exhaling of the smoke of a pipe, cigar, or cigarette of any kind
and/or any similar products.
b. The possession of any burning tobacco, weed, other plant product, and/or any similar products;
or
c. The carrying or holding of a lighted pipe, cigar, or cigarette of any kind or any other lighted
smoking equipment or device;
c. Smoking prohibited on city property and in city vehicles. Smoking is prohibited on all city property
except the grounds of parks and recreation facilities as de_ined herein. The grounds of each parks and
recreation facility shall have at least one clearly and conspicuously marked area designated for
smoking. No designated smoking area may be located less than 50 feet from any ball _ield, tennis
court, basketball court, playground, or public entrances to structures of any kind (including swimming
pools or swimming pool complexes). The Fayetteville-Cumberland Parks and Recreation Department
may in its discretion designate additional appropriate smoking areas, not to exceed three areas total,
on the grounds of any single facility.
d. Posting of Signs Required. “No smoking” with letters not less than one inch in height or the
international “no smoking” symbol (consisting of a pictorial representation of a burning cigarette
enclosed in a red circle with a red bar across it) shall be posted in every public building or other place
(including grounds and vehicles) where smoking is prohibited or regulated by this section, by the
public of_icial having control of such building or other place.
1. For vehicles, the signs must be displayed in areas where passengers will be able to see the signs, but
the placement of the signs must not interfere with the safe operation of the vehicle.
2. For areas on the grounds of parks and recreation facilities where smoking is permitted, signs
designating these smoking areas shall also be posted. The Fayetteville- Cumberland Parks and
Recreation Department is authorized to recommend additional signs, subject to approval by the city
manager or his designee, to regulate smoking on the grounds of parks and recreation facilities in a
manner consistent with this section.
3. Nothing in this section prohibits a person in charge of city property (buildings, grounds, and
vehicles) from posting additional signs in areas where smoking is prohibited.
4. It shall be unlawful to remove or deface any sign posted under the authority of this section.
e. Enforcement and Penalties.
1. Penalty for Violation. Following oral or written notice by the person in charge of an area in which
smoking is prohibited or otherwise regulated by this section, or his or her designee, failure to cease
smoking constitutes an infraction punishable by a _ine of not more than $50.00. Any person or
department duly authorized to conduct law enforcement activities within Cumberland County shall
be authorized to issue a civil penalty citation to the violator by certi_ied mail or personal delivery of
such citation to the violator stating the nature of the violation, the amount of the penalty, and
directing that the violator pay the penalty to the Collection Division of the Finance Department, city
hall, within 14 days of receipt of the citation.

Sec. 12-2. Findings of Fact.
a. The _lood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Fayetteville are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of _lood protection and relief, and impairment
of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
b. These _lood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in _loodplains causing increases in
_lood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in _lood prone areas of uses vulnerable to _loods or
other hazards.
(Ord. No. S2006-013, § 1, 10-23-2006)
Sec. 12-3. Statement of Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize
public and private losses due to _lood conditions within _lood prone areas by provisions designed to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion
hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, _lood heights or velocities;
2. Require that uses vulnerable to _loods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against
_lood damage at the time of initial construction;
3. Control the alteration of natural _loodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which
are involved in the accommodation of _loodwaters;
4. Control _illing, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or _lood
damage; and
5. Prevent or regulate the construction of _lood barriers that will unnaturally divert _lood waters or which
may increase _lood hazards to other lands.
(Ord. No. S2006-013, § 1, 10-23-2006)
Sec. 12-4. Objec_ves.
The objectives of this chapter are:
1. To protect human life and health;

Areas designated as _loodways or non-encroachment areas are located within the special _lood hazard
areas established in article III, section 12-62. The _loodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely
hazardous areas due to the velocity of _loodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris and potential
projectiles. The following provisions, in addition to standards outlined in article V, sections 12-121 and 12-
122, shall apply to all development within such areas:
1. No encroachments, including _ill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated that:
a. The proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the _lood levels during the
occurrence of the base _lood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance
with standard engineering practice and presented to the _loodplain administrator prior to issuance
of _loodplain development permit, or
b. Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved by FEMA. A letter of map revision
(LOMR) must also be obtained upon completion of the proposed encroachment.

property during that time period. If the disorder activity count is no longer at or above the disorder risk
threshold, then no further action will be taken and the owner of the property will not be required to
continue to pay for registration the following year unless at that time the property is again at or above the
disorder risk threshold. If the disorder activity count continues to fall at or above the disorder risk
threshold, then the property will be designated in need of remedial action (INRA) and the police of_icial
and the owner shall amend and sign the remedial action plan and a second six-month review date will be
set.
b. At the second six-month review, the owner and police of_icial shall review the disorder activity in or on
the property since the date of the amended remedial action plan and determine the disorder activity
count for the property during that time period. If the disorder activity count is no longer at or above the
disorder risk threshold, then no further action will be taken. If the disorder activity count continues to fall
at or above the disorder risk threshold, then the police of_icial shall revoke the rental registration for the
property unless it is determined that the owner has complied in good faith with the remedial action plans.
1. In determining whether the owner has acted in good faith, the police of_icial shall weigh the following
factors:
a. Whether the owner has regularly met with the police of_icial; and
b. Whether the owner has exhausted all resources reasonably available to the owner in order to
comply with the terms of the remedial action plans; and
c. Whether the owner has intentionally ignored a term of a remedial action plan; and
d. Whether the disorder activity on the property constitutes a public nuisance.
2. If the owner has been found to have acted in good faith, then the police of_icial may remove the
designation of INRA and continue to work with the owner. A property that continues to fall at or above
the disorder risk threshold for a second year will be referred to the city attorney's of_ice for
determination as to whether a public nuisance action or any other legal or equitable remedy is
warranted.
c. All remedial action plans will be based on the procedures and practices set forth in the Fayetteville Police
Department Remedial Action Plan Manual; A Guide to Managing Rental Properties to Prevent Crime.

under section 14-105 without just cause; or

a. The city clerk shall forward an appeal of the police of_icial's decision to require rental registration, or

board. The police of_icial or development services of_icial shall prepare a summary of the case, including
all relevant data. The summary shall be provided to the board and the owner at least _ive working days
before the hearing.
b. Unless a quorum cannot be obtained or as otherwise agreed to by the owner and police of_icial or
development services of_icial, the board shall hold a hearing within 30 calendar days of the date the
appeal is received by the city clerk. Should the owner or the police of_icial or development services of_icial
desire a hearing date other than that set by the board, the owner or the police of_icial or development
services of_icial shall submit a written request for a change of the hearing date, stating the reason for the
request. The chair shall approve or disapprove such request, provided that such request is received by the
board at least seven calendar days prior to the date of the hearing. For good cause, the chair may continue
the hearing from time to time. The hearing shall be conducted with at least _ive voting members of the
board present.
c. The owner shall appear at the hearing in person and shall have the right to representation by a person of
his or her choice. The North Carolina Rules of Evidence, G.S. Chapter 8C, shall not strictly apply to the
hearing, but all parties shall have an opportunity to offer evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and inspect
documents. Only sworn testimony shall be accepted. The chair of the board, as well as any board member
designated by the chair, shall have the authority to administer the oath as set forth for witnesses in a civil
matter by G.S. § 11-11. All hearings before the board shall be de novo and recorded. The board has the
authority to develop rules and regulations consistent with this article to facilitate the hearing process.
d. In the event of an appeal of the police of_icial's decision to require registration, the city shall have the
burden of proof and must establish by the preponderance of the evidence that the disorder activity count
for the property falls at or above the disorder risk threshold. In the event of an appeal of a notice of
revocation due to disorder activity, the city shall have the burden of proof and must establish by the
preponderance of the evidence that the owner's property is in need of remedial action and the owner has
failed to act in good faith to comply with the remedial action plan. In the event of an appeal of a notice of
revocation due to code violations, the city shall have the burden of proof and must establish by the
preponderance of the evidence that the owner's property has been issued a notice of violation four or
more times in the previous 12-month period. After reviewing the evidence and hearing testimony from
the witnesses, the board shall issue _indings of fact and conclusions of law and issue an order either
af_irming or reversing the decision of the police of_icial or development services of_icial.
e. An owner has the right to appeal the board's decision to the city council by _iling a notice of appeal with
the city clerk within ten days after the board issues its written decision. When feasible, the matter will be
set for review by the city council at the next regularly scheduled business meeting. The city council shall
make its decision based on the record below, and no additional evidence will be considered. A majority
vote by the city council in favor of the board's decision is required to uphold the board's decision to
require registration or to revoke the owner's registration. An appeal to city council will stay the
proceedings until it completes its review.
f. If the city council upholds the board's decision, the owner shall have the right to seek judicial review of
the board's decision in a proceeding in the nature of certiorari instituted in the superior court of the
county within 30 days after the city council votes to uphold the board's decision. Judicial review shall not
automatically stay the registration requirement or revocation.

Sec. 16-94. Maximum Weight Limits for Trucks on City-Maintained Streets, Alleys, Bridges, and Public
Passageways.
a. For the purposes of this section, the provisions of G.S. 20-118 are incorporated by reference as if fully set
forth herein, and where there is a con_lict between the provisions of this section and G.S. 20-118, the
provisions of G.S. 20-118 shall prevail. Where the words "Department of Transportation" appear in G.S.
20-118, the words "City of Fayetteville" shall be substituted therefor and where the words "highway(s) on
the state highway system" appear, the words "streets, alleys, bridges and public passageways" shall be
substituted therefor.
b. The maximum weight limits as set forth in G.S. 20-118 are hereby imposed upon trucks driving upon
streets, alleys, bridges and public passageways operated and maintained by the city within the corporate
limits of the city. Any truck found in violation of the provisions of G.S. 20-118 and operating on a street,
alley, bridge and public passageway maintained by the city shall be penalized as set forth in G.S. 20-118.
The provisions of this section shall not apply to a truck being operated on a street, alley, bridge and public
passageway that is part of the state highway system and maintained by the state department of
transportation.
c. The city council shall designate on Schedule No. 19, Light Truck Traf_ic, of section 16-61 any street, alley,
bridge or public passageway within the corporate limits of the city as a light-traf_ic road when in the
opinion of the city engineer, such street, alley, bridge or public passageway is inadequate to carry and will
be injuriously affected by vehicles using the road carrying the maximum axle weight. All such streets,
alleys, bridges and public passageways so designated shall be conspicuously posted as light-traf_ic roads
and the maximum axle weight authorized shall be displayed on proper signs erected thereon. The
exceptions as set forth in G.S. 20-118(c) shall apply to light-traf_ic roads within the corporate limits of the

portable or stationary scales, and may require that such vehicle be driven to the nearest state department
of transportation stationary scale or stationary scales approved by the state department of agriculture in
the event such scales are within _ive miles. The law enforcement of_icer may then require the driver to
unload immediately such portion of the load as may be necessary to decrease the gross weight of such
vehicle to the maximum therefore speci_ied in G.S. 20-118. All material so unloaded shall be cared for by
the owner or operator of such vehicle at the risk of such owner or operator. Any person who refuses to
permit a vehicle being operated by him to be weighed as in this section provided or who refuses to drive
such vehicle upon the scales provided for weighing for the purpose of being weighed shall be in violation
of this article. No vehicle more than two miles from the state department of transportation stationary

the written _inal inspection report or the indemnity permit bond shall be forfeited to the city;
6. Upon satisfactory payment of any damages reported by the city engineer in the _inal inspector report,
the indemnity permit bond shall be discharged;
7. In the event that the contractor shall disagree with any decision of the city engineer, the contractor
may appeal that decision to the city manager within 15 days, and the city manager, after affording the
contractor an opportunity to be heard on the matter, shall make a _inal decision. Where the decision of
the city engineer involves the determination of either the amount of the bond to be posted or the
amount of damages after _inal inspection, as an alternative to appeal to the city manager, the city
engineer and the contractor shall jointly select a professional registered engineer to make the
determination, and any expenses incurred by such professional engineer shall be paid by the
contractor. The decision of the city manager or the independent professional engineer shall be _inal.

cautiously enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way
street, after stopping as required by subsections (a)(3)a and b of this section. Such vehicular traf_ic
shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traf_ic
lawfully using the intersection.
d. Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal, pedestrians facing a steady circular red or red
arrow signal alone shall not enter the roadway.

near side of the intersection, or if none, at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the
driver has a view of approaching traf_ic on the intersecting roadway before entering the
intersection, and the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
b. Flashing yellow (caution signal)—When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent _lashes,
drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection or past such signal only with caution.
c. Flashing red arrow and _lashing yellow arrow—Flashing red arrow and _lashing yellow arrow
indications have the same meaning as the corresponding _lashing circular indications, except that
they apply only to drivers of vehicles intending to make the movement indicated by the arrows.
b. At those places indicated on Traf_ic Schedule Nos. 2 and 16, adopted in section 16-61, and when traf_ic is
controlled by traf_ic control signals exhibiting the words "Go," "Caution," or "Stop," or exhibiting
differently colored lights, successively, one at a time, the following colors shall be used, and such terms

crosswalk.
2. Yellow alone, or "caution," when shown following the green or "go" signal.
a. Vehicular traf_ic facing the signal shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at the
intersection, but if such stop cannot be made in safety a vehicle may be driven cautiously through
the intersection.
b. Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is insuf_icient time to cross a roadway,
and any pedestrian then starting to cross shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles.
3. Red alone or "stop."
a. Vehicular traf_ic facing the signal shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection
or at such other point as may be indicated by a clearly visible line and shall remain standing until
green or "go" is shown alone; provided any vehicle, after coming to a complete stop for a red light
facing the vehicle, may make a right turn after yielding to pedestrians and other vehicles if not
otherwise prohibited.

of the governing body's police powers, it is declared to be the purposes of this section to prevent, prohibit,
and provide for the regulation and abatement of excessive and unnecessary noise which may injure the
physical and emotional health or welfare of its citizens or degrade the quality of life.
c. It is further recognized that there are many sources of excessive and unnecessary noise, which can and is
often generated when no city of_icial or law enforcement of_icer is present and able to take enforcement
action. It is therefore declared to be the purpose of this section to create a private cause of action for
enforcement of section 17-7 through 17-18 as set forth in section 17-17.

Sec. 17-23. Display of Sexually Explicit Material to Minors—Prohibited; Intent.

social value such material may have for minors can adequately be served by its availability to young persons
through their parents or guardians. It is also the purpose of these sections to prohibit the open public display
of certain explicit sexual materials, in order to protect persons from potential offense through involuntary
exposure to such materials.

CHAPTER 23 - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
Ar_cle I. - In General
Sec. 23-1. Findings.
The City Council of Fayetteville, North Carolina, makes the following _indings:
1. North Carolina General Statutes Ch. 160A, Article 16, authorizes the city to acquire, construct,
establish, enlarge, improve, maintain, own, operate and contract for the operation of stormwater
management programs designed to protect water quality by controlling the level of pollutants in, and
the quantity and _low of, stormwater and structural and natural stormwater and drainage systems of
all types.
2. The establishment of a stormwater management utility that would be accounted for as a separate
enterprise fund and would facilitate the provision of a stormwater management program is reasonable
and in the public interest.
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 292/938
3. North Carolina General Statute 160A-314 authorizes the city to establish and revise, from time to time,
a schedule of rates and charges to fund the stormwater management program activities including both
structural and natural stormwater conveyance and drainage system services provided by the
stormwater management utility.
(Ord. No. S2009-004, § 1, 5-26-2009)
Sec. 23-1.1. Ar_cle designa_on.
This article may be cited as the Stormwater Management Utility Ordinance of the City of Fayetteville.
(Ord. No. S2009-004, § 1, 5-26-2009)
Sec. 23-1.2. Purpose, Intent and Limita_ons of Responsibility.
a. A stormwater management utility is hereby created as an identi_ied _iscal and accounting fund for the
purpose of comprehensively addressing the stormwater management needs of the city. The city's
stormwater management needs are met herein; (1) through programs designed to protect and manage
water quality and quantity by controlling the level of pollutants in stormwater runoff, and the quantity
and rate of stormwater received and conveyed by structural and natural stormwater; (2) by establishing a
schedule of charges; (3) by de_ining the control, collection and disbursal of funds; and (4) by setting forth
penalties, methods of appeals and exemptions.
b. This article establishes that the city is only responsible for construction, maintenance and repair of
components of the stormwater drainage system that are located within city-owned drainage systems or
within city-owned righs-of-way. To the extent that the city elects to make available stormwater utility
funds for work on drainage system components located outside of city-owned rights-of-way or cityowned
drainage systems, such action will not constitute a transfer of responsibility or liability to the city
for any aspect of drainage systems located outside of city-owned rights-of-way or city-owned drainage
systems.
c. No action or inaction of the city pursuant to this section shall impose upon the city, its agents, of_icers, or
employees, any responsibility or liability of any kind, past or future, relating to any person or property. No
action by the city, including but not limited to funding of work on drainage system components not owned
by the city, shall be considered as a taking or appropriation of, or assumption of responsibility for any
stream, drain, ditch or other drainage system feature that is outside city-owned property or right-of-way.
City participation in work on drainage system components outside of the right-of-way is limited to the
extent to which funds are available for such purpose and no entitlement to receive funds for such work
arises from this division.
d. The city's evaluation, construction or repair of stormwater control measures and drainage facilities does
not constitute a warranty against stormwater hazards, including, but not limited to, _looding, erosion, or
standing water.

Sec. 23-2. Defini_ons.
As used in this article, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the following de_initions shall apply:
Credits. Credit shall mean ongoing reductions in the stormwater service charge applicable to a given
property in recognition of on-site or off-site systems, facilities, measures, and actions taken by customers to
reduce or mitigate the impact of their properties or actions on the peak rate of stormwater runoff from the
site or the pollutant loadings of stormwater runoff from the site. Credits shall be based on their impact on the
utility's long-term cost of providing services and facilities, not on the cost to the customer of acquiring,
designing, building, operating, maintaining or performing measures or actions to attain a credit. Credits shall
be conditioned on the continuing performance of the systems, facilities, measures or actions in reference to
standards adopted by the utility upon which the credits are granted, and may be revised or rescinded. In no
case shall credits exceed the amount of the stormwater service charge.
Customer. Customer shall mean the person or _irm to which a bill for stormwater service charges is sent.

issued by DENR, and provided that any such discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer
system shall be authorized by stormwater services.
If any of the above nonstormwater exceptions are found to be polluted and thus cause a negative
impact on the quality of the waters of the state, said situation or occurrence shall be deemed unlawful
and shall not be allowed to discharge to the municipal separate storm sewer system. These conditions
shall be determined by the manager of stormwater services or designee. Such situations or

management of the quantity and quality of stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private
property, prevent personal damage and bodily harm, ensure a functional drainage system, reduce the
effects of development on land and stream channel erosion, promote the attainment and maintenance of
water quality standards, enhance the local environment associated with the drainage system, reduce local
_looding, and maintain as nearly as possible the predeveloped runoff characteristics of the area, and
facilitate economic development while mitigating associated _looding and drainage impacts. Additionally,
the purpose of this article is to comply with the post construction stormwater requirements as per the
city's NPDES stormwater discharge permit.
c. Further, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 ("Clean Water Act") and federal Phase II
Stormwater Rules promulgated under it, as well as rules of the North Carolina Environmental
Management Commission promulgated in response to federal Phase II requirements, compel certain
urbanized areas, including this jurisdiction, to adopt minimum stormwater controls such as those
included in this article.
d. The application of this article and the provisions expressed herein, shall be the minimum stormwater
management requirements and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by
state statute. In addition, if site characteristics indicate that complying with these minimum requirements
will not provide adequate designs or protection for local property or residents, it is the designer's
responsibility to exceed the minimum requirements as necessary. The city engineer or designee shall be
responsible for the coordination and enforcement of the provisions of this article.
e. Compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal regulations and permits shall be the responsibility
of the applicant. Other stormwater regulations to consider when complying with this article include, but

than two lots before it is collected in a system of open channels, closed conduits, or a combination of both.
c. For all development activities, concentrated stormwater runoff leaving a development site must be
discharged directly into a well-de_ined, natural or manmade off-site receiving channel or pipe. If the
receiving channel or pipe is found to be inadequate, the developer must incorporate measures to either
improve the receiving channel or pipe to an adequate condition, or detain/retain runoff on the site to a
level that can be accommodated by the receiving channel or pipe. Newly constructed channels or pipes
shall be designed as adequate channels or pipes.
The development site should be designed to maximize the amount of rainfall that in_iltrates into the soils
and minimize the amount of direct _low into public drainage facilities, adjoining streets, waterbodies,
watercourses, and wetlands, to the extent feasible.

may result in assessment of penalties as speci_ied in section 23-46. For single-family residential
subdivisions, the original owner or applicant shall have primary responsibility for carrying out the
provisions of the maintenance agreement for a period of one year from the date of record-drawing
certi_ication described in section 23-37, or for a period of one year from the date the facility ceases to
function as an erosion control measure and starts to function as a stormwater management facility,
whichever is later. At the end of the one-year timeframe, the stormwater management facility shall be
inspected as outlined in section 23-41 in order to release the performance guarantee. Once the
stormwater management facility has passed inspection, primary responsibility for carrying out the
provisions of the maintenance agreement shall be transferred to a homeowners' association, property
owners' association, or similar entity. In cases where the city is accepting functional maintenance
responsibility, such responsibility shall be transferred to the city once the stormwater management
facility has passed inspection. A homeowners' association, property owners' association, or similar entity
shall still be responsible for routine maintenance such as mowing the grass and picking up litter.
1. The operation and maintenance agreement shall require the owner or owners to maintain, repair, and,
if necessary, reconstruct the stormwater management facility, and shall state the terms, conditions, and
schedule of maintenance for the stormwater management facility. In addition, it shall grant to the city a
right of entry in the event that the city engineer has reason to believe it has become necessary to
inspect, monitor, maintain, repair, or reconstruct the stormwater management facility; however, in no
case shall the right of entry, of itself, confer an obligation on the city to assume responsibility for the
stormwater management facility.
2. The operation and maintenance agreement must be approved by the city engineer prior to _inal
approval, and it shall be referenced on the _inal plat and shall be recorded with the Cumberland County
Register of Deeds upon _inal plat approval. A copy of the recorded maintenance agreement shall be
given to the city engineer within 14 days following its recordation.

b. Special requirement for homeowners' and other associations. For all stormwater management facilities
required pursuant to this article and that are to be or are owned and maintained by a homeowners'
association, property owners' association, or similar entity in a single-family residential subdivision, the
required operation and maintenance agreement shall include all of the following provisions:
1. Acknowledgment that the association shall continuously operate and maintain the stormwater control
and management facilities.
2. Establishment of an escrow account, which can be spent solely for sediment removal, structural,
biological or vegetative replacement, major repair, or reconstruction of the stormwater management
facilities. If stormwater management facilities are not performing adequately or as intended or are not
properly maintained, the city, in its sole discretion, may remedy the situation, and in such instances the
city shall be fully reimbursed from the escrow account. Escrowed funds may be spent by the
association for sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major repair, and
reconstruction of the stormwater management facilities.
3. Both developer and homeowners' association contributions shall fund the escrow account. Prior to the
release of the installation performance guarantee as outlined in section 23-41(b), the developer shall
pay into the escrow account an amount equal to 15 percent of the initial construction cost of the
stormwater management facilities. Two-thirds of the total initial construction cost shall be deposited
into the escrow account within the _irst _ive years and the full amount shall be deposited within ten
years following initial construction of the stormwater management facilities. Funds shall be deposited
each year into the escrow account. A portion of the annual assessments of the association shall include
an allocation into the escrow account. Any funds drawn down from the escrow account shall be
replaced in accordance with the schedule of anticipated work used to create the escrow account
budget.
4. The percent of developer contribution and lengths of time to fund the escrow account may be varied by
the city depending on the design and materials of the stormwater control and management facility.
5. Granting to the city a right of entry to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair, and reconstruct stormwater
management facilities.
6. Allowing the city to recover from the association and its members any and all costs the city expends to
maintain or repair the stormwater management facilities or to correct any operational de_iciencies.
Failure to pay the city all of its expended costs, after 45 days' written notice, shall constitute a breach of
the agreement. In case of a de_iciency, the city shall thereafter be entitled to bring an action against the
association and its members to pay, or foreclose upon the lien hereby authorized by the agreement
against the property, or both, in case of a de_iciency. Interest, collection costs, and attorney fees shall be
added to the recovery.
7. A statement that this agreement shall not obligate the city to maintain or repair any stormwater
management facilities, and the city shall not be liable to any person for the condition or operation of
stormwater management facilities.
8. A statement that this agreement shall not in any way diminish, limit, or restrict the right of the city to
enforce any of its ordinances as authorized by law.
9. A provision indemnifying and holding harmless the city for any costs and injuries arising from or
related to the stormwater management facility, unless the city has agreed in writing to assume the
maintenance responsibility for the stormwater management facility and has accepted dedication of
any and all rights necessary to carry out that maintenance.

online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 327/938
a. Person maintaining condition resulting in or constituting violation. An architect, engineer, builder,
contractor, developer, agency, or any other person who participates in, assists, directs, creates,
causes, or maintains a condition that constitutes a violation of this article, or fails to take
appropriate action, so that a violation of this article results or persists.
b. Responsibility for land or use of land. The owner of the land on which the violation occurs, any
tenant or occupant of the property, any person who is responsible for stormwater controls or
practices pursuant to a private agreement or public document, or any person, who has control over,
or responsibility for, the use, development or redevelopment of the property.
b. Remedies and penalties. The remedies and penalties provided for violations of this article, whether civil or
criminal, shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedy provided by law, and may be exercised
in any order.
1. Remedies.
a. Withholding of certi_icate of occupancy. The city engineer or other authorized agent may refuse to
issue a certi_icate of occupancy for the building or other improvements constructed or being
constructed on the site and served by the stormwater practices in question until the applicant or
other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has
otherwise cured the violations described therein. This remedy shall not apply to buildings in a
single-family residential subdivision.
b. Disapproval of subsequent permits and development approvals. As long as a violation of this article
continues and remains uncorrected, the city engineer or other authorized agent may withhold, and
the city council may disapprove, any request for permit or development approval or authorization
provided for by this article or the zoning, subdivision, and/or building regulations, as appropriate,
for the land on which the violation occurs.
c. Injunction, abatements, etc. The city engineer, with the written authorization of the city manager,

2. Civil penalties.
a. Violations of article. A violation of any of the provisions of this article or rules or other orders
adopted or issued pursuant to this article may subject the violator to a civil penalty. A civil penalty
may be assessed from the date the violation occurs. No penalty shall be assessed until the person
alleged to be in violation has been noti_ied of the violation. Refusal to accept the notice or failure to
notify the city engineer of a change of address shall not relieve the violator's obligation to comply
with this article or to pay such a penalty.
b. Amount of penalty. The civil penalty for each violation of this article may be up to the maximum
allowed by law. Each day of continuing violation shall constitute a separate violation. In determining
the amount of the civil penalty, the city engineer shall consider any relevant mitigating and
aggravating factors including, but not limited to, the effect, if any, of the violation; the degree and
extent of harm caused by the violation; the cost of rectifying the damage; whether the violator saved
money through noncompliance; whether the violator took reasonable measures to comply with this
article; whether the violation was committed willfully; whether the violator reported the violation
to the city engineer; and the prior record of the violator in complying or failing to comply with this
article or any other post construction article or law. The city engineer is authorized to vary the

c. Notice of assessment of civil penalty. The city engineer shall determine the amount of the civil
penalty and shall notify the violator of the amount of the penalty and the reason for assessing the
penalty. This notice of assessment of civil penalty shall be served by any means authorized under
G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4, and shall direct the violator to either pay the assessment or _ile an appeal within
30 days of receipt of the notice as speci_ied in subsection (2)e., below.
d. Failure to pay civil penalty assessment. If a violator does not pay a civil penalty assessed by the city
engineer within 30 days after it is due, or does not request a hearing as provided in subsection (2)e.,
below, the city engineer shall request the initiation of a civil action to recover the amount of the
assessment. The civil action shall be brought in Cumberland County Superior Court or in any other
court of competent jurisdiction. A civil action must be _iled within three years of the date the
assessment was due. An assessment that is appealed is due at the conclusion of the administrative
and judicial review of the assessment.
e. Appeal of remedy or penalty. The issuance of a notice of assessment of a civil penalty by the city
engineer shall entitle the responsible party or entity to an appeal before the city council if such
person submits written demand for an appeal hearing to the city clerk within 30 days of the receipt
of a notice of assessment of a civil penalty. The demand for an appeal shall be accompanied by a
_iling fee as established by city council. The appeal of a notice of assessment of a civil penalty shall
be conducted as described in section 23-45 of this article.
3. Criminal penalties. A violation of this article may be enforced as a misdemeanor subject to the
maximum _ine permissible under North Carolina law.
c. Procedures.
1. Authority to inspect. The city engineer shall have the authority, upon presentation of proper
credentials, to enter and inspect any land, building, structure, or premises to ensure compliance
with this article, or rules or orders adopted or issued pursuant to this article, and to determine
whether the activity is being conducted in accordance with this article and the approved
stormwater design plan, and whether the measures required in the plan are effective. No person
shall willfully resist, delay, or obstruct the city engineer while the city engineer is inspecting or
attempting to inspect an activity under this article.
2. Notice of violation and order to correct. When the city engineer _inds that any building, structure, or
land is in violation of this article, the city engineer shall notify in writing the responsible
person/entity. The noti_ication shall indicate the nature of the violation, contain the address or
other description of the site upon which the violation occurred or is occurring, order the necessary
action to abate the violation, and give a deadline for correcting the violation. The notice shall, if
required, specify a date by which the responsible person/entity must comply with this article, and
advise that the responsible person/entity is subject to remedies and/or penalties or that failure to
correct the violation within the time speci_ied will subject the responsible person/entity to
remedies and/or penalties as described in this section of this article. In determining the measures
required and the time for achieving compliance, the city engineer shall take into consideration the
technology and quantity of work required, and shall set reasonable and attainable time limits. The
city engineer may deliver the notice of violation and correction order personally, by the Fayetteville
Police, by certi_ied or registered mail, return receipt requested, or by any means authorized for the
service of documents by Rule 4 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.
If a violation is not corrected within a reasonable period of time, as provided in the noti_ication, the
city engineer may take appropriate action under this article to correct and abate the violation and
to ensure compliance with this article.
3. Extension of time. A person who receives a notice of violation and correction order, or the owner of
the land on which the violation occurs, may submit to the city engineer a written request for an
extension of time for correction of the violation. On determining that the request includes enough
information to show that the violation cannot be corrected within the speci_ied time limit for
reasons beyond the control of the person requesting the extension, the city engineer may extend
the time limit as is reasonably necessary to allow timely correction of the violation, up to, but not
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 329/938
exceeding 60 days. The city engineer may grant 30-day extensions in addition to the foregoing
extension if the violation cannot be corrected within the permitted time due to circumstances
beyond the control of the person violating this article. The city engineer may grant an extension
only by written notice of extension. The notice of extension shall state the date prior to which
correction must be made, after which the violator will be subject to the penalties described in the
notice of violation and correction order.
4. Enforcement after time to correct. After the time has expired to correct a violation, including any
extension(s) if authorized by the city engineer, the city engineer shall determine if the violation is
corrected. If the violation is not corrected, the city engineer may act to impose one or more of the
remedies and penalties authorized by this article.
5. Emergency enforcement. If delay in correcting a violation would seriously threaten the effective
enforcement of this article or pose an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare,
then the city engineer may order the immediate cessation of a violation. Any person so ordered
shall cease any violation immediately. The city engineer may seek immediate enforcement, without
prior written notice, through any remedy or penalty authorized by this article.

Editor's note— The city enacted Resolution No. R2007-031 on June 11, 2007, the introductory language of
which reads as follows:
AN ORDINANCE AMENDING CUMBERLAND COUNTY CODECHAPTER 12, "STORMWATER MANAGEMENT"
THE CUMBERLAND COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS HEREBY ORDAINS:
Section 1. Chapter 12 of the Cumberland County Code is hereby amended to read, and adopted, as follows:
The provisions of Resolution No. R2007-031 have been included in this Code as Chapter 23
Cross reference— Building code, ch. 7; _lood damage prevention, ch. 12; health and sanitation, ch. 13;
streets and sidewalks, ch. 24; water and sewers, ch. 28; water supply watershed management and protection,
ch. 29.
State Law reference— Interlocal cooperation, G.S. 160A-460 et seq.
CHAPTER 24 - STREETS AND SIDEWALKS
Ar_cle I. - In General
Sec. 24-1. Findings and Purpose Regarding Use of Public Rights-of-Way.
a. The city _inds that the passage of a Telecommunications Act of 1996 has resulted in increased use of the
public rights-of-way and increased costs to the taxpayers of the city and that these costs are likely to
continue into the foreseeable future.
b. The city _inds that excavation and occupancy of the public rights-of-way causes direct and indirect costs
to be borne by the city and its taxpayers, including, but not limited to:
1. Administrative costs associated with public right-of-way projects, such as registration, permitting,
inspection and supervision, supplies and materials.
2. Repair costs to the roadway associated with the actual excavation into the public right-of-way.
3. Degradation costs de_ined as depreciation caused to the roadway in terms of decreased useful life, due
to excavations into the public rights-of-way.
c. In response to the foregoing facts, the city hereby enacts sections 24-1 through 24-5 relating to
administration of and permits to excavate, obstruct and/or occupy the public rights-of-way, together with
an ordinance making necessary revisions to other Code provisions. Sections 24-1 through 24-5impose
reasonable regulations on the placement and maintenance of facilities currently within its rights-of-way
or to be placed therein at some future time. These sections are intended to complement the regulatory
roles of state and federal agencies.
d. The city's authority to enact this ordinance is pursuant, but not limited, to G.S. 160A-194, 160A-296, and
160A-311 et seq.
e. The purpose of sections 24-1 through 24-5 is to provide the city a legal framework within which to
regulate and manage the public rights-of-way, and to provide for recovery of costs. Sections 24-1 through
24-5 provide for the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the city as they use the rights-of-way of
the city, as well as to ensure the structural integrity of the public rights-of-way. The city desires to
minimize and anticipate the number of excavations taking place thereon and to regulate the placement of
facilities within the rights-of-way to ensure that they remain available for public services. The taxpayers
of the city bear the _inancial burden for the upkeep of the rights-of-way. A primary cause for the early and
excessive deterioration of its rights-of-way is the frequent excavations by persons who locate facilities
therein.
f. Under this chapter, all persons who excavate, obstruct and/or occupy the public rights-of-way will
reimburse the city's administrative, ongoing management and degradation costs as set forth in this
chapter. Right-of-way users will bear a fair share of the _inancial responsibility for the integrity of the
public rights-of-way.

d. Warranty for work in public right-of-way. Each franchise holder, licensee, utility or permittee performing
an excavation or utility work shall warrant its excavation and restoration work against any and all defects
in workmanship and materials until the road upon which the excavation or work occurred is re-surfaced
extending beyond the point of the excavation or work. In the event that the city engineer determines that
any portion of the pavement or surface of any public right-of-way affected by an excavation or utility work
is in need of repairs, by reason of any defect in workmanship or materials, the city engineer shall serve
upon the franchise holder, licensee, utility, or permittee a written notice stating the repairs necessary, and
requiring the repairs to be made within thirty (30) days after the date of the notice unless, in the city
engineer’s opinion, the scope of the work to repair the defect is limited and a shorter notice period which
gives the utility suf_icient time to do the work is warranted. Re-inspection by the city shall be performed
upon completion of the work. If the repairs are not timely made, the city engineer shall at once make or
cause the repairs to be made at the expense of the franchise holder, licensee, utility or permittee. The
expenses, including any related administrative expenses, shall be charged to the franchise holder,
licensee, utility or permittee, and the franchise holder, licensee, utility or permittee shall be required to
pay the cost within (30) days following receipt of noti_ication of the expenses. No additional permits will
be issued for any particular franchise holder, licensee, utility or permittee until it is in compliance with
the provisions of this article. At the discretion of the city engineer the warranty period referenced herein
may be reduced to three (3) years if all restoration, compaction and testing requirements are followed in
accordance with city standards. This ordinance may be enforced by an appropriate equitable remedy
issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction, pursuant to G.S. 160A-175.

be restored and the methods and materials to be used for the restoration. The restoration area shall be
adjusted in the _ield to meet special conditions including, but not limited to, previous paving and patching
limits. Groundcover must be properly established no later than seven (7) days from completion of work
in the speci_ic area.
b. Restoration Method. After completion of the excavation, etc., any trench or opening in any street or
sidewalk shall be carefully and thoroughly back_illed in uniform six-inch layers, using select materials of a
type approved by the city engineer, in compliance with city standards for compaction. The material used
in replacing the surface course shall be of the same type and thickness and equal in quality to that which
was removed. Upon approval by the city engineer, excavatable _lowable _ill in accordance with the City’s
technical speci_ications may be used instead of back_ill from the invert to the base layer elevation. In the

extension and pay any additional fees required thereby, and (ii) be granted a new permit or permit
extension.
b. Limitations on dates. An excavation permit is valid only for the dates speci_ied in the permit. No permittee
may begin its work before the permit start date or, except as provided in this article, continue working

arrangement is made with the holder or any corporation, _irm, or association with which the holder may
be interested or connected. Failure to _ile such copies within seven days of their execution shall be

stand privileges.

business telephone numbers listed in his name, and the names of all drivers, their license numbers and

of this article to impose such responsibilities upon each owner.

Sec. 28-132. No_fica_on of the Discharge of Hazardous Waste.
The PWC prohibits the discharge of any hazardous wastes without noti_ication and approval of the
general manager.
1. Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the PWC, the EPA regional
waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any
discharge into the municipal wastewater system of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would
be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such noti_ication must include the name of the
hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste
per calendar month to the municipal wastewater system, the noti_ication also shall contain the
following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: An
identi_ication of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharge during the calendar month, and an
estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the
following 12 months. All noti_ications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge
commences. Any noti_ication under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous
waste discharge. However, noti_ications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 28-
128 of this article. The noti_ication requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already
reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring
requirements of sections 28-124, 28-126, 28-127 of this article.
2. Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a), above, during a calendar month in
which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute
hazardous wastes as speci_ic in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms
of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as
speci_ied in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time noti_ication. Subsequent months
during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional noti_ication.
3. In the case of any new regulation under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of
hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
general manager, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state hazardous
waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such
regulations.

a. All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and _low
measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at
all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds
for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
b. Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sul_ide, volatile organic
compounds, and any other pollutants as required by 40 CFR 136. The general manager shall determine
the number of grabs necessary to be representative of the user's discharge. See 40 CFR 403.12(g)(5) for
additional grab sample number requirements for BMR and 90-day compliance reports. Additionally, the
general manager may allow collection of multiple grabs during a 24-hour period which are composited
prior to analysis as allowed under 40 CFR 136.
c. Composite samples: All wastewater composite samples shall be collected with a minimum of hourly
aliquots or grabs for each hour that there is a discharge. All wastewater composite samples shall be
collected using _low proportional composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the general manager. When authorizing time-proportional
composites or grabs, the samples must be representative and the decision to allow the alternative
sampling must be documented.

Division 6. - Compliance Monitoring
Sec. 28-147. Monitoring Facili_es.
The PWC requires the user to provide and operate at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to
allow inspection, sampling, and _low measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems.
The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the PWC may, when such a
location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the
public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and
preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at
all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be
provided in accordance with the requirements of the PWC and all applicable local construction standards
and speci_ications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written noti_ication by the PWC.
(Ord. No. S2011-015, § 1, 11-28-2011)
Sec. 28-148. Inspec_on and Sampling.
The PWC will inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article is being met
and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is
created or discharged shall allow the PWC, approval authority and EPA or their representative ready access
at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying or in the performance of any of their duties. The PWC, approval authority and EPA
shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling,
inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force
which would require proper identi_ication and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identi_ication,
personnel from the PWC, approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the
purposes of performing their speci_ic responsibilities. Denial of the PWC's, the approval authority's, or EPA's
access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article. Unreasonable delays may constitute denial of
access.
(Ord. No. S2011-015, § 1, 11-28-2011)
Sec. 28-149. Search Warrants.
If the PWC, approval authority, or EPA has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any
part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article,
or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the
PWC designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect

Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and
monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency
without restriction unless the user speci_ically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
general manager that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. Any such request must be asserted at the time
of submission of the information or data.
When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report that might disclose trade
secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made
available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this article, the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, non-discharge permit and/or the pretreatment
programs; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any
state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as con_idential information.

Division 8. - Enforcement
Sec. 28-160. Administra_ve Remedies.
The PWC may utilize all of the enforcement tools available through the PWC enforcement response plan
to address escalating enforcement actions dependent on the nature of the violation and to cooperativeness,
or recalcitrance, of the violator. Enforcement actions may include, but are not limited to the following:
1. Noti_ication of violation: Whenever the general manager _inds that any industrial user has violated or
is violating this article, wastewater permit, or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained
therein or any other pretreatment requirement the general manager may serve upon such a person a
written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within the time frame stated in the notice, an
explanation for the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the
PWC by the user. Submission of this plan does not relieve the discharger of liability for any violations
occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
2. Consent orders: The general manager is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the person
responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include speci_ic action to be taken by the
discharger to correct the noncompliance within a time period also speci_ied by the order. Consent
orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order issued pursuant to section 28-
160(4), below.
3. Show cause hearing: The general manager may order any industrial user who causes or is responsible
for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this article or is in noncompliance with a wastewater
discharge permit to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. In the event
the general manager determines that a show cause order should be issued, a notice shall be served on
the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons
for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 447/938
not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certi_ied mail
(return receipt requested) at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or
of_icer of a corporation.
The general manager shall review the evidence presented at the hearing and determine whether the
proposed enforcement action is appropriate.
A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite to the assessment of a civil penalty under
section 28-161 of this article nor is any action or inaction taken by the general manager under this
section subject to an administrative appeal under section 28-174.
4. Administrative orders: When the general manager _inds that an industrial user has violated or
continues to violate this article, permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
requirement the general manager may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct
those persons in noncompliance to do any of the following:
a. Immediately comply with all requirements;
b. Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth in the order;
c. Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of a continuing or threatened violation;
d. Disconnect unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are
installed and properly operated within a speci_ied time period.
5. Emergency suspensions: The general manager may immediately suspend the wastewater treatment
service and/or wastewater permit when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons or the environment, interferes with the municipal wastewater system or
causes the PWC to violate any condition of its NPDES or non-discharge permit.
Any user noti_ied of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater permit
shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. A hearing will be held within 15 days of the
notice of suspension to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the user's waste discharge
permit terminated. In the event of a failure to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
general manager shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the municipal wastewater system or
endangerment to any individuals. The general manager shall reinstate the wastewater permit and the
wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncompliant discharge. The
industrial user shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the general manager prior to
the date of the above-described hearing.
6. Termination of permit or permission to discharge: The general manager may revoke a wastewater
discharge permit or permission to discharge for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following
reasons:
a. Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of his discharge;
b. Failure to report signi_icant changes in operations, or wastewater constituents and characteristics;
c. Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or,
d. Violation of conditions of the permit or permission to discharge, conditions of this article, or any
applicable state and federal regulations.
Noncompliant industrial users will be noti_ied of the proposed termination of their wastewater permit
and will be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 28-160 of this article as to why the
proposed action should not be taken.

years preceding the violation; or
2. In the case of failure to _ile, submit, or make available, as the case may be, any documents, data, or
reports required by this article, or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder, only if
the general manager determines that the violation was intentional and a civil penalty has been
imposed against the violator within the _ive years preceding the violation.
c. In determining the amount of the civil penalty, the general manager shall consider the following:
1. The degree and extent of the harm to the natural resources, to the public health, or to public or private
property resulting from the violation;

the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated
time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The general manager may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis
if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
c. 1. Bypass is prohibited, and the general manager may take an enforcement action against a user for a
bypass, unless:
a. Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
b. There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities,
retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This
condition is not satis_ied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise
of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of
equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
c. The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (b) of this section.
2. The general manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the
general manager determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this
section.

(Ord. No. S2008-009, § 1, 7-28-2008)
Sec. 28-232. Objec_ves of Ar_cle.
The speci_ic objectives of this cross connection control article for the public works commission of the city
are as follows:
1. To protect the public potable water supply of the city against actual or potential contamination by
isolating within the consumer's water system contaminants or pollutants which could, under adverse
conditions, back_low through uncontrolled cross connections into the public water system.
2. To eliminate or control existing cross connections, actual or potential, between the consumer's potable
water system and non-potable or industrial piping system.
3. To provide a continuing inspection program of cross connection control which will systematically and
effectively control all actual or potential cross connections which may be installed in the future.
(Ord. No. S2008-009, § 1, 7-28-2008)
Sec. 28-233. Responsibili_es.
a. Health agency. The state department of environment and natural resources has the responsibility for
promulgating and enforcing laws, rules, regulations, and policies to be followed in carrying out an
effective cross connection control program. The state department of environment and natural resources
also has the primary responsibility of insuring that the water purveyor operates the public potable water
system free of actual or potential sanitary hazards, including unprotected cross connections. The state
department of environment and natural resources has the further responsibility of insuring that the
water purveyor provides an approved water supply at the service connection to the consumer's water
system and, further, that he requires the installation, testing, and maintenance of an approved back_low
prevention assembly on the service connection when required.
b. Water purveyor. Except as otherwise provided in this article, the water purveyor's (public works
commission's) responsibility to ensure a safe water supply begins at the source and includes all of the
public water distribution system, including the service connection, and ends at the point of delivery to the
consumer's water system. In addition, the water purveyor shall exercise reasonable vigilance to insure
that the consumer has taken the proper steps to protect the public potable water system. To insure that
the proper precautions are taken, the public works commission is required to determine the degree of
hazard or potential hazard to the public potable water system; to determine the degree of protection
required; and to ensure proper containment protection through an on-going inspection program. When it
is determined that a back_low prevention assembly is required for the protection of the public system, the
public works commission shall require the consumer, at the consumer's expense, to install an approved
back_low prevention assembly at each service connection, to test immediately upon installation and
thereafter at a frequency as determined by the public works commission, to properly repair and maintain
such assembly or assemblies and to keep adequate records of each test and subsequent maintenance and
repair, including materials and/or replacement parts.
c. Plumbing inspection. The plumbing inspection departments of the city and the county have the
responsibility to not only review building plans and inspect plumbing as it is installed; but, they have the
explicit responsibility of preventing cross connections from being designed and built into the plumbing
system within its jurisdiction. Where the review of building plans suggests or detects the potential for
cross connections being made an integral part of the plumbing system, the plumbing inspector has the
responsibility, under the state building code, for requiring that such cross connections be either
eliminated or provided with back_low prevention equipment approved by the state building code. The
plumbing inspector's responsibility begins at the point of delivery, downstream of the _irst installed
back_low prevention assembly, and continues throughout the entire length of the consumer's water
system. The plan inspector should inquire about the intended use of water at any point where it is
suspected that a cross connection might be made or where one is actually called for by the plans. When
such is discovered it shall be mandatory that a suitable, approved back_low prevention assembly
approved by the state building code be required by the plans and be properly installed. The primary
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 454/938
protection assembly for containment purposes only shall have approval from the public works
commission, the state building code, and the state department of environment and natural resources.
d. Consumer. The consumer has the primary responsibility of preventing pollutants and contaminants from
entering his potable water system or the public potable water system. The consumer's responsibility
starts at the point of delivery from the public potable water system and includes all of his water system.
The consumer, at his own expense, shall install, operate, test, and maintain approved back_low prevention
assemblies as directed by the public works commission. The consumer shall maintain accurate records of
tests and repairs made to back_low prevention assemblies and shall maintain such records for a minimum
period of three years. The records shall be on forms approved by the public works commission and shall
include the list of materials or replacement parts used. Following any repair, overhaul, repiping or
relocation of an assembly, the consumer shall have it tested to insure that it is in good operating condition
and will prevent back_low. Tests, maintenance and repairs of back_low prevention assemblies shall be
made by a certi_ied back_low prevention assembly tester.
e. Certi_ied back_low prevention assembly testers. When employed by the consumer to test, repair, overhaul,
or maintain back_low prevention assemblies, a back_low prevention assembly tester will have the
following responsibilities: The tester will be responsible for making competent inspections and for
repairing or overhauling back_low prevention assemblies and making reports of such repair to the
consumer and responsible authorities on forms approved by the public works commission. The tester
shall include the list of materials or replacement parts used. The tester shall be equipped with and be
competent to use all the necessary tools, gauges, manometers and other equipment necessary to properly
test, repair, and maintain back_low prevention assemblies. It will be the tester's responsibility to insure
that original manufactured parts are used in the repair of or replacement of parts in a back_low
prevention assembly. It will be the tester's further responsibility not to change the design, material or
operational characteristics of an assembly during repair or maintenance without prior approval of the
public works commission. A certi_ied tester shall perform the work and be responsible for the
competency and accuracy of all tests and reports. A certi_ied tester shall provide a copy of all test and
repair reports to the consumer and to the public works commission's cross connection control
department within ten business days of any completed test or repair work. A certi_ied tester shall
maintain such records for a minimum period of three years. All certi_ied back_low prevention assembly
testers must obtain and employ back_low prevention assembly test equipment which has been evaluated
and/or approved by the public works commission. All test equipment shall be registered with the public
works commission cross connection control department. All test equipment shall be checked for accuracy
annually, at a minimum, calibrated, if necessary, and certi_ied to the public works commission as to such
calibration, employing an accuracy/calibration method acceptable to the public works commission. All
certi_ied back_low prevention assembly testers must become re-certi_ied every two years through an
approved back_low prevention certi_ication program.

Back-pressure back_low means any elevation in the consumer water system, by pump, elevation of piping, or
steam and/or air pressure, above the supply pressure at the point of delivery which would cause, or tend to
cause, a reversal of the normal direction of _low.
Back-Siphonage Back_low means a reversal of the normal direction of _low in the pipeline due to a
negative pressure (vacuum) being created in the supply line with the back_low source subject to atmospheric
pressure.
Check Valve—Approved. The term "approved check valve" means a check valve that is drip-tight in the
normal direction of _low when the inlet pressure is at least one psi and the outlet pressure is zero. The check
valve shall permit no leakage in a direction reverse to the normal _low. The closure element (e.g. clapper,
poppet, or other design) shall be internally loaded to promote rapid and positive closure. An approved check
valve is only one component of an approved back_low prevention assembly, i.e., pressure vacuum breaker,
double check valve assembly, double check detector assembly, reduced pressure principle assembly, or
reduced pressure detector assembly.
Consumer means any person, _irm, or corporation using or receiving water from the public works
commission water system.
Consumer's Potable Water System means that portion of the privately owned potable water system
lying between the point of delivery and point of use and/or isolation protection. This system will include all
pipes, conduits, tanks, receptacles, _ixtures, equipment, and appurtenances used to produce, convey, store, or
use potable water.
Consumer's Water System means any water system commencing at the point of delivery and
continuing throughout the consumer's plumbing system, located on the consumer's premises, whether
supplied by a public potable water or an auxiliary water supply. The system or systems may be either a
potable water system or an industrial piping system.
Containment means preventing the impairment of the public potable water supply by installing an
approved back_low prevention assembly at the service connection.
Contamination means an impairment of the quality of the water which creates a potential or actual
hazard to the public health through the introduction of hazardous or toxic substances or through the spread
of disease by sewage, industrial _luids, or waste.
Cross Connection means any unprotected actual or potential connection or structural arrangement
between a public or a consumer's water system and any other source or system through which it is possible
to introduce any contamination or pollution, other than the intended potable water with which the system is
supplied. Bypass arrangements, jumper connections, removable sections, swivel or change-over devices, and
other temporary or permanent devices through which or because of which "back_low" can or may occur are
considered to be cross connections.
Double Check Detector Assembly means a specially designed assembly composed of a line-size
approved double check valve assembly with a speci_ic bypass water meter and a meter-sized approved
double check valve assembly. The meter shall register (in U.S. gallons) accurately for only very low rates of

online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 457/938
Hazard—Non-Health. The term "non-health hazard" means an actual or potential threat to the quality
of the public or the consumer's potable water system. A non-health hazard is one that, if introduced into the
public water supply system, could be a nuisance to water customers, but would not adversely affect human
health.
Hazard—Pollutional. The term "pollutional hazard" means an actual or potential threat to the quality
or the potability of the public or the consumer's potable water system but which would not constitute a
health or a system hazard, as de_ined. The maximum degree or intensity of pollution to which the potable
water system could be degraded under this de_inition would cause a nuisance or be aesthetically
objectionable or could cause minor damage to the system or its appurtenances.
Health Agency means the state department of environment and natural resources.
Industrial Fluids means any _luid or solution which may be chemically, biologically, or otherwise
contaminated or polluted in a form or concentration such as would constitute a health or nonhealth hazard if
introduced into a public or consumer potable water system. Such _luids may include, but are not limited to:
process waters; chemicals in _luid form; acids and alkalis; oils, gases; etc.
Industrial Piping System—Consumer's. The term "consumer's industrial piping system" means any
system used by the consumer for transmission of or to con_ine or store any _luid, solid or gaseous substance
other than an approved water supply. Such a system would include all pipes, conduits, tanks, receptacles,
_ixtures, equipment, and appurtenances used to produce, convey, or store substances which are or may be
polluted or contaminated.
Industrial User means a customer that is classi_ied as a manufacturing industry by the North American
Industrial Classi_ication Standard (NAICS), published by the U.S. Government Census Bureau. More than 50
percent of the customer's utility usage must be for its manufacturing purposes.
Isolation means the act of con_ining a localized hazard within a consumer's water system by installing
approved back_low prevention assemblies. Disclaimer: The public works commission may make
recommendations, upon facility inspection, as to the usages of isolation devices/assemblies, but does not
assume or have responsibility whatsoever for such installations.
Point of Delivery means generally at the property line of the customer, adjacent to the public street
where the public works commission's mains are located, or at a point on the customer's property where the
meter is located. The customer shall be responsible for all water piping and control devices located on the
customer's side of the point of delivery.
Pollution means an impairment of the quality of the water to a degree which does not create an actual
hazard to the public health but which does adversely and unreasonably affect the aesthetic qualities of such
waters for domestic use.
Potable Water means water from any source which has been investigated by the state department of
environment and natural resources and which has been approved for human consumption.
Public Potable Water System means any publicly or privately owned water system operated as a
public utility, under a current state department of environment and natural resources permit, to supply
water for public consumption or use. This system will include all sources, facilities, and appurtenances
between the source and the point of delivery such as valves, pumps, pipes, conduits, tanks, receptacles,
_ixtures, equipment, and appurtenances used to produce, convey, treat, or store a potable water for public
consumption or use.
Reduced Pressure Principle Back_low Prevention Assembly means an assembly containing
within its structure a minimum of two independently acting, approved check valves, together with a
hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, pressure differential relief valve located between the
check valves and at the same time below the _irst check valve. The _irst check valve reduces the supply
pressure a predetermined amount so that during normal _low and at cessation of normal _low, the pressure
between the checks is less than the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the pressure
differential relief valve, by discharge to atmosphere, shall operate to maintain the pressure between the
checks less than the supply pressure. The unit shall include tightly closing shutoff valves located at each end
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 458/938
of the assembly and each assembly shall be _itted with properly located test cocks. The assembly is designed
to protect against a health hazard (i.e., contaminant).
Reduced Pressure Principle Detector Assembly means a specially designed assembly composed of
a line-size approved reduced pressure principle back_low prevention assembly with a speci_ic bypass water
meter and a meter-sized approved reduced pressure principle back_low prevention assembly. The meter
shall register, in U.S. gallons, accurately for only very low rates of _low and shall show a registration for all
rates of _low. This assembly shall be used to protect against a health hazard (i.e., contaminant).
Residential means an individual residence, de_ined as a single dwelling unit, which provides permanent
and independent facilities complete for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation. An individual
residence may include a house, condominium, modular home, mobile home, or individually metered
apartment.
Split Tap means a line that is split prior to the point of delivery.
Vacuum Breaker—Atmospheric Type. The term "atmospheric vacuum breaker," also known as the
"nonpressure type vacuum breaker," means a device containing a _loat-check, a check seat, and an air inlet
port. The _low of water into the body causes the _loat to close the air inlet port. When the _low of water stops,
the _loat falls and forms a check valve against back-siphonage and at the same time opens the air inlet port to
allow air to enter and satisfy the vacuum. A shutoff valve immediately upstream may be an integral part of
the device. An atmospheric vacuum breaker is designed to protect against a nonhealth hazard, isolation
protection only, under a backsiphonage condition only.
Vacuum Breaker—Pressure Type. The term "pressure vacuum breaker" means an assembly
containing an independently operating internally loaded check valve and an independently operating loaded
air inlet valve located on the discharge side of the check valve. The assembly is to be equipped with properly
located test cocks and tightly closing shutoff valves attached at each end of the assembly. This assembly is
designed to protect against a health hazard (i.e., contaminant) under a backsiphonage condition only.
Water Purveyor means the owner or operator of a public potable water system, providing an approved
water supply to the public.
Water Supply—Approved. The term "approved water supply" means any public potable water supply
which has been investigated and approved by the state department of environment and natural resources.
The system must be operating under a valid health permit. In determining what constitutes an approved
water supply, the state department of environment and natural resources has reserved the _inal judgment as
to its safety and potability.
Water Supply—Auxiliary. The term "auxiliary water supply" means any water supply on or available
to the premises other than the purveyor's approved public potable water supply. These auxiliary waters may
include water from another purveyor's public potable water supply or any natural source such as a well,
spring, river, stream, etc., "used water", or industrial _luids. These waters may be polluted, contaminated, or
objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor does not have
sanitary control.
Water Supply—Unapproved. The term "unapproved water supply" means a water supply which has
not been approved for human consumption by the state department of environment and natural resources.
Water—Used. The term "used water" means any water supplied by a water purveyor from a public
water system to a consumer's water system after it has passed through the point of delivery and is no longer
under the control of the water purveyor.
(Ord. No. S2008-009, § 1, 7-28-2008)
Sec. 28-235. Right of Entry.
a. Authorized representatives from the public works commission shall have the right to enter, upon
presentation of proper credentials and identi_ication, any building, structure, or premises during normal

online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 459/938
piping systems connected to the public water supply. Where a user has security measures in force which
would require proper identi_ication and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make
necessary arrangements with the security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identi_ication,
public works commission personnel will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of
performing their speci_ic responsibilities. Refusal to allow entry for these purposes may result in
discontinuance of water service.
b. On request, the consumer shall furnish to the commission any pertinent information regarding the water
supply system on such property where cross connections and back_low are deemed possible.
(Ord. No. S2008-009, § 1, 7-28-2008)
Sec. 28-236. Elimina_on of Cross Connec_ons; Degree of Hazard.
a. When cross connections are found to exist, the owner, his agent, occupant, or tenant will be noti_ied in
writing to disconnect the cross connection within the time limit established by the public works
commission. Degree of protection required and maximum time allowed for compliance will be based
upon the potential degree of hazard to the public water supply system. The maximum time limits are as
follows:
1. Cross connections with private wells or other auxiliary water supplies—immediate disconnection.
2. All facilities which pose a health hazard to the potable water system must have a containment
assembly in the form of a reduced pressure principle back_low prevention assembly within 60 days.
3. All industrial and nonresidential facilities not identi_ied as a health hazard shall be considered nonhealth
hazard facilities. All non-health hazard facilities must install, as a minimum containment
assembly, a double check valve assembly within 90 days unless otherwise approved by the public
works commission general manager or his authorized designee.
4. If, in the judgment of the public works commission general manager, an imminent health hazard exists,
water service to the building or premises where a cross connection exists may be terminated unless an
air gap is immediately provided, or the cross connection is immediately eliminated.
5. Lawn irrigation systems are required to have a split tap service or designated lawn irrigation service
tap. The connection of a lawn irrigation system to the service line at any point after the point of
delivery is prohibited.
6. Based upon recommendation from the public works commission, the consumer is responsible for
installing suf_icient internal isolation back_low prevention assemblies and/or methods (i.e., air-gap,
pressure vacuum breakers, reduced pressure principle back_low prevention assembly, double check
valve assembly).
7. Water mains served by the city but not maintained by the public works commission should be
considered cross connections, with degree of hazard to be determined by the public works
commission. Degree of protection shall be based upon the degree of hazard, as determined by the
public works commission.
8. In the event that a public works commission cross connection control inspector does not have
suf_icient access to every portion of a private water system (e.g., classi_ied research and development
facilities; federal government property) to allow a complete evaluation of the degree of hazard
associated with such private water systems, an approved reduced pressure principle assembly shall be
required as a minimum of protection.
9. Customers shall not modify their private water system in a manner that would affect the degree of
hazard of such system until the public works commission has been provided with information showing
that the appropriate back_low prevention assembly is installed, if such modi_ication or change is
determined by the public works commission to require the installation of a different back_low
prevention assembly, the required back_low prevention assembly must be installed in accordance with
provision of this article prior to making the proposed modi_ication or change.
b. No person shall _ill special use tanks or tankers containing pesticides, fertilizers, other toxic chemicals or
their residues from the public water system except at a location equipped with an air gap or an approved
reduced pressure principle back_low prevention assembly properly installed on the public water supply.

a. Testing of back_low prevention assemblies shall be made by a certi_ied back_low prevention assembly
tester or may be contracted out to the public works commission cross connection control department at
the customer's expense. Such tests are to be conducted upon installation and annually thereafter or at a
frequency established by the public works commission's regulations. A record of all testing and repairs is
to be retained by the customer. Copies of the records must be provided to the public works commission's
system protection department within ten business days after the completion of any testing and/or repair
work.
b. Any time that repairs to back_low prevention assemblies are deemed necessary, whether through annual
or required testing or routine inspection by the owner or by the public works commission, these repairs
must be completed within a speci_ied time in accordance with the degree of hazard. In no case shall this
time period exceed:
1. Health hazard facilities, 14 days
2. Non-health hazard facilities, 21 days
c. All back_low prevention assemblies with test cocks are required to be tested annually or at frequency
established by the public works commission's regulations. Testing requires a water shutdown usually
lasting _ive to 20 minutes. For facilities that require an uninterrupted supply of water, and when it is not
possible to provide water service from two separate meters, provisions shall be made for a parallel
installation of back_low prevention assemblies.
d. All certi_ied back_low prevention assembly testers must obtain and employ back_low prevention assembly
test equipment which has been evaluated and/or approved by the public works commission. All test
equipment shall be registered with the public works commission cross connection control department.
All test equipment shall be checked for accuracy annually, at a minimum, calibrated, if necessary, and
certi_ied to the public works commission as to such accuracy/calibration, employing a calibration method
acceptable to the public works commission (see subsection 28-233(e)).
e. It shall be unlawful for any customer or certi_ied tester to submit any record to the public works
commission which is false or incomplete in any material respect. It shall be unlawful for any customer or

public works commission has identi_ied as having a potential for back_low.
b. The following types of facilities or services have been identi_ied by the public works commission as
having a potential for back_low of nonpotable water into the public water supply system. Therefore, an
approved back_low prevention assembly will be required on all such services according to the degree of
hazard present. Other types of facilities or services not listed below may also be required to install
approved back_low prevention assemblies if determined necessary by the public works commission. As a
minimum requirement, all nonresidential services will be required to install a double check valve
assembly, unless otherwise listed in this subsection. The installation of an approved back_low prevention
assembly or method other than those speci_ied by this article can be allowed only by the approval of the
public works commission general manager or his authorized representative.

stormwater control requirements of the project shall not exceed that allowed for the critical area or
balance of watershed, whichever applies.
2. All built-upon area shall be designed and located to minimize stormwater runoff impact to the receiving
waters and minimize concentrated stormwater _low.
3. The remainder of the tract shall remain in a vegetated or natural state. Where the development has an
incorporated property owners association, the title of the open space area shall be conveyed to the
association in fee simple for management. Where a property association is not incorporated, a
maintenance agreement shall be _iled with the property deeds in the of_ice of the county register of deeds.

shall include the following information:
1. A site plan, drawn to scale of at least one inch to 40 feet, indicating the property lines of the parcel
upon which the use is proposed; any existing or proposed structures; parking areas and other built3/
20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 494/938
upon areas; surface water drainage. The site plan shall be neatly drawn and indicate north point, name
and address of person who prepared the plan, date of the original drawing, and an accurate record of
any later revisions.
2. A complete and detailed description of the proposed variance, together with any other pertinent
information which the applicant feels would be helpful to the public works commission in considering
the application.
b. Before the public works commission may grant a variance, it shall make the following _indings, which
shall be recorded in the permanent record of the case and shall include the factual reasons on which they
are based:
1. There are practical dif_iculties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of
the chapter. In order to determine that there are practical dif_iculties or unnecessary hardships, the
public works commission must _ind the _ive following conditions exist:
a. If the applicant complies with the provisions of this chapter, the applicant can secure no reasonable
return from, nor make reasonable use of, his property. Merely providing that the variance would
permit a greater pro_it to be made from the property will not be considered adequate to justify the
commission in granting a variance. Moreover, the public works commission shall consider whether
the variance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of this chapter that will make
possible the reasonable use of his property.
b. The hardship results from the application of this chapter to the property rather than from other
factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship.
c. The hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's property, such as its size, shape or
topography, which is different from that of neighboring property.
d. The hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or unknowingly violates
this chapter, or who purchases the property after the effective date of the ordinance from which this
chapter is derived, and then comes to the public works commission for relief.
e. The hardship is peculiar to the applicant's property, rather than the result of conditions that are
widespread. If other properties are equally subject to the hardship created in the restriction, then
granting a variance would be a special privilege denied to others, and would not promote equal
justice.
2. The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter and preserves its spirit.
3. In the granting of the variance, the public safety and welfare have been assured and substantial justice
has been done. The public works commission shall not grant a variance if it _inds that doing so would
in any respect impair the public health, safety, or general welfare.
c. In granting the variance, the public works commission may attach thereto such conditions regarding the
location, character, and other features of the proposed building, structure, or use as it may deem advisable
in furtherance of the purpose of this chapter. If the variance for the construction, alteration or use of
property is granted, such construction, alteration or use shall be in accordance with the approved site
plan.
d. The public works commission shall refuse to hear an appeal or an application for a variance previously
denied if it _inds that there have been no substantial changes in conditions or circumstances bearing on
the appeal or application.
e. A variance issued in accordance with this section shall be considered a watershed protection permit and
shall expire if a building permit or watershed occupancy permit for such use is not obtained by the
applicant within six months from the date of the decision.
f. If the application calls for the granting of a major variance, and if the public works commission decides in
favor of granting the variance, the public works commission shall prepare a preliminary record of the
hearing with all deliberate speed.
1. The preliminary record of the hearing shall include:
a. The variance application;
b. The hearing notices;

c. The evidence presented;
d. Motions, offers of proof, objections to evidence, and rulings on them;
e. Proposed _indings and expectations;
f. The proposed decision, including all conditions proposed to be added to the permit.

3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 507/938
The Of_icial Zoning Map designates the location and boundaries of the various base zoning and overlay
zoning districts established in this Ordinance. The Of_icial Zoning Map shall be kept on _ile in the Planning
and Zoning Division and is available for public inspection during normal business hours. The original of_icial
version of the map shall be certi_ied by the City Manager. It may be kept in either hardcopy or digital form. It
shall be the _inal authority as to the status of the current zoning district classi_ication of land in the City, and
shall only be amended in accordance with this Ordinance. In accordance with Section 160A-22 of the North
Carolina General Statutes, the City Clerk shall certify the Of_icial Zoning Map for use as evidence in a court of
law.
30-1.G.2. Incorporated by Reference
The Of_icial Zoning Map and all the notations thereon is incorporated herein by reference and made part of
this Ordinance.
30-1.G.3. Zoning Classifica_on of Lands Added to Jurisdic_on
a. City Council Determination The City Council shall determine the zoning designation of lands added to
the City's jurisdiction through annexation at the time such lands are added, based on the following
factors:
1. The land's designation on adopted plans addressing the City's growth and development;
2. The land's current land use;
3. The existence of a previously-approved site or subdivision plan;
4. The character of adjacent lands;
5. Current County zoning classi_ications;
6. Landowner requests; and
7. Other factors considered relevant at the time of the annexation.
b. Relationship to Voluntary Annexation Requests Where an area is proposed to be added to the City's
jurisdiction through a landowner's petition for voluntary annexation, the landowner may submit an
application for a Map Amendment (Rezoning) (see Section 30-2.C.1) requesting a speci_ic base zoning
district classi_ication along with the annexation petition. In such a case, the public hearing for the Map
Amendment (Rezoning) application may be held concurrently with any public hearing required for the
annexation.
c. Relationship to Involuntary Annexation Where an area is proposed to be added to the City's
jurisdiction through the involuntary annexation process, a landowner may submit an application for a
Map Amendment (Rezoning) (see Section 30-2.C.1) requesting a speci_ic base zoning district
classi_ication that is equal to or less intense than the existing County base zoning designation for
consideration following annexation.
30-1.G.4. Interpreta_on of Official Map Boundaries
The City Manager shall be responsible for interpretations of the Of_icial Zoning Map in accordance with the
standards in Section 30-2.C.17, Interpretation, and the following standards:
a. Boundaries shown as approximately following a utility line or a street, alley, railroad, or other public
access way shall be interpreted as following the centerline of the right-of-way or easement for the utility
line or access way.
b. Boundaries shown as approximately following a property line shall be interpreted as following the
property line as it existed when the boundary was established. If a subsequent minor adjustment (such as
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 508/938
from settlement of a boundary dispute or overlap) results in the property line moving ten feet or less, the
zoning boundary shall be interpreted as moving with the property line.
c. Boundaries shown as approximately following a river, stream, canal, lake, or other watercourse shall be
interpreted as following the centerline of the watercourse as it actually exists, and as moving with that
centerline to the extent the watercourse moves as a result of natural processes (_looding, erosion,
sedimentation, etc.).
d. Boundaries shown as approximately following established municipal corporate limits or other political
boundaries shall be interpreted as following the corporate limits or boundary.
e. Boundaries shown parallel to or as extensions of features indicated in this subsection shall be interpreted
as such.
f. If the speci_ic location of a depicted boundary cannot be determined from notations on the Of_icial Zoning
Map or application of the above standards, it shall be determined by using the map's scale to determine
the boundary's distance from other features shown on the map.
Figure 30-1.G.4: Zoning Line Interpreta_on
This diagram depicts how exis_ng zoning is applied to new lands based upon the extension of exis_ng features or
zoning classifica_ons.
g. Where the actual locations of existing physical or natural features vary from that shown on the Of_icial
Zoning Map, or in other circumstances not covered by this subsection, the City Manager shall have the
authority to interpret the district boundaries (see Section 30-2.C.17, Interpretation). Appeals of the City
Manager's decision shall be reviewed by the Zoning Commission in accordance with Section 30-2.C.18,
Appeal.
(Ord. No. S2012-025, § 16, 11-13-2012; Ord. No S2015-018, § 1, 12-14-2015)
30-1.G.5. Changes to Official Zoning Map
Changes made in zoning district boundaries or other matters portrayed on the Of_icial Zoning Map shall be
made in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance (Section 30-2.C.1, Map Amendment (Rezoning)).
Changes shall be entered on the Of_icial Zoning Map by the City Manager promptly after the amendment is
approved by the City Council. Where the ordinance enacting a zoning district boundary change contains
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 509/938
wording explaining or clarifying the location of the new boundary, the City Manager may enter on the Of_icial
Zoning Map notations re_lecting the ordinance wording. The City Manager shall maintain copies of
superseded versions of the Of_icial Zoning Map for historical reference.
30-1.G.6. Transi_on to New Zoning Districts
On July 1, 2011, land zoned with a zoning district classi_ication from the previous zoning regulations shall be
translated or reclassi_ied to one of the zoning district classi_ications in this Ordinance as set forth in Article
30-3: Zoning Districts. Table 30-1.G.6, Zoning District Transition Table, summarizes the translation or
reclassi_ication of the zoning districts used in the previous zoning regulations to the zoning districts used in

NOTES
1. Lands designated one of the "Former Zoning District" classifica_ons shown in the le?? column are translated or reclassified to the

2. Uses allowed in the former C1 or C1P Districts are now permi??ed in either the NC, LC, or CC district based upon the intensity and the
level of automobile orienta_on of the use. Uses with a higher degree of intensity or automobile orienta_on are permi??ed in the CC
district and may require approval of a Special Use Permit or are prohibited in the NC and LC districts.
3. Uses allowed in the former C3 District are permi??ed in either the CC or LI districts based upon the intensity and the level of
automobile orienta_on of the use.
4. Land in this former condi_onal use zoning district retains its MU-C district classifica_on and remains subject to the approved Site Plan
and condi_ons associated with the Map Amendment establishing that MU-C zoning classifica_on.
5. Land in the Planned Neighborhood Development district developed prior to July 1, 2011, subject to an approved master plan shall
retain its PND designa_on and remain subject to the approved master plan, detailed Site Plan, any Subdivision Plans and condi_ons of

amended.
30-1.H.2. Viola_ons Con_nues
Any violation of the previous zoning regulations or subdivision regulations shall continue to be a violation
under this Ordinance and any other applicable ordinances, laws, or statutes. Violations of this Ordinance

PD district occurs through the Site Plan and Subdivision Plan
review procedures (whichever is appropriate), which ensure
compliance with the approved master plan and terms and
conditions.
c. Initiation

30-2.C.4. Condi_onal Rezoning
a. Purpose
In cases where the standards of a general use (base) zoning district are inadequate to ensure that
development allowed by the district will conform to the City's adopted plans or to appropriately address
the impacts expected to be generated by such development, a landowner may apply for a Conditional
Rezoning. Such rezoning establishes a conditional zoning district that is equivalent to the general use
(base) zoning district, but subject to additional conditions or restrictions that the applicant and the City
mutually agree are necessary to ensure conformance to adopted plans and adequately address expected
development impacts. The purpose of this section is to provide a uniform means for amending the Of_icial
Zoning Map to establish conditional zoning districts.

a. Purpose and Intent
It is the purpose of this section to promote and protect the health, safety and general welfare and enhance
the quality of life in Fayetteville by providing guidance and regulation in the removal of trees on any
development site. This section is intended to ensure that prior to proceeding with development activities,
such as clearing and grubbing of a site or other signi_icant land-disturbing activities taking place on land
not yet subject to an approved Site Plan, Subdivision Plan, or Building Permit, the property owner shall be
made aware of the substantial bene_its of trees and the substantial cost savings in retaining on-site trees
that will meet the City's development regulations for the establishment of a tree save area over the cost of
having to replant and restore a portion of what was unknowingly removed.
The purpose of a Clear-Cutting Permit is to:
1. Retain signi_icant trees that contribute to the city's visual and aesthetic quality and ensure that
signi_icant trees are not unknowingly eliminated without appropriate consideration;
2. Ensure that the property owner is made aware of the value existing trees give to a development and
the substantial cost savings associated with retaining trees that will meet the City's development
regulations over the cost of having to replant and restore a portion of what was unknowingly removed;
3. Retain a buffer of naturally existing vegetation along all boundaries of the property to protect adjacent
properties from harmful effects and exposure unless it is the intent of the applicant to submit a site
plan, subdivision plan or building permit within six months of the clearing;
4. Retain a percentage of tree canopy in furtherance of the city's effort to maintain and restore tree
canopy coverage across the city;
5. Enhance air and water quality;
6. Minimize heat and noise impacts; and
7. Minimize soil erosion and _looding.
b. Applicability

circumstances to relieve undue and unique hardships to the landowner. No change in permitted uses or
applicable conditions of approval may be authorized by Variance.

A Variance application shall be approved only upon a _inding that all of the following standards are met:
1. Strict application of the Ordinance requirements results in practical dif_iculties and unnecessary
hardships; it shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable
use can be made of the property; and
2. Any practical dif_iculties or unnecessary hardships result from unique circumstances related to the
land, such as location, size, or topography, and are not the result of the actions of the landowner, nor
may hardships resulting from personal circumstances as well as hardships resulting from conditions
that are common to the neighborhood or the general public be the basis for granting a variance; and
3. The Variance is the minimum action that will make possible a reasonable use of land or structures; and
4. The Variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this Ordinance and preserves its
spirit; and
5. In the granting of the Variance, the public safety and welfare have been assured and substantial justice

permits required by this Ordinance or any other applicable provisions of the City. A Variance shall not
ensure that the development receiving a Variance receives subsequent approval for other applications for

the landowner demonstrates that, owing to special circumstances or conditions beyond the landowner's
control (such as exceptional topographical conditions, narrowness, shallowness, or the shape of a speci_ic
parcel of land), the literal application of the standards would result in undue and unique hardship to the
landowner and the deviation would not be contrary to the public interest. Subdivision Waivers are to be

is established as a condition of approval, the
Administrative Adjustment shall expire upon the lapse of
the allowable time frame, regardless of (b) and (c) below.
2. If a Building Permit is required, the Administrative
Adjustment shall automatically expire if the Building
Permit is not issued within six months after the date of
issuance of the Administrative Adjustment.

Administrative Adjustment shall automatically expire if
the activity authorized by the Administrative Adjustment
is not commenced within six months of the date of
approval of the Administrative Adjustment.
e. Administrative Adjustment Standards
Administrative Adjustments shall be approved only upon a
_inding that the following standards are met:
1. General
The requested Administrative Adjustment is not inconsistent with the character or intent of
development in the surrounding area, and will not result in incompatible uses or unreasonable
negative impacts.
2. Mitigates Adverse Impacts
Any adverse impacts resulting from the Administrative Adjustment will be mitigated, to the maximum
extent practicable.
3. Technical Nature
The Administrative Adjustment is of a technical nature (i.e., relief from a dimensional or design
standard), and is:
a. Required to compensate for some unusual aspect of the site or the proposed development that is
not shared by landowners in general;
b. Supporting an objective or goal from the purpose and intent statements of the zoning district where
located;
c. Meeting the intent and effect of the separation otherwise required between two uses dues to
topographical or other circumstances related to the speci_ic situation; or
d. Proposed to save healthy existing trees.

3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 575/938
landowner has attempted to develop a street design that complies with the connectivity index to the
maximum extent practicable, but it is reasonably impossible, due to either:
a. Topographical or environmental conditions; or
b. The limited number of external connections to the site, and the physical features of the site.
6. Commercial, Of_ice, and Mixed-Use Design Standards and Large Retail Development
Commercial, Of_ice, and Mixed-Use Design Standards and Large Retail design standards may be
adjusted when it is determined that the Administrative Adjustment will result in new development
that is more consistent with the goals of the comprehensive plan and the purpose and intent of this
Chapter than would otherwise result from a strict application of the design standards in Section 30-5.I.,
Commercial, Of_ice and Mixed-Use Design Standards, and Section 30-5.J., Large Retail Design
Standards.
f. Subsequent Development
Development authorized by the Administrative Adjustment shall not be carried out until the applicant has
secured all other permits required by this Ordinance or any other applicable provisions of the City. An
Administrative Adjustment shall not ensure that the development receiving an Administrative
Adjustment receives subsequent approval for other applications for development unless the relevant and
applicable portions of this Ordinance or any other applicable provisions are met.
g. Effect of Approval
Approval of an Administrative Adjustment shall authorize only the particular Administrative Adjustment
that is approved. An Administrative Adjustment, including any conditions, shall run with the land and not
be affected by a change in ownership.
h. Amendment
An Administrative Adjustment may be amended, extended, or modi_ied only in accordance with the
procedures and standards established for its original approval.

3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 580/938
application for the Building Permit is not submitted within
two years after the date the Site Plan or Subdivision Plan is
approved, if no extensions are granted.
b. In cases where a Building Permit is not required to
undertake the development authorized by the approval for
which a Vested Rights Certi_icate is issued, the Vested Rights

commenced within two years after the date the Site Plan or
Subdivision Plan is approved.
e. Vested Rights Certi_icate Standards
A Vested Rights Certi_icate shall be approved and issued in
accordance with this section only upon a _inding that the
following standards have been met:
1. The application requests a Vested Rights Certi_icate for

30-2.C.20. Development Agreement
a. Purpose
The purpose of this section is to establish standards and procedures for the City entering into
Development Agreements for long-term, large-scale developments, in recognition of the following
_indings and statements of intent:
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 581/938
1. Large-Scale Development Projects and Long-Term Commitment of Resources
Large-scale development projects often occur in multiple phases extending over a period of years,
requiring a long-term commitment of both public and private resources.
2. Potential Community Impacts
Such large-scale developments often create potential community impacts and potential opportunities
that are dif_icult or impossible to accommodate within traditional zoning processes.
3. Careful Integration between Public Capital Facilities Planning, Financing, Schedules
Because of their scale and duration, such large-scale projects often require careful integration between
public capital facilities planning, _inancing, and construction schedules and the phasing of the private
development.
4. Stable Development Standards
Because of their scale and duration, such large-scale projects involve substantial commitments of
private capital by private developers, which private developers are unwilling to risk without suf_icient
assurances that development standards will remain stable through the extended period of the
development.
5. Nontraditional Development Types
Because of their size and duration, such developments often permit communities and developers to
experiment with different or nontraditional types of development concepts and standards, while still
managing the impacts on the surrounding areas.
6. Negotiating Flexibility
To better structure and manage development approvals for such large-scale developments and ensure
their proper integration into local capital facilities programs, local governments need the _lexibility in
negotiating such developments.
7. Plan Consistency
In negotiating for such developments, it is the intent of the City to remain consistent with the adopted
plans, policies, and goals of the City as they relate to land use and capital improvements.
b. Authority
The City may enter into a Development Agreement with a developer, subject to the procedures and
standards of this section. In entering into such a Development Agreement, the City may not exercise any
authority or make any commitment not authorized by general or local act, and may not impose any tax or
fee not authorized by otherwise applicable law. If more than one local government is made party to an
agreement, the agreement must specify which local government is responsible for the overall
administration of the Development Agreement.
c. Relationship to Prior Development Approvals
Although an application for a Development Agreement generally is submitted and reviewed before, or in
conjunction with, the _irst development approval required for the proposed development (e.g., Planned
Development), such an application may be submitted and decided at any stage of the development. If the
application is submitted after development approvals have been granted, either the Development
Agreement should incorporate the terms and conditions of those prior approvals or any approval of the
Development Agreement shall be contingent upon any amendments to those prior approvals necessary to
ensure conformance between the Development Agreement and applicable development approvals.
d. Initiation
An application for a Development Agreement may be initiated by any person who may submit
applications in accordance with Section , Authority to File Applications.
e. Procedure
1. Basic Procedures
Except as modi_ied by Sections , Common Review Procedures.

development, including who provides the facilities, the
date any new public facilities, if needed, will be
constructed, and a schedule to assure public facilities are
available concurrent with the impacts of the
development.
6. If the Development Agreement provides that the City
shall provide certain public facilities, the Development
Agreement shall provide that the delivery date of such
public facilities will be tied to successful performance by
the developer in implementing the proposed
development (such as meeting de_ined completion
percentages or other performance standards).
7. A description, where appropriate, of any reservation or
dedication of land for public purposes and any
provisions to protect environmentally sensitive property.
8. A description of all local development permits approved
or needed to be approved for the development of the
property together with a statement indicating that the
failure of the agreement to address a particular permit,
condition, term, or restriction does not relieve the
developer of the necessity of complying with the law
governing their permitting requirements, conditions,
terms, or restrictions.
9. A description of any conditions, terms, restrictions, or
other requirements determined to be necessary by the
local government for the public health, safety, or welfare

3. Other matters not inconsistent with law.
c. The application shall include a master plan that depicts the general con_iguration and relationship
of the principal elements of the proposed development, including major uses, general building
types, pedestrian and vehicular circulation, open space, public facilities, and phasing.
3. Review and Report by City Manager

Regardless of the other provisions of this Article, the Planning Commission may, in its sole discretion,
approve a Neighborhood Compatibility Permit for certain development projects which may include zero
lot line developments, adaptive reuse projects and cottage development proposals that differ in scale or
character from the surrounding neighborhood but because of their design or context are determined to
be compatible with the neighborhood.
c. Applicability.
Neighborhood Compatibility Permit applications may be submitted for the following types of
development: certain zero lot line developments on parcels containing three or less acres in area,
adaptive reuse projects, cottage developments, and parking of multi-axle trailers in front or corner side
yards in residential districts.

30-3.A. General Provisions
30-3.A.1. Types of Zoning Districts
Land within the City is generally classi_ied by this Ordinance to be within one of a number of base zoning
districts. Land may be reclassi_ied to one of a number of comparable conditional zoning districts in
accordance with Section 30-2.C.4, Conditional Rezoning, or to one of several planned development zoning
districts in accordance with Section 30-2.C.3, Planned Development. Land within any base, conditional, or
planned development zoning district may also be classi_ied into one or more overlay zoning districts, in
which case regulations governing development in the overlay district shall apply in addition to the
regulations governing development in the underlying base zoning district, conditional zoning district, or
planned development zoning district.
30-3.A.2. Compliance with District Standards
No land within the City shall be developed except in accordance with the zoning district regulations of this
article and all other regulations of this Ordinance, including but not limited to, Article 4: Use Standards,

Land shall be classi_ied or reclassi_ied into a base zoning district only in accordance with the procedures
and requirements set forth in Section 30-2.C.1, Map Amendment (Rezoning).
b. Relationship to Overlay Zoning Districts
Regulations governing development in an overlay zoning district shall apply in addition to the regulations
governing development in the underlying base zoning district. If the standards governing a base zoning
district expressly con_lict with those governing an overlay zoning district, the standards governing the
overlay zoning district shall control.
c. Organization of Base Zoning District Regulations
Sections 30-3.C through 30-3.E set out the general purposes of each group of base zoning districts and
contain subsections that set out the speci_ic purpose, bulk, and dimensional standards for each individual
base zoning district. These subsections have a common structure consisting of a purpose statement,
applicable dimensional standards, a photograph showing a hypothetical preferred building form for the

online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 589/938
district, a graphic depiction of hypothetical street layout and lot patterns, and a hypothetical graphic
depiction of the district's bulk and dimensional standards as applied to typical lot patterns and building
forms. The building form photographs and lot pattern diagrams are for illustrative purposes only, and
may not be consistent with all the dimensional requirements. In these cases, the dimensional
requirements text of this Ordinance shall control. Article 30-4: Use Standards, includes Table 30-4.A, Use
Table, a summary use table specifying permitted, special, and allowable uses for each of the base zoning
districts and references any standards speci_ic to individual uses.
(Ord. No. S2012-024, § 2, 11-13-2012)
30-3.B.2. Zero Lot Line Applicability
In addition to traditional development, this Ordinance also allows zero lot line development in the
agricultural, residential and business districts to provide _lexibility in lot layout for greater development
ef_iciency and density and/or in addressing site constraints. The zero lot line standards are allowed in the
districts identi_ied in Section 30-3.B.2.a, Applicability and subject to meeting certain conditions. Zero lot line
development is subject to review and approval of a Major Site Plan (see Section 30-2.C.5). Zero lot line
development on a tract or site smaller than three acres also requires a Special Use Permit (see Section 30-
2.C.7). Zero lot line development is subject to all applicable use standards (Article 30-4), subdivision
requirements (Article 30-6), and applicable design and development standards (Article 30-5).
a. Applicability
1. Districts
Zero lot line development is allowed in the agricultural, residential and business (AR, SF-15, SF-10, SF-
6, MR-5, OI, NC, LC, CC, MU, and BP, LI and HI) zoning districts subject to speci_ic conditions noted
below.
b. Procedure
1. Major Site Plan Required
All applications for zero lot line development shall be reviewed as a Major Site Plan in accordance with
the procedures and requirements in Section 30-2.C.5, Site Plan.
2. Simultaneous Review
The review of the application for a Major Site Plan, Special Use Permit, Conditional Zoning or
Neighborhood Compatibility Permit (if required), and Alternative Plans (landscaping or parking, as
may be applicable), or Administrative Adjustment, if requested, shall be conducted simultaneously, to
the maximum extent possible.
c. Standards
1. Density
Zero lot line development shall comply with the maximum allowable gross density and maximum
height requirements in the base zoning district where proposed, and the following standards:
2. Required Setbacks
Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, lots and yard setbacks internal to a zero lot line
development may deviate from the minimum yard and lot area requirements, but perimeter lots must
meet the front and corner side setbacks of the underlying zoning district. However, setbacks
associated with an overlay district or any applicable setbacks from natural resources shall apply to all
lots within a zero lot line development.
3. Compliance with Design Standards
All zero lot line development regardless of size (number of units) shall comply with all applicable
development standards in Article 30-5: Development Standards, including the Single-Family, Multi-
Family, Commercial, Of_ice, and Mixed-Use, Large Retail, and Transitional Standards in Article 30-5:
Development Standards, as applicable.
4. Conditions for residential development:
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 590/938
a. Orientation: Except as provided below, all dwellings on the exterior of a ZLL development that
adjoin an existing street shall be oriented so that the front façade faces the adjoining street. In the
case of corner lots, the front façade shall face the street from which the dwelling derives its street
address. A dwelling may be designed to have more than one “front façade.”
Exception (requires a Neighborhood Compatibility Permit for developments on a tract or site
smaller than three acres): When rear or side yards face the adjoining existing street(s), a Type ‘A’
Property Perimeter Buffer (see Table 30-5.B.4.D.4.) shall be provided along the affected street(s).
Any fences or walls installed shall be interior to this buffer and shall comply with the design
standards of Article 30-5 for fences and walls. Gates or openings in such fences and walls may be
provided for access purposes, including maintenance. Such buffers shall be shown on any _inal
plans, plats or deeds, as applicable.
b. Parking: Vehicle Use Areas on perimeter lots in single-family districts and small multifamily
projects shall not exceed 50 percent of the area between the street right-of-way and the front façade
of the structure(s).
c. Neighborhood Context: When a ZLL development is proposed on a tract or site smaller than three
acres along a street where the median platted lot size of the lots adjoining the street in the block in
which the development is proposed is 200% or more than the minimum lot size of the underlying
zoning district(s), a Neighborhood Compatibility Permit shall be required.
d. Tiered Development: When a ZLL development is proposed with principal structures located
behind other principal structures that front on adjoining streets and such principal structures are
not “shielded” by the frontage structures for 25% or more than the length of the frontage, excluding
the width of drives or streets, a Neighborhood Compatibility Permit is required on a tract or site
smaller than three acres, except when the affected street or streets are four lanes or more in width.

10 DISTRICT
PURPOSE
The Single-Family Residen_al 10 (SF-10) District is established to accommodate principally single-family detached
residen_al development at low densi_es, and to accommodate flexibly-designed residen_al development that provides
variable housing types and arrangements that respond to environmental and site condi_ons. Uses within the district are
subject to the design standards in Ar_cle 30-5: Development Standards. The district accommodates two- to four-family
dwellings designed to appear as single-family detached homes and zero lot line development subject to the requirements
of this Ordinance. District regula_ons discourage any use that substan_ally interferes with the development of singlefamily
dwellings and that is detrimental to the quiet residen_al nature of the district. Also allowed are complementary
uses usually found in residen_al zoning districts, such as parks, open space, minor u_li_es, accessory dwellings of up to
800 square feet in size, schools, and places of worship.

30-3.E. Business Base Zoning Districts
30-3.E.1. General Purposes
The business base zoning districts are established for the general purpose of ensuring there are lands in the
City that provide a wide range of of_ice, retail, service, industrial, and related uses to meet household and
business needs, and more speci_ically to:
a. Provide appropriately located lands for the full range of business uses needed by the City's residents,
businesses, and workers, consistent with the goals, objectives, and policies of the 2030 Joint Growth
Vision Plan, the Cumberland County Land Use Plan, functional plans, and applicable small area plans;
b. Strengthen the City's economic base, and provide employment opportunities close to home for residents
of the City and surrounding communities;
c. Create suitable environments for various types of business uses, and protect them from the adverse
effects of incompatible uses;
d. Create suitable environments for various types of mixed use development, where business, of_ice, retail,
and residential uses are designed and integrated in compatible ways;
e. Support the military and governmental activities taking place in the vicinity;
f. Preserve the unique character and historic resources of the downtown; and
g. Minimize the impact of business development on residential districts and uses.

The Office and Ins_tu_onal (OI) District is established and intended to accommodate a mix of small-scale, low-intensity
professional and business offices and ins_tu_ons, together with limited personal service and suppor_ng retail uses (See
30-4.D Accessory Uses) , single-family detached, single-family a??ached, and mul_-family residen_al uses in close
proximity to one another, subject to design and compa_bility standards. The districts are generally near residen_al
neighborhoods and o??en serve as a buffer or transi_on between neighborhoods and more intense business districts.
Uses in the district are subject to the design standards in Ar_cle 30-5: Development Standards. In many cases, OI districts
are evolving from land that was once primarily residen_al in character, and as such, office and ins_tu_onal uses should be
configured for consistency with surrounding residen_al uses in physical design, scale, and character.

The Neighborhood Commercial (NC) District is established and intended to accommodate small-scale, low-intensity, and
"convenience" retail and service uses that provide goods and services serving the residents of the immediately
surrounding neighborhood (e.g., personal service uses, small restaurants, and limited retail). Development in the district
should not include uses of a size that is out of scale with a residen_al neighborhood, or that a??racts traffic from outside
the surrounding neighborhood. New construc_on shall not create individual retail uses over 2,500 square feet without
obtaining a Special Use Permit (See Sec_on 30-2.C.7.). Residen_al uses are encouraged on the upper floors of
nonresiden_al establishments. The district is subject to standards intended to ensure development is consistent with
the neighborhood scale and compa_ble with surrounding uses and the design standards in Ar_cle 30-5: Development
Standards.

DISTRICT
PURPOSE
The Limited Commercial (LC) District is established and intended to accommodate a wider range of moderate-intensity
general retail, business, and service uses that serve groups of neighborhoods instead of just an individual neighborhood—
e.g., grocery stores, drugstores, large restaurants, gas sta_ons, and higher order retail uses like specialty stores. The
district is not intended to accommodate intensive commercial or other business uses. Residen_al uses are encouraged on
the upper floors of nonresiden_al establishments. The district is subject to standards intended to ensure development is
compa_ble with surrounding residen_al neighborhoods.

PURPOSE
The Community Commercial (CC) District is established and intended to accommodate a diverse range of medium- to
high-intensity retail, service, and office uses that provide goods and services serving the residents and businesses in the
community at large—e.g., shopping centers, convenience stores, retail sales establishments, and heavier commercial uses
(subject to approval of a Special Use Permit (see Sec_on 30-2.C.7)). The district is typically located along major arterials, at
the intersec_on of arterials, and along growth corridors iden_fied in City plans. Higher-density residen_al uses are
encouraged on the upper floors of nonresiden_al establishments, and may exist as stand-alone buildings as part of a
larger horizontal mixed- use development. The district is subject to standards intended to ensure development is
compa_ble with surrounding uses as well as the design standards in Ar_cle 30-5: Development Standards.

PURPOSE
The Mixed-Use (MU) District is established and intended to accommodate and foster the coordinated development of a
compa_ble and balanced mix of mutually suppor_ng living, working, shopping, educa_ng, entertainment, and recrea_ng
uses. By providing housing close to nonresiden_al uses and grouping mul_ple des_na_ons, such mixed-used development
reduces vehicle usage and creates a compact high-quality, pedestrian-oriented environment. The district is subject to
flexible standards intended to encourage an appropriate scale and balance of uses and development to ensure district
development is compa_ble with surrounding uses. Uses may be either ver_cally-integrated within a single building or
horizontally-integrated within separate buildings on the same site. Developments proposed within the MU District that do
not include a mix of uses require a Special Use Permit (See Sec_on 30-2.C.7).

The Downtown (DT) District is established and intended to encourage the urban form and architectural character found in
the tradi_onal downtown area as well as promote redevelopment that will make the downtown area a more diverse and
vibrant mixed- use urban center. The district encompasses the same area as the Downtown Municipal Service District and
the downtown historic districts. The district is intended to accommodate a well-balanced mix of uses (including more
high-density residen_al development), promote a stronger pedestrian-oriented environment (with a reduced need for
parking), and preserve and protect the downtown's historical and architectural scale and character. Uses that will add
ac_vity in the downtown a??er 5:00 p.m. are encouraged. The district is subject to flexible and incen_ve-based standards

(Ord. No. S2012-024, § 4, 11-13-2012)
30-3.F.2. Purpose
The rezoning of land to a conditional zoning district is intended to provide a landowner and the City an
alternative to rezoning the land to a standard base zoning district, where the base zoning district allows
certain uses and development that may be appropriate but also allows uses and development that may not
conform to City plans or would have adverse impacts on public facilities or surrounding lands.
Reclassi_ication of land to a conditional zoning district allows a landowner to propose, and the City Council to
consider, additional conditions or restrictions on the range of allowable uses, use standards, development
intensities, development standards, and other regulations applicable in the parallel base zoning district. This
enables the City to tailor a zoning classi_ication to accommodate desirable development while avoiding or
addressing anticipated problems that may arise from development otherwise allowed by the base zoning
district.
30-3.F.3. Classifica_on of Condi_onal Zoning Districts
Land shall be classi_ied into a conditional zoning district only in accordance with the procedures and
requirements set forth in Section 30-2.C.4, Conditional Rezoning.
30-3.F.4. Applicable Regula_ons
Development in a conditional zoning district shall be subject to all the use and development standards and
requirements that apply to development in the parallel base zoning district, plus the conditions imposed as
part of the Conditional Rezoning approval, which may not be less restrictive than the regulations for the
parallel base zoning district.
30-3.F.5. Rela_onship to Overlay Zoning Districts
Regulations governing development in an overlay zoning district shall apply in addition to the regulations
governing development in the underlying conditional zoning district. If the standards governing a
conditional zoning district expressly con_lict with those governing an overlay zoning district, the standards
governing the overlay district shall control.
30-3.F.6. Applied to En_re Lot
No application for conditional rezoning (see Section 30-2.C.4) may split an existing site or lot of record into a
conditional zoning district and a base zoning district. Nothing in this subsection shall limit a conditional
rezoning that splits a lot or site into two or more different conditional zoning district designations.

DISTRICT ABBREVIATION DISTRICT NAME
PD-R Planned Development - Residen_al
PD-EC Planned Development - Employment Center
PD-TN Planned Development - Tradi_onal Neighborhood Development
b. General Planned Development District Purposes
The Planned Development (PD) districts are established and intended to encourage innovative land
planning and site design concepts that support a high quality of life and achieve a high quality of
development, environmental sensitivity, energy ef_iciency, and other City goals and objectives by:
1. Reducing or diminishing the in_lexibility or uniform design that sometimes results from strict
application of zoning and development standards designed primarily for individual lots;
2. Allowing greater freedom in selecting the means of providing access, open space, and design
amenities;
3. Allowing greater freedom in providing a well-integrated mix of residential and nonresidential land
uses in the same development, including a mix of housing types, lot sizes, and densities;
4. Providing for ef_icient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets and thereby
lowering development and housing costs;
5. Promoting quality design and environmentally sensitive development that respects surrounding
established land use character and respects and takes advantage of a site's natural and man-made
features, such as trees, streams, hillsides, _loodplains, and historic features; and
6. Establishing a zoning district that corresponds to Cumberland County's Density Development
Conditional Use District within the City's Municipal In_luence Areas.
c. Classi_ication of Planned Development Zoning Districts
Land shall be classi_ied into a planned development zoning district only in accordance with the
procedures and requirements set forth in Section 30-2.C.3, Planned Development, and this section.
d. Relationship to PND District
Lands designated as Planned Neighborhood District (PND) on July 1, 2011 are subject to the standards
and conditions included within the previously-adopted master plans and other requirements related to
their approval. These developments may proceed subject to their original approvals in accordance with
Section 30-1.H, Transitional Provisions. In the event the PND expires, or a modi_ication to the district is
proposed, an applicant may seek to establish a PD district in accordance with this section and Section 30-
2.C.3, Planned Development.
e. Organization of Planned Development Zoning District Regulations
Section 30-3.G.2, General Standards for All Planned Development Districts, sets out general standards
applicable to all types of Planned Development districts. Sections 30-3.G.3 to 30-3.G.5 set out the purpose
statements and standards for each of the three speci_ic types of Planned Development district. These
subsections have a common structure consisting of a purpose statement and applicable development
standards. Some PD districts also include additional district-speci_ic standards. Article 30-4, Use
Standards, includes a summary use table specifying the allowable uses for each of the PD districts (see
Table 30-4.A, Use Table) subject to an approved master plan. Uses that do not include an "MP" under a
particular PD district column in Table 30-4.A are prohibited within that PD district.
30-3.G.2. General Standards for All Planned Development Districts
Before approving a PD zoning district classi_ication, the City Council shall _ind that the application for the PD
zoning district classi_ication, as well as the Master Plan and the Terms and Conditions document included as
part of the application, comply with the following standards:

a. Planned Development Master Plan
The Master Plan shall:
1. Include a statement of planning objectives for the district;
2. Identify the natural features and de_ining characteristics of the site such as site's natural amenities,
signi_icant trees (both individually and in mass), vegetation, and topography;
3. Identify the general location of individual development areas, identi_ied by land use(s) and/or
development density or intensity;
4. Identify for the entire PD district and each development area the acreage, types and mix of land uses,
number of residential units (by use type), nonresidential _loor area (by use type), residential density,
and nonresidential intensity;
5. Identify the general location, amount, and type (whether designated for active or passive recreation) of
open space;
6. Identify the location of environmentally sensitive lands, wildlife habitat, and stream corridors;
7. Identify the on-site transportation circulation system, including the general location of all public and
private streets, existing or projected transit corridors, pedestrian and bicycle pathways, and how they
will connect with existing and planned City systems;
8. Identify the general location of on-site potable water and wastewater facilities, and how they will
connect to City systems;
9. Identify the general location of on-site stormwater management facilities, and how they will connect to
City systems; and
10. Identify the general location of all other on-site public facilities serving the development, including but
not limited to schools, and facilities for _ire protection, police protection, EMS, and solid waste
management.

applicable functional plans and small area plans adopted by the City.
c. Compatibility with Surrounding Areas
Development along the perimeter of a PD district shall be compatible with adjacent existing or proposed
development. Where there are issues of compatibility, the Master Plan shall provide for transition areas at
the edges of the PD district that provide for appropriate buffering and/or ensure a complementary
character of uses. Determination of complementary character shall be based on densities/intensities, lot
size and dimensions, building height, building mass and scale, hours of operation, exterior lighting, siting
of service areas, or other aspects identi_ied by the City Council.
d. Development Phasing Plan
If development in the PD district is proposed to be phased, the Master Plan shall include a development
phasing plan that identi_ies the general sequence or phases in which the district is proposed to be
developed, including how residential and nonresidential development will be timed, how infrastructure
(public and private) and open space will be provided and timed, and how development will be
coordinated with the City's capital improvements program.
e. Conversion Schedule
The Master Plan may include a conversion schedule that identi_ies the extent to which one type of
residential use may be converted to another type of residential use or one type of nonresidential use may
be converted to another type of nonresidential use (i.e., residential to residential, or nonresidential to
nonresidential). These conversions may occur within development areas and between development
areas, as long as they occur within the same development phase, as identi_ied by the approved
development phasing plan, and are consistent with established extents of conversion set down in the
conversion schedule.

PD-TN
PLANNED DEVELOPMENT -
TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD
DISTRICT
PURPOSE
The Planned Development - Tradi_onal Neighborhood (PD-TN) District is established and intended to
provide landowner/ developers with a flexible framework within which to develop a mixed-use,
tradi_onal neighborhood development as an alterna_ve to conven_onal residen_al development. PDTN
Districts should be of sufficient size and design to ensure pedestrian ac_vity focused on a
neighborhood center and sub-centers. PD-TN district standards are designed to encourage the
development of compact residen_ally-oriented, mixed-use, small-lot, pedestrian-oriented communi_es
where residents can meet some of their employment, shopping, and recrea_on needs within the same
development.

a. Additional District-Speci_ic Standards for the PD-TN District
1. Center and Subcenters
A PD-TN District shall be designed with a neighborhood center, and may also be served by one or more
sub-centers. A neighborhood center or sub-center shall consist of formal open space (such as a square,
commons, green, or active recreation area) that is adjacent to nonresidential or civic uses (such as a
school, religious institution, or other government building), and served by one or more prominent
street intersections.
2. Walking Distance
At least 80 percent of all residential dwelling units in a
PD-TN should be within a _ive minute walk
(approximately 1,250 feet) of the neighborhood center or
a sub-center (see Figure 30-3.G.5).
3. Use Mixing
a. A PD-TN District shall be structured to provide a mix
of uses, like residential, retail, employment, civic, and
recreational uses. The integration of residential and
nonresidential uses allows residents to meet more of
their daily needs within the development. In addition,
provision of a variety of housing options is required to
allow greater diversity of residents within the
neighborhood.
b. Civic uses are encouraged, but not required, as part of
the district's nonresidential uses.
c. Mixing of residential and nonresidential uses within a
single project or structure is encouraged within integrated or vertical mixed-use projects, in which
uses are located on different _loors of a single structure.
4. Open Space Design
a. Open space in a PD-TN District should be designed in a hierarchy of formal and informal spaces and
used to enhance community activity, identity, and civic pride. Formal open spaces consist of squares,
greens, common areas, or other park-like settings where residents of the neighborhood may gather.
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 628/938
Such areas are bounded by streets and/or buildings, and are typically located in or near the
geographic center of the neighborhood. Informal open spaces are typically located throughout the
development, and take the form of meandering walking paths, greenways, pocket parks, passive
recreation areas, and areas set aside for vegetation retention.
b. Some portion of the open space provided within a PD-TN shall be located to serve as a central open
space or gathering area for the development.
5. Building Con_iguration
a. Public Buildings and Uses
Public buildings and uses, including Government Facilities, Community Service uses, and
Educational Facilities, serve as focal points and landmarks for the community within a PD-TN
district and should be located on prominent sites, such as terminal vistas at the end of streets and
on prominent street corners. The Master Plan shall designate the general location of publicly or
privately owned civic lots for civic buildings and uses, including public monuments or gateways into
an ensuing space, as the terminus of street vistas for all major internal streets. In addition, public
buildings and uses shall be located fronting on or adjacent to a square, plaza, or village green
whenever possible.
b. Location and Relationship between Buildings
In a PD-TN district, buildings should be used to de_ine the street edge and the distinction between
the public domain of the street and the private space of individual lots. To this end, buildings should
have a fairly consistent, narrow setback alignment along the street frontage.
c. Relationship betweenBuilding Types
Buildings in a PD-TN district should be built on a human scale and designed with a common,
harmonious architectural vocabulary and landscaping to lend an intimate and personal feel to the
streetscape. The intent should not be to create a uniform appearance, but rather a distinct sense of
place.

30-3.H. Overlay Zoning Districts
30-3.H.1. General
a. Purpose
Overlay zoning districts are superimposed over portions of one or more underlying base zoning districts,
conditional zoning districts, or planned development districts with the intent of supplementing generally
applicable development regulations with additional development regulations that address special areaspeci
_ic conditions, features, or plans while maintaining the character and purposes of the underlying
zoning district.
b. Establishment of Overlay Zoning Districts

Regulations governing development in an overlay zoning district shall apply in addition to the
regulations governing development in the underlying base zoning district, conditional zoning district,
or planned development district. If the standards governing an overlay zoning district expressly
con_lict with those governing a base zoning district, conditional zoning district, or planned
development district, the standards governing the overlay district shall control. Where land is
classi_ied into multiple overlay zoning districts and the standards governing one overlay zoning district
expressly con_lict with those governing another overlay district, the more restrictive standard shall
apply.
2. Structures undergoing design review
Structures subject to design review pursuant to this Article by any of_icial design review board
established in this Article which are found to comply with the applicable design guidelines by the
applicable design review board shall be exempt from the dimensional standards of the underlying

b. Applicability
Irrespective of what standards the underlying zoning district applies, land within the Noise-Accident
Potential Overlay (NPO) district shall be subject to the standards of this subsection.
c. District Standards
1. Because of accident hazard potential, residential use in this zone should not be allowed without strong
demonstration of need to utilize this area for residential use. If allowed, it should be limited to the
minimum necessary area, and not exceed one dwelling unit per _ive acres. Additional consideration
should be given to modify the NLR levels based on peak noise levels. Such criteria, however, will not
eliminate outdoor environmental noise levels.
2. Clubhouses and other structures for gatherings should not be allowed. Passive recreation uses that do
not congregate people are allowed.
3. The indicated noise reduction level (20, 25, 30 or 35) applies to those portions of structures where the
public is received.
4. Uses are compatible if they do not result in a gathering of individuals in an area that would result in an
average density of greater than 25 persons per acre per hour during a 24-hour period, not to exceed 50
persons per acre at any time.
30-3.H.6. Airport Overlay (APO) District

hereby adopted and incorporated into these provisions.
c. District Standards
The land uses allowed under the terms of this Ordinance shall continue to be allowed in the same manner
as established by this Ordinance; however, upon the consideration of any petition for the rezoning of
property within the APO, the City Manager, the Zoning Commission, and the City Council shall give
considerable weight to the following factors when formulating their recommendations or decisions:
1. Uses
All allowed uses within the district being requested should be compatible with the continued
operation of the airport and consistent with the 2023 Off-Airport Land Use Plan, or subsequent
amendments to the plan.
2. Incompatible Uses in Other Districts
Any district that allows a use incompatible with the airport operations should not be favorably
considered without a favorable recommendation from the Fayetteville Airport Director to include such
uses as high concentration of residential units, buildings having large assembly of people, smoke or
other substances that would impair aircraft visibility or interfere with its operation, light emissions

Structures shall not be erected, altered, or maintained and no tree shall be allowed to grow to a height
in excess of the applicable height limits established and regulated by the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA), and prior to application for any Building Permit the developer shall provide the
City a copy of the FAA's acknowledgement of receipt of FAA Form 7460-1, Notice of Proposed
Construction or Alteration, as required by Part 77 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 C.F.R. Part
77). In the event, the FAA's acknowledgement indicates the proposed development would provide an
obstruction and/or a hazard to air navigation, the developer must provide either written consent from
the Airport Director as related to the proposed development or seek a Variance under the provisions of
this Ordinance. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, height limitations shall not apply to any
structure or any vegetation that is 35 feet or less in height, except when such tree or structure, because
of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limits of the FAA. The
FAA height limitations generally include the following:
a. Approach Zone
Height limitations for approach zones shall be determined by measuring outward and upward at a
50:1 slope for Runway 4/22 and slope of 50:1 for Runway 10/28. This measurement is commenced
from the end of and at the same elevation as the end of the respective runway centerline to the
prescribed horizontal distance.
b. Transitional Zone
Height limitations for the transitional zone shall be determined by measuring outward and upward
at a 7:1 slope from the sides of and at the same elevation as the Approach Surface, and extending to
the point of intersection with a horizontal surface or conical surface.
c. Conical Zone
Height limitations in the conical zone are established by measuring from the periphery of the
horizontal zone and at 150 feet above elevation outward and upward at a 20:1 slope to a height of
350 feet above airport elevation.
d. Horizontal Zone
Height limitations in the horizontal zone are established at 150 feet above airport elevation (190
MSL).
4. Notice Required
Any Site Plan, Subdivision Plan or Final Plat for land located within the APO that is submitted for
review and approval under the terms of this Ordinance shall contain the following notice: "Property
shown on this plan/plat is within the City of Fayetteville Airport Overlay District"
5. Lighting
Any allowed use, subdivision, or other development located within the APO shall not include outdoor
lighting or illumination arranged and/or operated in such a manner as to be misleading or pose a
danger to aircraft operations and in no case shall lighting be in contradiction to the provisions of this
Ordinance.
6. Penetrating Structures or Vegetation
The owner of any existing structure or vegetation that is currently penetrating any referenced surface
within the APO shall permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of whatever markers
and lights deemed necessary by the Federal Aviation Administration or by the Fayetteville Airport
Director to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of an airport
obstruction. These markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of
the Fayetteville Regional Airport.
7. Nonconforming Structures or Vegetation
a. The regulations prescribed in this section shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering,
or other change or alteration of any existing structure that is found to be nonconforming to the
provisions of this section as of the effective date of this Ordinance, or otherwise interfere with the
continuance of an existing use.

speci_ic development standards;
3. Promote responsible development that will result in minimal stormwater runoff, soil erosion, river
bank destabilization, and _lood damage;
4. Promote the preservation of a vegetative buffer corridor between the top of the river bank and new
development to protect property from _looding and to enhance water quality, while promoting
aesthetics;
5. Promote the protection of existing natural areas, wetlands, and habitats, especially bluffs along the
river;
6. Encourage the conservation, protection, and promotion of the overlay’s natural, cultural, and historic
resources to enhance its value as a signi_icant amenity to Fayetteville’s citizens, neighbors and
tourists;
7. Encourage the creation of identi_iable neighborhoods within the overlay and the enhancement of areas
of historical signi_icance;
8. Promote improvements to existing infrastructure;
9. Promote the river as a gateway to the city by encouraging the improvement of physical connections to
Downtown, Campbellton Landing, and the Cape Fear Botanical Gardens; and
10. Promote recreational access to the Cape Fear River.

of the proposed interconnecting drive areas along with all driveways to the street right-of-way.
Additionally, preservation of healthy existing trees is encouraged. Protection of specimen trees, or
mitigation to allow their removal, is required. Healthy, well-formed existing trees may be used to meet
certain landscaping requirements.
h. Nonconformities
To ensure the primary objective of the district is attained, strict implementation of the below provisions
regulating nonconformities within the district, with the exception of legal single family detached
residences conforming prior to the adoption of this amendment, is paramount. For purposes of this
section, permissible repair is de_ined as those repairs, not replacement, that are limited to routine or
ordinary maintenance and which would not result in the extension of the normal life of the structure.
Impermissible replacement is de_ined as maintenance, construction or re-construction of a
nonconforming structure or part thereof or structure housing a nonconforming use within the district
that is damaged by _ire, storm or other causes including natural deterioration to an extent exceeding 40
percent of the structure’s reproducible value or its bulk (including foundations)
1. All nonconforming uses not carried on within a structure, except those which are speci_ically allowed
as an accessory, ancillary or incidental to an allowed use subject to the provisions of this section, shall
be discontinued within one calendar year from the effective date of this ordinance, regardless whether
or not the nonconforming use status applies to structure(s) and premises in combination with the
nonconforming outdoor use – any subsequent use of the land and structures placed thereon shall
conform to the provisions of this section.
2. A nonconforming use may not be changed or expanded, or resumed if the nonconforming use has
ceased for a period of 180 calendar days within the district.
3. Any structure that is nonconforming due to noncompliance with dimensional requirements, but which
houses an allowed use within the district may continue provided that its nonconformity is not
increased, except where speci_ically approved by the Zoning Commission, and provided that prior to
any upgrades to any nonconforming structure housing an allowed use beyond permissible repairs, the
minimum landscaping and pedestrian improvements are implemented on the site.
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 647/938
4. Owners of properties within the district shall not allow for the impermissible replacement of any
nonconforming structure located inside the district unless speci_ically approved by the City Council.
5. Existing, legal nonconforming uses may be expanded through the Special Use Permit process in
accordance with Article 30-2.C.7 Special Use Permit.
(Ord. No. S2014-011, § 1, 8-11-2014; Ord. No. S2015-018, § 8, 12-14-2015; Ord. No. S2019-040, 1,
08/26/2019)
30-3.H.12. Regional Ac_vity Center Overlay District.
a. General description. The Regional Activity Center Overlay District is created to promote the continued
vitality of areas of the City that demonstrate a common, economically signi_icant contribution to the
community by ensuring continued compatibility between existing and future uses in terms of type, scale,
and character and by promoting compatibility with other uses proximate to the designated Regional
Activity Center.
b. Types of Regional Activity Centers. Each Regional Activity Center is uniquely de_ined based upon its
speci_ic economic contribution to the community. For example, Regional Activity Center that is de_ined by
a concentration of retail and restaurant uses would be designated in such a manner to support those uses
as the dominant categories of land use within the activity center. Likewise, a Regional Activity Center
based around a large medical use would include a land use focus supportive of the medical use.
c. Application. Prior to designating an area as a Regional Activity Center Overlay District, an analysis shall
be prepared to identify the de_ining land uses that make up the district, to identify land uses which are
compatible with or incompatible with the de_ining land uses, and to identify development characteristics,
including scale of development and site design features, that complement or threaten the de_ining land
uses. In establishing a Regional Activity Center Overlay District, City Council may establish limitations on
permitted uses and special uses allowed in the underlying zoning district or districts within the Regional
Activity Center. City Council may also establish standards with regard to development characteristics that
support the de_ining uses of the Regional Activity Center, such as setbacks, location and amount of
parking, access to and buffering of land uses proximate to the Regional Activity Center Overlay District,
and similar standards intended to ensure that the Regional Activity Center is maintained as a discrete
contributor to the city’s economic mission. Such use limitations and development standards shall be
clearly set forth in the ordinance adopting the Regional Activity Center Overlay District.
d. Designation of Speci_ic Overlays. Each speci_ic Regional Activity Center Overlay shall be entered as a
numbered subset of this enabling section and the overlay designated on the Of_icial Zoning Map as RACO-
[#].
(Ord. No. S2014-018, § 1, 10-27-2014)
30-3.H.13. Suburban Ac_vity Center Overlay (SACO) District
a. Purpose
The purpose of this Suburban Activity Center Overlay (SACO) District is to facilitate in_ill development
and redevelopment in key areas along arterial road corridors. The resulting concentrated mixture of uses
in a walkable development pattern is intended to achieve a critical mass of predominantly mixed-use
development to:
1. create centers of activity;
2. enhance the viability of existing businesses;
3. promote reinvestment and redevelopment;
4. implement adopted plans;
5. serve as a catalyst for future compatible development and redevelopment in the vicinity of the node;
6. ensure reasonable access from _lanking development to retail and neighborhood services; and
7. increase the ef_iciency and utilization of transportation facilities and services.
b. Applicability
A district may be established along any arterial road corridor, provided it is no larger than 125 acres in
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 648/938
area (equivalent to a ¼ mile radius around the center of the node) and no closer than approximately two
miles from another SACO District, unless otherwise speci_ied in an adopted corridor plan.
Within the SACO District, all development standards of Section 30-5 apply, unless speci_ically exempted
herein or addressed by a different standard (for example, sidewalk width).
Establishment of the overlay district may be initiated by the City or by owners of property in the speci_ied
area, in accordance with Sec. 30-2.C.1 Map Amendments. The standards would apply to development that
involves the construction of new buildings or the expansion of an existing building equal to or greater
than _ifty percent of the gross _loor area of the original structure.
c. Allowable Uses
The following uses shall be allowed as permitted or special uses (S) within the SACO district. Some uses
may be subject to additional requirements as noted below; such requirements may be modi_ied by a
positive recommendation from the TRC and approval by the City Manager for good cause, usually in the
context of a larger development. Ground _loor uses shall not include residential, health care facility, or
industrial uses except in outparcels.

Ar_cle 30-4: Use Standards
30-4.A. Use Table
30-4.A.1. Explana_on of Use Table Structure
a. General
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 653/938
1. Table 30-4.A, Use Table, lists land uses and indicates whether they are allowed by right, allowed as a
special use, allowed in a planned development zoning district, or prohibited in each base zoning
district and planned development district. The use table also includes references to any additional
requirements or regulations applicable to the speci_ic use type.
2. The status of a use in a conditional zoning district shall be the same as in the parallel base zoning
district unless such status is modi_ied by conditions imposed as part of the Conditional Rezoning
designating the conditional zoning district.
b. Organization of Uses
The use table organizes allowable uses by use classi_ications, use categories, and use types. The use table
and Section 30-4.B, Use Classi_ications, Categories, and Use Types, together provide a systematic basis for
identifying and consolidating or distinguishing unidenti_ied land uses to determine whether a particular
land use is allowable in a particular zoning district and in addressing future land uses.
1. Use Classi_ications
The use classi_ications identify broad general classi_ications of land use and include residential uses,
institutional uses, agricultural uses, commercial uses, and industrial uses. Use classi_ications are
further broken down into a series of general "use categories" and speci_ic "use types."
2. Use Categories
The use categories describe the major sub-groups of the respective use classi_ications and are based on
common functional, product, or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount of activity, the
type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, and site conditions. For
example, the Residential Use Classi_ication is divided into the Household Living and Group Living use
categories. Use categories are further broken down into a series of individual use types.
3. Use Types
The speci_ic use types are included in the respective use category. They identify the speci_ic principal
uses that are considered to fall within characteristics identi_ied in the use category. For example,
live/work dwellings, single-family detached dwellings, duplex dwellings, attached residential, multifamily
dwellings, and manufactured homes are use types in the Household Living Use Category.
c. Permitted Uses
A "P" in a cell of the use table indicates that the corresponding use category or use type is allowed by right
in the corresponding base zoning district or parallel conditional zoning district, subject to compliance
with the use-speci_ic standards referenced in the _inal column of the use table (and conditions imposed as
part of a Conditional Rezoning, if applicable). An "MP" is used in the columns for the planned
development districts, and speci_ies the allowable use types in a particular planned development district
provided the use type is set out in an approved master plan. Permitted uses are subject to all other
applicable regulations of this Ordinance, including those set forth in Article 5: Development Standards,
and Article 6: Subdivisions.
d. Special Uses
An "S" in a cell of the use table indicates that the corresponding use category or use type is allowed in the
corresponding base zoning district or parallel conditional zoning district, only upon approval of a Special
Use Permit in accordance with Section 30-2.C.7, Special Use Permit, any use-speci_ic standards referenced
in the _inal column of the use table, and any conditions imposed as part of a Conditional Rezoning (if
applicable). Uses subject to a Special Use Permit are subject to all other applicable regulations of this
Ordinance, including those set forth in Article 30-5: Development Standards, and Article 30-6:
Subdivisions.
e. Allowed Uses Subject to a Planned Development District Classi_ication
An "MP" in a cell indicates that a use category or use type is allowed by right in a planned development
district, subject to compliance with the use-speci_ic regulations set forth in the _inal column of the table
and provided the use is set out as a possible use type in an approved planned development master plan.
Allowed uses are subject to other applicable regulations in this Ordinance, including those set forth in
Section 30-3.G, Planned Development Zoning Districts. Use types that are blank are not allowable in a
particular planned development district, and shall not be included in a master plan.
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 654/938
f. Prohibited Uses
A cell with a slash "/" sign or that is blank in the use table indicates that the use type is prohibited in the
corresponding zoning district.
g. Use-Speci_ic Standards
When a particular use category or use type is permitted in a zoning district, there may be additional
regulations that are applicable to a speci_ic use. The existence of these use-speci_ic standards is noted
through a section reference in the last column of the use table titled "Additional Requirements."
References refer to Section 30-4.C, Use-Speci_ic Standards. These standards shall apply to a particular use
regardless of the base zoning district where it is proposed unless otherwise speci_ied.
h. Use Restricted or Prohibited by Overlay Zoning District
Regardless of whether the use table identi_ies a particular use type as a permitted use, allowed use, or
special use in a zoning district, or references additional requirements for the use type, the use type may
be restricted or prohibited, or subject to more restrictive additional requirements, in accordance with
applicable overlay district provisions in Section 30-3.H, Overlay Zoning Districts.
i. Unlisted Uses
The City Manager shall determine whether or not an unlisted use is part of an existing use category or use
type de_ined in Section 30-4.B, Use Classi_ications, Categories, and Types, or is substantially similar to an
already de_ined use type, using the standards in Section 30-4.B.1.d, Interpretation of Unlisted Uses. Uses
that are not part of or substantially similar to an existing use type are prohibited.
j. Review of Uses near Fort Bragg/Pope Air_ield
Within _ive miles of Fort Bragg and Pope Air_ield any use over 200 feet in height proposed to be
constructed or reconstructed, altered or expanded in ways that would aggravate or intensify a violation of
requirements of G.S. 143.151.70 to 77 must _irst be endorsed by the State Building Code Council,
following review and endorsement procedures speci_ied in the referenced General Statutes sections.

30-4.B. Use Classifica_ons, Use Categories, and Use Types
30-4.B.1. General
a. Purpose
This section is intended to provide a systematic framework for identifying, describing, categorizing, and
consolidating or distinguishing land uses in a way that makes it easier to determine how a particular land
use activity, or combination of activities, is to be considered in applying the use table and other provisions
in this Ordinance. This section is also intended to provide support in identifying instances where a new or
unanticipated land use not identi_ied in the use table is of such a nature, function, or duration that the
impact of allowing it in a particular zoning district is so similar to that of a use type already identi_ied in
the use table as allowed in the zoning district that allowing the new or unanticipated land use should be
interpreted as being consistent with the intent of the zoning district and the use regulations.
b. Structure of this Section
1. General
This section identi_ies each of the _ive use classi_ications in Table 30-4.A, Use Table, and includes a
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 668/938
section under each use classi_ication identifying each use category. There are "characteristics" and
"examples" subsections under each use category (individual use types are de_ined in Article 30-9:
De_initions).
2. Principal Use Characteristics and Accessory Uses
The "characteristics" subsection describes common characteristics of each use category. Principal uses
are assigned to the use category that most closely describes the nature of the principal use. Also listed
are examples of common accessory uses that, unless otherwise stated in this Ordinance, are allowed in
conjunction with a principal use.
3. Examples
The "examples" subsection lists common examples of use types included in the respective use category.
The names of these sample uses are generic. They are based on common meanings and not on what a
speci_ic use may call itself. For example, a use that calls itself "wholesale sales," but sells mostly to
consumers, is included in the Retail Sales and Service Use Category rather than the Wholesale Sales
Use Category. This is because the activity on the site matches the characteristics of the Retail Sales and
Service Use Category.
c. Developments with Multiple Principal Uses
When all principal uses of a development fall within one use category, the entire development is assigned
to that use category. A development that contains a coffee shop, bookstore, and bakery, for example,
would be classi_ied in the Retail Sales and Service Use Category because all of the development's principal
uses are in that use category. When the principal uses of a development fall within different use
categories, each principal use is classi_ied in the applicable use category and each use is subject to
applicable regulations for that use category. Developments with multiple principal uses, such as shopping
centers, shall incorporate only those use types allowed in the applicable zoning district.
d. Interpretation of Unlisted Uses
1. Procedure for Interpreting Unlisted Uses as Permitted
a. Unless interpreted as a permitted use in accordance with (b) below, unlisted uses are prohibited.
b. The City Manager may interpret a particular land use not expressly listed in the use table as allowed
in a particular zoning district, in accordance with the procedure in Section 30-2.C.17, Interpretation,
and based on the standards in Section 30-4.B.1.d.2, Standards for Approving Unlisted Uses as
Permitted.
2. Standards for Interpreting Unlisted Uses as Permitted
The City Manager shall interpret an unlisted land use as permitted in a particular zoning district only
after determining that the nature, function, and duration of the use and the impact of allowing it in the
zoning district are so similar to those of a use type or use category allowable in the zoning district that
the unlisted land use should be deemed allowable in the same manner as the similar use type or use
category. In making such determination, the City Manager shall consider the purpose and intent
statements in this Ordinance concerning the zoning district, the character of use types allowable in the
district, and all relevant characteristics of the unlisted use, including but not limited to the following:
a. The volume and type of sales, retail, wholesale, etc.;
b. The size and type of items sold and nature of inventory on the premises;
c. Any processing done on the premises, including assembly, manufacturing, warehousing, shipping,
distribution;
d. Any dangerous, hazardous, toxic, or explosive materials used in the processing;
e. The nature and location of storage and outdoor display of merchandise, whether enclosed, open,
inside or outside the principal building; predominant types of items stored (such as business
vehicles, work-in-process, inventory, and merchandise, construction materials, scrap and junk, and
raw materials including liquids and powders);
f. The type, size, and nature of buildings and structures;
g. The number and density of employees and customers per unit area of site in relation to business
hours and employment shifts;
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 669/938
h. Transportation requirements, including the modal split for people and freight, by volume type and
characteristic of traf_ic generation to and from the site;
i. Trip purposes and whether trip purposes can be shared by other use types on the site;
j. Parking requirements, turnover and generation, ratio of the number of spaces required per unit
area or activity;
k. The amount and nature of any nuisances generated on the premises, including but not limited to
noise, smoke, odor, glare, vibration, radiation, and fumes;
l. Any special public utility requirements for serving the proposed use type, including but not limited
to water supply, wastewater output, pre-treatment of wastes and emissions required or
recommended, and any signi_icant power structures and communications towers or facilities; and
m. The impact on adjacent lands created by the proposed use type, which should not be greater than
that of other use types allowed in the zoning district.
3. Effect of Approval of Unlisted Use
a. After interpreting an unlisted land use as permitted in a particular zoning district, the City Manager
shall determine whether the unlisted use is likely to be common or to recur frequently, or whether
its omission from the use table is likely to lead to public uncertainty and confusion. On determining
that the unlisted use is likely to be common or would lead to confusion if unlisted, the City Manager
shall initiate an application for a Text Amendment to list the use in the use table. Until _inal action is
taken on the Text Amendment application, the City Manager's interpretation shall be binding.
b. If after interpreting an unlisted land use as permitted in a particular zoning district, the City
Manager determines that the unlisted use is of an unusual or transitory nature, and unlikely to recur
frequently, the interpretation shall be binding in accordance with Section 30-2.C.17.f, Effect of
Interpretation, without further action or amendment of this Ordinance.
c. Appeals of the City Manager's decision shall be submitted in accordance with the standards in
Section 30-2.C.18, Appeal.
e. Adaptive Reuse
1. General description. Adaptive reuse is intended to promote in_ill development, community
compatibility, and economic development by allowing and providing incentives for adaptively reusing
valuable existing buildings after public review through the Neighborhood Compatibility Permit
process. Fayetteville has a stock of _ine older buildings that greatly contribute to the City's quality of
life and urban character. Due to design, location and/or condition, these buildings may become
physically or functionally obsolete for use under their current zoning. Adaptive reuse permits a wider
range of land uses to be available to these existing buildings for he purpose of extending their useful
life.

the Neighborhood Compatibility Permit process:
1. Multi-family residential uses, not subject to the density limitations of the underlying zoning
district(s).
2. Community Services; community center, library, senior center, cultural facilities.
3. Education (all)
4. Institutional (assisted living, nursing home, religious institution - large)
b. In multi-family residential districts, the following are permitted uses as noted below and subject to

online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 670/938
3. Development and design standards.
a. Application. The provisions of adaptive reuse shall be limited to the reuse of existing principal and
accessory structures and shall not apply to new construction of principal or accessory structures
except as provided herein. Adaptive reuse structures shall have unique characteristics that promote
neighborhood or community character, are essential for economic development, or otherwise
contribute to the surrounding area such that their preservation is justi_ied under the provisions of
this section.

with vegetation from adjacent single-family uses. The vegetative screening shall consist of the
planting required for a Type A buffer unless a more extensive buffer is required by the Planning
Commission. On-street parking or parking in the front or side of the lot may be approved by
the Planning Commission provided that any off-street parking area can be adequately screened from
adjacent residential uses and:
The topography of the site or the placement of the principal structure makes it impractical to
access the rear of the property; or
The majority of the residentially-zoned properties on both sides of the street on the block on
which the proposed use is to be constructed have a similar amount or area of parking located in
the front or side.
e. Maintenance of architectural character. The architectural character of principal and accessory
structures, including fenestration (i.e., door and window openings), shall be maintained with regard
to any facade that faces a street or is prominently visible from adjoining properties.
f. Expansion. The gross _loor area of principal and accessory structures may be increased by up to 25
percent provided that such expansion maintains the architectural character of the structure(s)
pursuant to (v.) above.
g. Compliance with building and life safety codes. The structure(s) shall comply with all applicable
building and life safety codes.
h. Buffer and landscaping requirements. The Planning Commission may reduce or waive buffer and
landscaping requirements to maintain consistency in appearance with the surrounding
neighborhood.
i. Compatibility. The Planning Commission may establish conditions regarding lighting. landscaping,
hours of operation, signage, and other operational and site design features necessary to maintain
compatibility with surrounding properties.

in which they are located or the review procedure by which they are approved. This section is intended to
identify the use-speci_ic standards for all principal uses identi_ied in Table 30-4.A, Use Table, as subject to
"additional requirements." These standards may be modi_ied by other applicable requirements in this
Ordinance.
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 682/938
These standards are not subject to a variance request. However, with the following exceptions or as explicitly
stated in other sections of this ordinance, the separation standards may be reduced upon approval of a
special use permit _inding that the reduction in the separation standard does not increase negative impacts
on surrounding uses. and that there are speci_ic characteristics that help minimize any negative impacts,
such as natural or man-made features that create visual or physical separation between the uses. Consistent
with standards for the procedure in Article 30-2.C.7 Administration – Special Use Permit, conditions may be
attached to further minimize or prevent negative impacts, including limitations on hours of operation,
maximum size, or range of activities. Uses which cannot use the special use process to seek reduction in
separation standards are:
1. Adult entertainment
2. Bar, nightclub, cocktail lounge except that a bar, nightclub, cocktail lounge in the DT Downtown district or
MU Mixed Use District can request a reduced separation standard from any child care center, religious
institution, or educational facility through the special use process. A brewpub is exempted from the
separation requirements although issues of concentration of such uses may be considered during any
associated special use or conditional zoning review.
In the event that a special use permit or administrative adjustment is issued to reduce separation
requirements between certain uses, any use legally existing at the time the special use permit or adjustment
is issued shall not be precluded from expanding on property that is currently being used for the use that
requires the separation. For example, if a special use permit is issued to allow a religious institution to be
established within 500 linear feet of a bar, the bar use is not prohibited from expanding on property being
used for the bar use at the time the separation reduction special use permit is issued, nor in the event the bar
use is damaged or destroyed beyond 50% of its appraised value shall the adjusted separation be a factor in
whether the use may be rebuilt.

master plan. If there is a reference contained in the column entitled "Additional Requirements," refer to
the cited section(s) for additional standards that apply to the speci_ic accessory use.
3. Interpretation of Unidenti_ied Accessory Uses
The City Manager shall evaluate potential accessory uses that are not identi_ied in Table 30-4.D, Table
of Permitted Accessory Uses, on a case-by-case basis, as an Interpretation (Section 30-2.C.17). In
making the interpretation, the City Manager shall apply the following standards.

30-5.A.3. General Standards for Off-Street Parking, Stacking, and Loading Areas
a. Use of Parking Area, Stacking Area, or Loading Space
All vehicular parking areas, stacking areas, methods of vehicular ingress and egress, internal aisles, and
loading spaces required by this section may be referred to as "vehicular use area" and shall be used only
for their intended purposes. Any other use, including, but not limited to, vehicular storage, vehicle sales,
vehicular repair work, vehicle service, or display of any kind, shall constitute a separate business use of
the space.
b. Identi_ied as to Purpose and Location
Off-street parking areas of three or more spaces and off-street loading spaces shall include painted lines,
wheel stops, or other methods of identifying individual parking and loading spaces and loading areas and
distinguishing such spaces from aisles or other vehicular use areas.
c. Surfacing
Except as provided for in Section 30-5.A.5, Parking Standards for Residential Development, and Section
30-5.A.8.i, Alternative Materials, all off-street parking, loading, and circulation areas shall be surfaced with
asphalt, concrete, brick, stone, pavers, aligned concrete strips, or an equivalent material. These materials
shall be maintained in a smooth, well-graded condition.
d. Arrangement
1. Convenient Access
a. All off-street parking, loading, and circulation areas shall be arranged for the access and safety of
pedestrians and vehicles.
b. Off-street parking areas with three or more spaces shall be arranged so that no parking or
maneuvering incidental to parking shall occur on a public street or sidewalk, and so that an
automobile may be parked and un-parked without moving another automobile (except as provided
in Section 30-5.A.8.g, Valet and Tandem Parking).
c. Large developments providing over 200 spaces are subject to one or both off-street circulation
standards found in Section 30-5.A.11.e, Primary Drive Aisles and 30-5.A.11.f, Pedestrian Pathways.
d. Large non-residential development with a single ground plate area of over 75,000 gross square feet

online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 729/938
2. Backing onto Streets Prohibited
Except for parking areas serving single-family detached dwellings, all off-street parking, loading, and
circulation areas shall be arranged so that no vehicle is required to back from such areas directly onto a
public street. Vehicular access ways and vehicular use areas on private lands are not considered public
streets.
3. Easements
No off-street parking, loading, or circulation area shall be located within an easement without the
written consent of the person or agency that holds the easement, unless already provided for by an
existing easement agreement.
e. Access and Curb Cuts
Any construction of or modi_ication to an access drive or curb cut shall require prior approval of the City
Manager. This provision shall not apply to private drives that are consistent with 30-5.F.4.a.7, which
requires that private streets be built to the same standard as public streets.
f. Parking Lot Cross-Access
1. General
All development except single-family attached or detached dwellings and two- to four-family dwellings
shall be designed to allow for cross-access to adjacent compatible development in accordance with the
following standards:
a. Limited to Two Parcels
Cross-access ways shall be designed and located based on the standards of this section, but in no case
shall a development be required to provide cross-access to more than two adjacent parcels.
b. Future Stubs Required
A connection for future parking lot cross-access shall be provided to all adjacent vacant land zoned
MR-5 or within a Business or Planned Development zoning district. Development subject to these
standards shall be designed to provide future cross-access in at least one location while remaining in
compliance with all landscaping and stormwater standards.
c. Minimum Width
Cross-access ways shall allow for two-way traf_ic between parcels through the use of a single drive
aisle with a minimum width of 20 feet, or through two one-way aisles, each with a minimum width
of ten feet.

based on consideration of topography or natural features, vehicular safety factors, adequate access
from comparable side streets, or similar factors.
b. When cross-access is waived in accordance with this section, bicycle and pedestrian connections
shall be provided between adjacent developments or uses, unless the provision is deemed
unreasonable or impracticable.
3. Recording Required
Where provided, a cross-access easement shall be recorded by the owner/developer prior to issuance
of a Certi_icate of Occupancy (see Section 30-2.C.13).
g. Drainage
All off-street parking, loading, and circulation areas shall be properly drained in accordance with the
stormwater management standards in Chapter 23 of the Code of Ordinances, so as not to cause any
nuisance on adjacent land.
h. Exterior Lighting
When lighted, off-street parking, loading, and circulation areas shall be lighted so as to prevent glare or
illumination exceeding maximum allowable levels on adjacent land (see Table 30-5.E.5, Maximum
Illumination Levels), and unless exempted, shall comply with the standards of Section 30-5.E, Exterior
Lighting.
i. Landscaping
All off-street parking lots, stacking lanes, loading, and other circulation areas shall be landscaped to soften
their visual impact on adjacent areas, and unless exempted, shall comply with the standards of Section 30-
5.B.4.c, Vehicular Use Area Landscaping.
j. Curbs and Motor Vehicle Stops
All off-street parking, loading, and circulation areas shall be designed to prevent vehicles from
overhanging a right-of-way, sidewalk, walkway, or adjacent property.
k. Maintained in Good Repair
1. Maintained at All Times
All off-street parking, loading, motor vehicle stops, and circulation areas shall be maintained in good
repair and in safe condition at all times so as not to constitute a hazard to public safety or a visual or
aesthetic nuisance to surrounding land.
2. Periodically Restored
All off-street parking, loading, motor vehicle stops, and circulation areas shall be periodically painted or
otherwise restored to maintain a clear identi_ication of separate parking stalls or loading spaces.
l. Responsibility for Provision
The responsibility for providing the off-street parking, loading, and circulation areas required by this
section shall be that of whoever develops the land requiring parking and loading areas. Review for
compliance with the standards of this section shall occur during review of an application for a Site Plan
(see Section 30-2.C.5), Building Permit (see Section [@@9372]), or Temporary Use Permit (see Section 30-
2.C.10), as appropriate.
m. Construction of Off-street Parking, Loading, and Circulation Areas
All off-street parking, loading, and circulation areas shall be completed prior to the issuance of a Certi_icate
of Occupancy (see Section 30-2.C.13) for the use or uses they serve. In the case of phased development,
surface off-street parking, loading, and circulation areas should only be provided for the portions of the
development for which a Site Plan (see Section 30-2.C.5) is approved.

street parking or loading standard. Upon receiving a development application for a use subject to this
subsection, the City Manager shall apply the off-street parking, loading, and circulation standard speci_ied
for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or establish minimum off-street parking
standards on the basis of a parking and loading study prepared by the applicant. Such a study shall include
estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of Traf_ic Engineers (ITE) or
other acceptable estimates as approved by the City Manager, and should include other reliable data
collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as or comparable with the proposed use.
Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location. The study
shall document the source of data used to develop the recommendations.
e. Mixed-Uses
Unless otherwise approved, lots containing more than one use shall provide parking spaces in an amount
equal to the total of the standards for all individual uses. This provision shall not limit the ability to submit
an Alternative Parking Plan (see Section 30-5.A.8) to reduce the minimum number of required off-street
parking spaces in recognition of different operating hours or peak business periods.

1. Minimum Dimensions
Each compact car parking space shall have minimum dimensions of eight feet in width and 16 feet in
length, with a total area of at least 128 square feet;
2. Location
Compact car parking spaces shall be located no closer to the primary building entrance than any
standard parking spaces; and
3. Designated
All compact car spaces shall be designated by signage and pavement marking.

shared parking. Justi_ication shall include information on the size and type of the proposed
development, the composition of tenants, the anticipated rate of parking turnover, and the
anticipated peak parking and traf_ic loads for all uses that will be sharing off-street parking spaces.
b. Recorded Agreement
A Shared Parking Plan portion of an Alternative Parking Plan shall be enforced through written
agreement among all owners of record. An attested copy of the agreement between the owners of
record must be recorded with the Cumberland County Register of Deeds. Recordation of the
agreement shall take place prior to issuance of a Certi_icate of Occupancy (see Section 30-2.C.13) for
any use to be served by the shared parking areas. A shared parking agreement may be revoked only
if all required off-street parking spaces will be provided in accordance with the requirements of
Table 30-5.A.4.b, Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards.
d. Off-Site Parking for Nonresidential Uses

spaces required in Table 30-5.A.4.b, Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards, if the request complies with
the following standards:
1. Fewer Spaces Needed
The applicant shall demonstrate that because of the location, nature, or mix of uses, there is a
reasonable probability the number of parking spaces actually needed to serve the development is less
than the minimum required by Table 30-5.A.4.b, Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards.
2. Reserve Parking Plan
The request shall be accompanied by a Reserve Parking Plan identifying: (a) the amount of off-street
parking being deferred, and (b) the location of the area to be reserved for future parking, if future
parking is needed.

provided in a parking structure shall be screened, insofar as practicable, from surrounding uses and from
public view as required by Section 30-5.B.4.c, Vehicular Use Area Landscaping. In addition, for uses located
on the same lot as the structure, the standards required for shared parking shall apply. For uses located on
a different lot as the structure, the standards required for off-site parking shall apply.
g. Valet and Tandem Parking
An off-street parking program utilizing limited tandem parking may be allowed for uses listed under the
commercial or industrial use classi_ication in Table 30-5.A.4.b, Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards, in

Enforcement.
(Ord. No. S2012-016, § 4.0, 9-10-2012)
30-5.B.3. General Requirements
a. PreApplication Meeting and Tree Protection Plan
It is important to identify any characteristics of a site that make it special. Added value to the resulting
design may be achieved by identifying and considering these attributes prior to the advancement of the
development plans.
Wooded sites provide distinct aesthetic, economic and environmental signi_icance and value as a natural
resource of the City. Existing vegetation plays a critical role in maintaining aesthetics, water quality,
minimizing erosion and downstream _looding, and increasing quality of life as well as reducing site
development cost to replant and restore a portion of what was unknowingly removed. Critical to the
satisfaction of this portion of the UDO is the identi_ication of existing trees as a resource feature.
1. Prior to plan development and submittal, the applicant shall meet with the City and provide the City
with a graphic depiction on an aerial map illustrating the existing tree canopy and potential areas for
preservation of existing healthy trees with good form. Knowing the location and size of signi_icant trees
on the development site facilitates a common understanding of what options and incentives are
available to preserve trees and improve the appearance of the proposed development while meeting the
development goals of the applicant.
2. The applicant shall also provide information on the location and species of any trees having a DBH of 30
inches or greater which may currently exist on the site. Potential opportunities for tree preservation
will be discussed. Tree preservation is to be determined in conjunction with the City's input.
3. Once determined, the applicant shall indicate the location of the tree protection zones on the
development plans. Tree protection areas based on the trees' critical root zones shall be noted and
drawn to scale on demolition, grading and erosion control, and landscaping plans. The general type, size
and nature of the existing trees to be saved and credited toward landscaping requirements shall be

Standards for New Plan_ngs
included as a table, as well as being graphically illustrated (see Section 30-5.B.6, Tree Preservation and
Section 30-5.B.8, Tree Preservation During Construction).
4. Tree save areas must be described by metes and bounds on the recorded plat, individual recorded
deeds, and all property association documents for land held in common.
b. Landscape Plan
1. To ensure compliance with the standards of this section, a landscape plan demonstrating how
landscaping will be planted on a development site shall be included as a part of any development
application.
2. In the event of phased development, a landscape plan shall be required for each distinct phase of the
development, and shall depict landscaping associated with the particular phase of development.
3. The landscape plan should be prepared by a professional, knowledgeable about plant material and
design. Please refer to the City's landscaping guidelines for additional guidance on what is to be
included on the landscape plan.
c. Coordination with Stormwater Requirements
When required stormwater management facilities are enhanced as a site amenity they may qualify as a
portion of the required open space. Determination of credit shall be at the discretion of the city manager in
accordance with the provisions of Section 30-5.C.3.b.6.
d. Coordination with Site Lighting
Coordination is required so that site lighting is located an appropriate distance from trees to minimize
future con_lict (see Section 30-5.E.5.d).
e. Planting Standards
1. Existing Vegetation
Existing healthy, well-formed canopy and/or understory trees as well as healthy shrubs may be
credited toward the requirements of this section, provided the vegetation meets or exceeds the
minimum size standards and is protected before and during development of the site and maintained
thereafter in a healthy growing condition (see Section 30-5.B.7, Tree Preservation Incentives).
a. The property owner must include in a tree survey (see Section 30-5.B.6.d, Tree Survey) all existing
trees four-inch caliper or greater proposed to be saved to satisfy a portion of the planting
requirements. A tree survey is otherwise not required.
b. Only healthy trees free of invasive species that have been protected during the entire development
period, beginning prior to the commencement of site work and continuing through to issuance of the
certi_icate of occupancy in accordance with approved tree protection requirements may satisfy
these planting requirements.
c. Preserved vegetation is to be maintained thereafter in a healthy growing condition free of invasive
plant species.
d. If the minimum protection standards are not met, or if trees are observed by the City to be injured or
threatened, the vegetation may be deemed ineligible for meeting these requirements.
e. Where existing vegetation is used in buffer yards, supplemental plantings may be required, if the
existing vegetation does not provide the same effect that a planted buffer would after _ive years of
normal growth.
2. New Plantings
The City shall maintain and make available, a list of recommended plant material hardy to the
Fayetteville area and a plant list maintained by PWC for materials suitable for planting under power
lines. Plant material not on the list may be approved by the City and the utility provider on a case-bycase
basis. In the absence of a list for the City, the list published by the North Carolina Cooperative
Extension Service shall serve as the list of recommended trees. Plantings shall comply with the
following standards (see Figure 30-5.B.3.e.2, Minimum Planting Standards for New Plantings, below):
a. Deciduous canopy trees shall be a minimum
of two inches in caliper at the time of
planting, as determined in the American

9. Maintenance of Landscaping Materials
The owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of all landscape areas not in the public right-ofway.
Such areas shall be maintained in accordance with the approved Landscape Plan or Alternative
Landscape Plan and shall present a healthy and orderly appearance free from refuse and debris. All
plant life shown on an approved Landscape Plan or Alternative Landscape Plan shall be replaced in
compliance with the minimum standards of this section, if it dies, is seriously damaged, or removed.
This section is not intended to prevent normal, routine maintenance.
a. Damage Due to Natural Occurrence
In the event that any vegetation or physical element functioning to meet the standards of this section
is severely damaged due to an unusual weather occurrence or natural catastrophe, or other natural
occurrence such as damage by wild or domestic animals, the owner or developer may be required to
replant if the landscaping standards are not being met. The owner shall have one growing season to
replace or replant. The City Manager shall consider the type and location of the landscape buffer or
required vegetation area as well as the propensity for natural revegetation in making a
determination on the extent of replanting requirements.
b. Protection During Operations
The owner or developer shall take actions to protect trees and landscaping from unnecessary
damage during all facility and site maintenance operations. Plants shall be maintained in a way that
does not obstruct sight distances at roadway and drive intersections, obstruct traf_ic signs or
devices, or interfere with the use of sidewalks or pedestrian trails.
c. Prohibition Against Severe Tree Pruning
All required trees (whether canopy or understory) shall be maintained in their characteristic natural
shape, and shall not be severely pruned, sheared, topped, or shaped as shrubs. Trees (including, but

online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 755/938
not limited to Crape Myrtles) that have been severely pruned, sheared, topped, shaped as shrubs,
such that they no longer serve the intended buffering or screening function, shall be considered as
damaged vegetation in need of replacement in accordance with Section 30-5.B.3.e.9.a, Damage Due
to Natural Occurrence, and shall be replaced within one growing season.
d. Removal of Invasive Species
Regular maintenance shall include regular removal of invasive plant species. For purposes of this
section, invasive plant species are considered removed if they are no longer living in the tree canopy.
Subsequent property owners are required to maintain this condition for compliance with the
chapter.
e. Natural Death
The natural death of existing vegetation within any required landscape area does not necessarily
constitute a violation and does not require re-vegetation to replace the plant material unless the
required landscape area no longer complies with the standards of this section. In no instance shall
this provision be construed to prevent re-planting if, in the opinion of the City Manager, the required
performance standard of the landscaping is not being met.
10. Monitoring of Compliance with Landscaping Standards
a. Inspections Prior to Certi_icate of Occupancy
The City Manager shall inspect the site prior to the issuance of a Certi_icate of Occupancy for the
development and such Certi_icate shall not be issued if the landscaping required under this section is

Figure 30-5.B.4.b: Site and Building Landscaping Placement
Site landscaping includes founda_on plan_ngs and trees dispersed across a development site.
c. Vehicular Use Area Landscaping
All vehicular use areas shall include landscaping, both within the interior of the vehicular use area and
around its perimeter (see Figure 30-5.B.4.c, Vehicular Use Area Landscaping), as a means of mitigating the
parking area's microclimate and visual impacts.
1. Purpose and Intent
It is the intent of this section to visually modify the appearance and break the blight created by large
expanses of vehicular use areas; _ilter and reduce the glare of re_lected sunlight from parked
automobiles onto adjacent properties and the public street right-of-way; separate the public from the ill
effects of fumes and dust; and provide shade, noise attenuation, and _iltering of the air of particulate
and gaseous pollutants.
2. Applicability
These standards shall apply to all development in the City with on-site vehicular use areas, except
single-family detached, and duplex, triplex or quadraplex dwellings on a single lot.
3. Interior Vehicular Use Area Landscaping Standards
All parking areas with 12 or more spaces shall provide and maintain landscaping areas within the
interior of the parking lot in accordance with the standards in this subsection. These standards shall
not apply to parking structures or automotive sales or display lots.

a. Landscaped planting areas shall be distributed throughout the parking area for the purpose of heat
abatement.
b. All rows of interior parking shall be terminated by a tree planted within a landscape island.
Perimeter parking detailed in subparagraph c. does not require a landscape tree.
c. One tree shall be required for every 12 parking spaces. All vehicular parking spaces must have at
least one canopy tree within 60 feet of each parking space, or one understory tree within 30 feet.
Trees planted within perimeter vehicular use landscaping strips may be used to satisfy this
requirement.
d. At least 50 percent of all trees required by this section shall be canopy trees.
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 759/938
e. Each planting area shall contain suf_icient area and back_ill soil to accommodate the root growth of
the plant material used as discussed in the General Requirements in Section 30-5.B.3.e.3.
f. When a pedestrian pathway median (see Section 30-5.A.11.f, Pedestrian Pathways) is widened to
accommodate trees and the minimum planting area referenced in Section 30-5.B.3.e.3 is observed,
the adjacent tree islands that would otherwise be required every 12 parking spaces (see Section 30-
5.B.4.c.3.c, above), may be eliminated in this area. Other requirements of this section still apply.
g. All planting areas shall be protected from vehicle damage by the installation of curbing, wheel stops,
or other comparable methods. The size of the planting area, size of plant material at maturity, and
placement of plant material shall allow for a two-and-one-half-foot bumper overhang from the face
of the curb when wheel stops are not used. This standard shall not prohibit the use of planting areas
as stormwater management devices.
h. For expansion or renovation projects where the application of these requirements is infeasible or
unworkable, the applicant may propose an alternative landscape plan as outlined in Section 30-
5.B.4.f, Alternative Landscape Plan.
(Ord. No. S2013-026, § 1, 11-18-2013)
4. Perimeter Vehicular Use Area Landscaping Strips
Vehicular use areas shall be separated and screened from all adjoining properties by a landscape strip.
a. Continuous Visual Screen in Non-Residential Areas
Commercial (non-residential) vehicular use areas shall be separated from adjoining commercial
properties with a minimum _ive foot wide landscape strip. When head-in parking adjacent to the
property line includes wheel stops, the minimum width of the landscape strip is reduced to three
feet. The landscape strip shall be planted with a continuous visual screen of evergreen shrubs along
the property line, with a minimum height of 24 inches at the time of planting. Required sight
clearances at driveways and near intersections shall not be subject to this requirement. When a
parking lot will be consolidated with an adjacent parcel, the landscaping strip may be eliminated
(see Section 30-5.B.4c.4.c, below).
b. Adjacent to Off-Street Surface Parking on Other Lots
Parking lots should be consolidated and circulation systematized when possible with more creative
and effective landscaping, pedestrian circulation, and lighting, rather than having a series of smallersized
parking lots divided by arbitrary lots lines with landscaped buffers. To this end, the vehicular
use area landscape strip may be eliminated when the proposed parking lot will be combined with an
existing or future adjoining parking lot. A recorded Cross Parking Agreement between the
cooperating parties is required to provide non-exclusive access (for vehicles and pedestrians) to
driveways, maneuvering areas, parking areas, and so on.
c. Credit Towards Property Perimeter Landscape Buffer Requirements
Perimeter landscape strips associated with a vehicular use area may be credited towards perimeter
buffer standards (see Section 30-5.B.4.d, below), provided the minimum applicable buffer standards
are met, and provided the vehicular use area perimeter landscaping is within the area to be occupied
by the property perimeter landscape buffer.
d. Parking Lot Entrance Aisles and Stacking Lanes
Driveways into parking areas shall include a landscape strip at least ten feet wide along each side of
the driveway. At a minimum, the driveway landscape strip shall include one canopy tree for every 25
to 40 linear feet of drive or one understory tree for every 15 to 25 linear feet of drive. A minimum of
one shrub shall be planted for every _ive linear feet of driveway entrance. Plant material may be
grouped as an entrance feature rather than planted as a linear border.
5. Street Yard Buffer
a. Purpose and Intent
The purpose of the street yard buffer is to enhance the streetscape and public environment by
abating glare and moderating temperatures of impervious areas; _iltering air of fumes and dust;
providing shade; attenuating noise; and reducing the visual impact of large expanses of pavement
through the provision of a visually modifying screen of plants. The intent is to provide at a minimum
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 760/938
an opaque buffer at the ground level up to three feet, with open views available through and
between taller plant material. Existing vegetation should be used to satisfy these planting
requirements where possible.
b. Applicability
A street yard buffer shall be required for all vehicular use areas that are established within 50 feet of
any street right-of-way (including controlled access highways) unless separated by an intervening
building. When buildings are moved up to the street, the street yard requirement is eliminated.
c. Minimum Requirements
The depth of the street yard varies, based upon the size of the adjacent parking lot as described
below:

d. Alternative Option for Constrained Sites - Garden Walls
Masonry garden walls may be constructed on constrained sites in lieu of the vegetated street yard
buffer (described above in Table 30-5.B.4.c.5.c) as determined by the city manager. DOT approval
may also be required. The garden wall option is particularly well-suited in the Downtown and
Hospital Overlay Districts as well for redevelopment sites. Such walls shall comply with the design
standards established below.

Masonry garden walls may be constructed on constrained sites in lieu of the vegetated street yard buffer described in Table 30-5.B.4.c.5.c.
d. Property Perimeter Landscape Buffers
1. Purpose and Intent
Perimeter landscape buffers are intended to mitigate potential negative effects of contiguous uses in
differing zoning districts by protecting and preserving the appearance, character and value of property
within the City. The objective is to exclude visual contact, create spatial separation and to minimize any
adverse impacts on adjacent properties. Where topographical changes, the size and shape of existing
lots of record, or other spatial considerations exist which would make adherence to the basic
requirement either impossible or ineffective in meeting the purpose of the buffer yard, alternate buffer
yard plans will be considered or may be required.
2. Applicability
All development shall provide a property perimeter landscape buffer at the edge of the development to
separate it from differently-zoned adjacent property in accordance with Table 30-5.B.4.d.4, Buffer
Types, and Table 30-5.B.4.d.5, Buffer Type Application.
3. Use of Existing Trees
Existing healthy, well-formed trees located at the property perimeter shall remain undisturbed (except
for the removal of dead wood and invasive vines) and may be credited toward the requirement of this
section, in accordance with Section 30-5.B.7.a, Tree Preservation Credits. Additional trees and shrubs
may be required to bring the natural buffer up to the full perimeter buffer requirements.
4. Types of Buffers
Table 30-5.B.4.D.4, Property Perimeter Buffer Types, describes different buffering options in terms of
their function, opacity, width, and planting requirements. Where a particular buffer type is required in
Table 30-5.B.4.D.5, Buffer Type Applications, the requirement may be met with the combination of
minimum buffer width and minimum screening requirements speci_ied under either Option 1 or
Option 2. Trees and shrubs within a 25-foot wide buffer shall be spread in a staggered, off-set pattern
to establish a full and opaque buffer. Where an option utilizing a berm or fence is selected, the berm or
fence shall comply with the standards of Section 30-5.B.3.e.6, Berms, or Section 30-5.D, Fences and
Walls, as appropriate. All exposed areas of soil within the buffer area must be covered with mulch,
groundcover vegetation, or grass.

[2] Development in PD districts is subject to perimeter buffer requirements in the PD district standards. In cases where development is
proposed next to an existing PD district having no perimeter buffer, the proposed development shall provide a perimeter buffer that is
consistent with the type of buffer required if the adjacent use was in a differing base district appropriate for the type of use.
[3] Mobile home parks shall provide a perimeter buffer around the park in accordance with the standards in Section 30-4.C.2.a.4, Manufa
Home Parks.
6. Responsibility for Buffer Installation
a. Vacant Parcels
Where a developing parcel is adjacent to a vacant parcel and a perimeter buffer is required in
accordance with this section, the developing parcel may reduce the planting schedule indicated in
Table 30-5.B.4.d.4, Property Perimeter Buffer Types, by one-half.
b. Existing Land Uses
Where a developing parcel is adjacent to an existing use and a perimeter buffer is required in
accordance with this section, the developing parcel shall provide the full perimeter buffer required
adjacent to the existing use in accordance with Table 30-5.B.4.d.4, Property Perimeter Buffer Types,
and Table 30-5.B.4.d.5, Buffer Type Application, unless a portion or all of a perimeter buffer that
complies with the standards of this section already exists between the lots. Where part of a
perimeter buffer exists, but the buffer does not fully comply with the standards of this section, the
developing parcel may reduce the planting schedule indicated in Table 30-5.B.4.d.4, Property
Perimeter Buffer Types, by one-half.
7. Location of Buffers
Perimeter buffers required by this section shall be located along the outer perimeter of the parcel(s)
under development and shall extend to the parcel boundary line. In the case of parcel boundary lines
along a public right-of-way, solid fencing in excess of 36 inches, if provided, shall not encroach beyond
the building setback line unless part of an approved Alternative Landscape Plan. A perimeter buffer may
be located along shared access easements between parcels in nonresidential developments. If a utility
or drainage easement is needed along a property line where a buffer is required, the buffer will be
repositioned to align with the outer edge of the easement, rather than the property line, in order to
accommodate both purposes without con_lict. No trees are to be planted within a drainage or utility
easement except as allowed on a case by case basis by the appropriate authority.
8. Development within Required Buffers
a. Unless permitted in this section, the required buffer shall not contain any development, impervious
surfaces, or site features that do not function to meet the standards of this section or that require
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 764/938
removal of existing vegetation.
b. Sidewalks and trails may be placed in perimeter buffers if all required landscaping is provided and
damage to existing vegetation is minimized according to Section 30-5.B.8, Tree Protection During
Construction.
c. Overhead and underground utilities may cross a perimeter buffer.
d. If required landscaping material is damaged or removed due to utility activity, the landowner shall
be responsible for replanting all damaged or removed vegetation necessary to ensure the buffer
meets the standards in this Article, unless otherwise provided for by the subject easement
agreement.
e. Screening
1. General Requirements
Screening shall be required to conceal speci_ic areas of high visual or auditory impact or hazardous
areas from both on-site and off-site views (see Figure 30-5.B.4.e, Screening Methods). Such areas shall
be screened at all times, unless otherwise speci_ied, regardless of adjacent uses, districts, or other
proximate landscaping material.
2. Items to Be Screened
The following areas shall be screened from off-site views in accordance with this section:
a. Large waste receptacles (dumpsters) and refuse collection points (including cardboard recycling
containers);
b. Loading and service areas;
c. Outdoor storage areas (including storage tanks);
d. To the extent feasible given access requirements, ground-based utility equipment in excess of 12
cubic feet; and
e. Ground level mechanical units, from public streets only.
Figure 30-5.B.4.e: Screening Methods
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 765/938
Vegeta_on can serve as an effec_ve visual screen for service areas.
3. Screening Methods
The following items are permitted for use as screening materials. Alternative screening materials that
are not listed may be used if it is determined they are comparable to these screening materials.
a. Vegetative materials that meet the minimum vegetative screening requirements for a Type D buffer
(see Table 30-5.B.4.d.4, Property Perimeter Buffer Types) and the size standards of Section 30-
5.B.3.e.2, New Plantings;
b. An earthen berm that is at least two feet in height, covered with grass, or planted with ground
cover landscaping materials consistent with the function of and requirements for a Type D buffer
(see Table 30-5.B.4.d.4, Property Perimeter Buffer Types)—provided, however, that a berm shall not
be used in the DT district or if it will replace existing trees of six inches in caliper or more;
c. A solid fence constructed of treated or rot-resistant wood (such as cypress or redwood), or a plastic
or vinyl fence, of a minimum height necessary to fully-screen the object being screened; or
d. A masonry wall that is the minimum height necessary to fully-screen the object being screened, and
that is constructed of brick, textured concrete masonry units, or stuccoed block.
e. Use of chain link fencing with wooden or plastic slats does not qualify as a screen.
f. Alternative Landscape Plan
1. General
Alternative Landscape Plans, materials, or methods may be justi_ied due to natural conditions, such as
streams, natural rock formations, topography, and physical conditions related to the site. Lot
con_iguration and utility easements may justify an alternative landscape plan, as well as impractical
situations that would result from application of Section 30-5.B, Landscaping and Tree Protection
Standards, or when replacing a tree accidentally damaged in accordance with Section 30-5.B.8, Tree
Protection During Construction.
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 766/938
2. Preparation
The alternative landscape plan should be prepared by someone who is knowledgeable about plant
material.
3. Allowable Deviations
With input from the TRC or the City Arborist, the city manager shall approve an Alternative Landscape
Plan if it meets the purpose and intent of the landscaping standards in this section. Allowable deviations
from the standards of this section include, but are not limited to the following:
a. Reduced Planting Rates due to Public Facilities
An adjustment to planting locations or reduction of up to 20 percent in the type or total number of
plant material may be allowed at underground and/or above ground facilities operated and
maintained by a utility, unless speci_ic written consent is provided by that utility. An adjustment or
reduction may also be allowed where public easements or right-of-way, are located upon or in close
proximity to the parcel.
b. Reduction in Standards due to Nature of Parcel
A reduction in the count, spacing, or species diversity standards by up to 20 percent may be allowed
where the reduction is desirable in terms of protection of existing natural resources, better
consistency with the goals of the comprehensive plan, or a site design that exceeds the quality of
what would otherwise result under a strict application of the standards in this Article.
c. Redevelopment of Nonconforming Sites
The installation of required landscaping during redevelopment of existing nonconforming sites shall
occur in accordance with Section 30-7.F, Nonconforming Sites.
d. Location of Street Trees
1. Deviations in the placement, on-center spacing, or tree type (understory vs. canopy) are
allowable from the standards in Section 30-5.B.4.a, Street Trees, when the deviation is consistent
with existing street tree placement along the same or adjacent block faces.
2. An applicant may request, or the City may require payment-in-lieu of street trees in cases where a
development's frontage is subject to an approved streetscape plan.

30-5.B.5. Public Tree Protec_on Standards
a. Purpose
1. The purpose of this section is to recognize the valuable asset the City has in the trees planted by public
entities over the years and to encourage the protection of trees along streets and on City grounds within
the City limits, because they are a continuing asset to the sound development of the City.
2. To accomplish this purpose, this section:
a. Establishes standard procedures and practices for the treatment of trees on public property, when
conditions require that they be pruned or removed, and of trees on private property, when City
crews are required to correct or abate certain conditions set out in this section;
b. De_ines those situations in which trees growing on private property may constitute a public
nuisance; and
c. Encourages the planting of trees on public property in conformity with these standards.
3. This section is not intended to be punitive or to cause hardship to any person who uses care and
diligence to protect public trees.
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 767/938
b. Applicability
This section pertains to all trees that exist on public lands and within public right-of-way.
c. Exemptions
Installation and maintenance activities conducted by utility providers within utility easements, public
lands, or public right-of-way shall be exempt from the standards in this section when in con_lict with
service and/or easement maintenance requirements.
d. Tree Board
1. Creation and Establishment;
There is hereby created and established a City Tree Board. The Joint Appearance Commission members
appointed by City Council shall hereby be designated as the City's Tree Board.
2. Duties and Responsibilities
a. It shall be the responsibility of the Tree Board to assist in the study, development and preparation of
a written plan for the care, replacement, maintenance, and removal or disposition of trees and
shrubs in parks, along streets and in other public areas.
b. The Tree Board, when requested by the City Council, shall consider, investigate, make _indings, report
and recommend upon any special matter or question coming within the scope of its work.
c. The City Arborist shall be used as advisor when dif_iculties arise.
e. Public Tree Care
1. The City Manager or PWC shall have the right to plant, prune, maintain and remove trees, plants and
shrubs within the right-of-way or bounds of all streets, alleys, lanes, squares, and public grounds, or any
that extend into the right-of-way, if it endangers the safety of the public, or if it harbors disease or
insects in order to preserve or enhance the beauty of such public places.
2. Pruning of trees shall be in conformance with ANSI (American National Standards Institute) pruning
standards as published by the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA).
3. The City Manager or PWC may remove or cause to be removed by the appropriate agency/contractor,
any tree or part thereof which is in an unsafe condition or which by reason of its nature is injurious to
sewers, electric power lines, gas lines, water lines, or other public improvements, or is seriously
affected with any injurious insect or disease.
f. Permit Required
No person shall plant or remove a street tree or other public tree without _irst obtaining a permit from the
City Manager. An encroachment agreement may also be needed for NCDOT maintained roads. No permit
shall be required by any public service or City employee during such work in the pursuit of their public
service endeavors.
g. Tree Topping
It shall be unlawful for any person, _irm, or City department to top any street tree, park tree, or other tree

3. Land-disturbing activities within _ive feet of a public tree shall incorporate protection for tree root
areas in accordance with best practices accepted by the City Manager.
k. Dead or Diseased Trees
The City may remove or cause to be removed any dead or diseased tree within the City limits that is
declared by the City Arborist to be a public health nuisance pursuant to North Carolina General Statute
Section 160A-193. The City will notify in writing the owner of such trees, and removal shall be in
accordance with Section 30-8.E.4.b, Notice of Violation. If the owner does not abate the public health
nuisance within a reasonable time,the City Manager may proceed without notice to abate the unlawful
conduct and charge the actual cost of abatement, which shall be a lien upon the property in accordance
with Section 160A-193.
l. Removal of Stumps
All stumps of public trees within the public right-of-way shall be removed below the surface of the ground
so that the top of the stump shall not project above the surface of the ground.
m. Interference with Tree Maintenance
It shall be unlawful for any person to prevent, delay, or interfere with any of the City's representatives or
agents, while engaging in and about the planting, cultivating, mulching, pruning, spraying, or removing of
any tree within the community forest, as authorized by this section.
n. Permission and Insurance Required
It shall be unlawful for any person or _irm to engage in the business or occupation of pruning, treating, or
removing any publicly-owned treet without _irst obtaining permission from the City. Permission shall not
be required for any PWC, public service, or City employee. The person or _irm shall _irst _ile evidence of
possession of liability insurance in the minimum amounts of $1,000,000.00 for bodily injury or death, and
$100,000.00 property damage indemnifying the City or any person injured or damaged resulting from the
pursuit of such endeavors as described in this article.
o. Appeal
The Zoning Commission shall have the right to review the conduct, acts, and decisions of the Tree Board.

(Ord. No. S2012-016, § 4.0, 9-10-2012; Ord. No. S2015-018, § 1, 12-14-2015; Ord. No. S2019-013, 1,
04/23/2019)
30-5.B.6. Tree Preserva_on
a. Purpose and Intent
The purpose and intent of this section is to:
1. Recognize the importance of the existing tree canopy and natural features such as native tree groves
and stands of hardwood trees;
2. Recognize the importance of existing trees to the visual and natural environments in the City; and
3. Protect and retain signi_icant tree masses and specimen trees during and after development;
4. Establish the criteria for removal of a healthy specimen tree; and
5. Set out the required mitigation for removal of a healthy specimen tree.
b. Applicability
1. General
All development in the City, except that exempted in accordance with Section 30-5.B.6.b.2, Exemptions
(below), shall be required to protect trees in accordance with this section.
2. Exemptions
The following development shall be exempt from these standards:
a. Land within the Downtown (DT) district;
b. Existing single-family detached residential dwellings except for trees planted to ful_ill the street tree
requirements of Section 30-5.B.4.a; and
c. Installation and maintenance activities conducted by utility providers within utility easements,
public lands, or public right-of-way.
c. Review for Compliance
Review for compliance with the standards of this section shall occur as part of an application for a Clear-
Cutting Permit (Section 30-2.C.9), Site Plan (Section 30-2.C.5), Planned Development (Section 30-2.C.3), or
Subdivision Plan (Section 30-2.C.6), as appropriate.
d. Tree Survey
Generally a tree survey is only required to illustrate the location, species, caliper, and condition of existing
trees on the development site which the developer is proposing to save and for which he/she shall receive
landscaping or open space credit (see Section 30-5.B.7, Tree Preservation Incentives and Section 30-5.C.4,
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 770/938
Bonuses and Incentives); however, a tree survey is required for the purposes of documenting any tree
having a caliper of 30 inches or greater. This information is used by the city manager in determining the
exact location and extent of the required tree protection zone.
e. Specimen Trees De_ined; Provisions for Removal
1. Specimen trees de_ined.
Any healthy tree with a caliper measurement meeting or exceeding 30 inches shall be considered to be a
specimen tree unless exempted under Section 30-5.B.7.a.2.
2. Provisions for removal.
Removal of specimen trees, while strongly discouraged, may sometimes be necessary due to the
location of a tree or trees on a site or the size of the site. Applicants desiring to remove specimen tree(s)
shall present compelling site design arguments for such removal, such as lot size, building placement,
driveway and other vehicular use area layout, and similar considerations or constraints to justify
removal. Applicants shall familiarize themselves with the incentives for preserving specimen trees in
Section 30-5.C.4, Bonuses and Incentives. If justi_ied by site design considerations or constraints and the
incentives for preservation are deemed insuf_icient by the applicant, specimen trees may be removed
upon payment of $50.00 per caliper inch of the removed tree(s) into the City's tree fund.
f. Champion Big Trees
No tree listed in the North Carolina Big Trees List, the American Forest Association's Champion Tree list or
any tree that would measure 80 percent of the points of a tree on the North Carolina Big Trees List shall be
pruned or removed without prior permission from the City Arborist.
(Ord. No. S2012-016, § 4.0, 9-10-2012; Ord. No. S2013-015, §§ 3.9—3.12, 7-22-2013; Ord. No. S2019-051, § 1,
09/23/2019)
30-5.B.7. Tree Preserva_on Incen_ves
a. Tree Preservation Credits
The preservation of specimen trees and other existing trees within the site and at the property perimeter is
strongly encouraged. As an incentive to encourage the preservation of as many trees as practical on a
development site, credit towards the minimum landscaping requirements may be applied to all existing
trees in good health and condition which are retained as long as the intent and applicable standards of this
section are fully met. Credits shall be granted in accordance with the following standards:
1. Qualifying Attributes
Preserved vegetation must be in good health and condition, and must be protected as described in
Section 30-5.B.8, Tree Protection During Construction.
2. Exempted Trees
The following trees, regardless of their size, shall be exempted from the requirements in this section.
a. Southern Yellow Pine (to exclude Longleaf Pine);
b. Bradford Pear;
c. Mulberry; and
d. Silver Maple.
Table 30-5.B.7.a: Exis_ng Tree Credits
SIZE OF EXISTING TREE NUMBER OF TREES TO BE CREDITED

online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 771/938
3. Tree Death
If a preserved tree dies within 24 months of the completion of the landscape project, it must be
replaced with the total number of trees which were credited to the existing tree, and the size of the new
tree must comply with the size requirements for new trees as established in this section.
b. Credit Toward Open Space
If specimen trees or groves of three or more trees over four-inch caliper are preserved and protected
during development of the site (beyond those credited toward landscaping requirements), credit may be
applied toward the required open space acreage by calculating the area of the critical root zone
circumference and multiplying that square footage by three, deriving a 300 percent credit. (See also
Section 30-5.C.4, Bonuses and Incentives.)
c. Reduction in the Minimum Number of Required Parking Spaces
Up to a _ive percent reduction in the number of off-street parking spaces required on a development site
shall be allowed if the reduction in the amount of required pavement will preserve the root zones of
existing healthy specimen trees. The amount of reduction can be determined only after taking into
consideration any unique site conditions and the impact of the reduction on parking needs for the use, and
must be agreed upon by both the applicant and the City Manager. Alternative paving materials (see Section
30-5.A.8.i, Alternative Materials) may be required by the City Manager in cases where required parking
areas encroach upon critical root zones.
(Ord. No. S2012-016, § 4.0, 9-10-2012; Ord. No. S2013-002, § 11, 2-11-2013; Ord. No. S2013-015, §§ 3.13—
3.15, 7-22-2013; Ord. No. S2019-006, 1, 04/23/2019)
30-5.B.8. Tree Protec_on during Construc_on
a. Responsibility for Compliance
No grading or other land-disturbing activity shall occur on a site with existing trees, until protective
barriers are installed by the owner or his/her representative, except in cases where no trees are being
preserved. All protective barriers must be maintained throughout site and building construction. Failure to
comply with the standards in this section is a violation of this Ordinance, subject to the remedies and
penalties in this section and Article 30-8: Enforcement.
b. Critical Root Zone
Critical to the tree's survival is protection of the critical root zone. The critical root zone is the minimum
area beneath a tree that must be left undisturbed in order to preserve a suf_icient root mass to give a tree a
reasonable chance of survival. The critical root zone is generally 18 to 24 inches deep and typically
represented by a concentric circle centering on the tree trunk with a radius of at least one foot for every
inch of trunk diameter taken at four and one-half feet above grade (DBH). Approximately 50 percent of a
tree's root system is in the top 12 inches of soil with 90—95 percent of the root system within the top
three feet. For example, a ten-inch diameter tree requires a protective barrier with a minimum ten-foot
radius. Proposed buildings shall not be located within ten feet of the critical root zone of any existing tree
proposed to be preserved.

3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 772/938
c. Tree Protection Fencing
Without protection, trees will be damaged and killed by construction activity; however, such damage is
not immediately evident. The protective fencing indicates the areas that are off limits to any land
disturbing activity, and storage of equipment, building material, soil, and other debris.
1. When and Where Required
All trees designated for preservation must be protected by barrier before demolition, grading, or any
other land disturbing activity begins. Protective barriers shall be installed when the critical root zone of
any trees to be preserved are within 50 feet of any proposed grading or construction activity.
2. Illustrated on Plans
Tree protection areas based on the trees' critical root zones shall be noted and drawn to scale on
demolition plans, grading and erosion control plans, and landscaping plans. Demolition plans shall
include a detail of the tree barrier fencing to be erected and a note that site clearing is not to commence
until tree protection barriers are in place and have been inspected by the City. Construction areas shall
be located outside of tree protection areas, as noted by limit of construction barriers. Any proposed
change of grade within a required tree protection zone must be avoided, but when absolutely
necessary, shall be clearly conveyed on the plans. Any anticipated disturbance to the tree protection
zone must be approved prior to construction, otherwise the tree will not qualify as preserved and
penalties will ensue. Additionally, all tree save areas must be described by metes and bounds on the
recorded plat, individual recorded deeds, and all property association documents for land held in
common.
3. Type of Fencing and Noticing
All fencing required by this section shall be a minimum of four feet high, visible, and of durable
construction with signage indicating "Keep Out." Protective barriers shall consist of either:
a. A fence which is at least four feet high and constructed in a post and rail con_iguration, using two by
four rails; or
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 773/938
b. A fence with two by four posts placed a maximum distance of ten feet apart covered with four foot
orange polyethylene laminar safety fencing.
4. Inspection
All tree protection measures may be subject to inspection. Failure to have tree protection measures in
place prior to the start of demolition and land clearing activity is a violation of this Article. Protective
tree barriers shall be maintained until after the _inal site inspection.
d. Encroachments into Tree Protection Zones
No credit will be allowed for any tree proposed to be retained, if there is any encroachment within the tree
protection zone, except as noted herein. For the purpose of this section, an encroachment is de_ined as any
change in the natural grade, construction of impervious surfaces, trenching or excavation, storage of
equipment, chemicals, materials or earth and the temporary or permanent parking or circulation of
vehicles or equipment. Encroachments into tree protection zones shall occur only when no other
alternative exists. If such an encroachment is anticipated, a written request must be made to the City
Manager for allowance of encroachment. Request must detail preventative measures to be taken.
1. Soil Compaction
Where compaction might occur due to construction traf_ic or materials delivery through a tree
protection zone, the area must _irst be mulched with a minimum four-inch layer of wood chips.
Equipment or materials storage shall not be allowed within a tree save area.
2. Fill
No _ill shall be placed within a tree protection zone without appropriate horticultural measures to
allow air and water to reach the roots.
3. Paving Limitations
Construction of sidewalks or permeable parking or driveway access points may encroach into tree
protection zones, so long as such areas are approved by the City Manager and the following conditions
are met:
a. No more than ten percent of the protected ground area (including any additional landscape planting
area) may be covered by sidewalks, up to 20 percent of this area may be covered by permeable
parking areas or driveway access points or a combination of sidewalks and permeable parking or
driveway access areas;
b. Sidewalks shall be raised to avoid root damage; private sidewalks may be constructed with asphalt if
a concrete or brick sidewalk would damage the tree's roots; and
c. Permeable paving shall provide water and gaseous exchange to the tree roots, and the existing grade
shall not be lowered or raised, except that the _inished paved surface may be an average of six inches
above the existing grade.

(Ord. S2013-023, 10/28/2013)
b. Nature of Open Space to be Dedicated
1. Trees Required
Open space areas shall be planted with a minimum of 24 trees per acre unless otherwise speci_ied or as
approved by city manager (exceptions may include sports _ields, areas with urban amenities, etc.)
Composition of the Open Space may include a variety of features and facilities as described below:
2. Usability of Dedicated Land
At least 50 percent of the dedicated land is to be usable for active or passive recreational facilities and
shall be planned and improved with those facilities which support such use. Development plans shall
include details of these facilities.
Facilities may include, but are not limited to, tennis courts, swimming pools, clubhouses, athletic _ields,
basketball courts, play grounds, open play areas, community gardens, roof gardens, green roofs,
sidewalks, multi-use trails, picnic facilities, and urban amenities such as plazas and fountains. If in
question, the usability of the dedicated land shall be at the determination of the city manager.
Figure 30-5.C.3.b.2: Open Space Configura_on
Wherever possible, open space dedica_ons should con_nue or expand exis_ng open space resources.
3. Size and Location
a. The open space dedication should generally be concentrated in a single tract of land that
encompasses the open space and its associated improvement, if any, regardless of whether the
development is occurring in phases or sections. Exceptions may be provided at the discretion of the
city manager based upon a determination that multiple or smaller tracts better serve the
development or the interests of the City.
b. Residential open space should generally be centrally located and within ¼ mile of 80 percent of the
lots or units. The city manager may require that trail easements or open space be dedicated on the
periphery of the development in order to allow enlargement of future trail facilities or public parks
when deemed to be in the best interest of the City's current and/or long-range parks and recreation
plans (see Figure 30-5.C.3.b.2, Open Space Con_iguration).
4. Access
Access shall be free, easy, and convenient to and from the open space area.

Figure 30-5.C.3.b.7: Stormwater Ameni_es
Stormwater management devices configured as a site amenity
may be credited towards open space requirements.
a. In residential areas, the access shall be provided by means of streets and sidewalks, walkways, or
trail, with access right-of-way being a minimum width of 20 feet shown on the Site Plan or
Subdivision Plan.
b. All publicly dedicated open space areas shall have access by way of a public street. Dedicated areas
that do not have frontage on a public street but are adjacent to existing or proposed public open
space with access are exempt from this requirement, but may be required to provide
pedestrian/bicycle access from the adjacent neighborhood.
5. Conservation Features
Conservation features such as the following
may be counted toward the open space
requirement:
a. The 100-year _loodplain;
b. Wetlands under the jurisdiction of the Army
Corps of Engineers or the State of North
Carolina;
c. Non-jurisdictional wetlands not under the
jurisdiction of the Army Corps of Engineers
or the State of North Carolina;
d. Wildlife corridors or habitat utilized by
endangered or threatened species;

preservation of signi_icant trees;
f. Natural _ields and meadows;
g. Prime agricultural lands that remain in agricultural use;
h. Scenic corridors and views;
i. Historic, archeological, and cultural resources; and/or
j. Areas that could serve to extend existing public facilities, such as greenways, trails, parks or
recreation areas.
6. Open Water Areas
No more than 50 percent of the total open space dedication may be comprised of open water (lakes,
natural ponds, streams, rivers, etc.).
7. Stormwater Management Devices
a. Up to 100 percent of land area occupied by stormwater management devices (including retention
ponds, fully vegetated detention basins, and other bio-retention devices, but not pervious pavement
or underground storage devices) may be counted toward the total open space dedication
requirement in accordance with Section 30-5.C.4, Bonuses and Incentives.
b. A living green roof may be installed and maintained to satisfy all or a portion of the open space
dedication. The owner may be required to submit an annual inspection and maintenance report as
outlined in the City's landscaping guidelines.
c. Not Counted as Open Space
The following areas shall not be counted as open space dedication:

6. Designated outdoor storage areas.
d. Provision in Multi-Phase Developments
Multi-phase development shall preserve open space in phases, so that the _irst phase of development does
not contain 100 percent of the open space acreage allotted for the entire development, but does contain, at
a minimum, its pro rata share of the total acreage. One hundred percent may be provided in the initial
phase if the open space is central to the overall Site Plan and con_igured such that all phases will have
reasonable access to the open space facilities.
e. Maintenance of Open Space Dedicated Areas
The owner of the land shall be responsible for maintenance of all open space dedicated areas. Failure to
maintain open space areas or other community facilities in accordance with the approved Final Plat

30-5.C.5. Density Bonus Available
A density bonus over and above the density otherwise allowed may be approved by the City Manager
provided that the petitioner increase the percentage of the total project area to be dedicated to common
open space. This bonus may be granted only if speci_ically requested by the petitioner. Any such bonus shall
consist of a one percent increase in allowable density for every one percent of land area devoted to common
open space in addition to the ten percent required herein. The increase in density shall be achieved through
administrative adjustment to lot area and lot width to allow clustering. In no event shall the bonus exceed 20
percent of the otherwise allowable density.
(Ord. No. S2012-017, § 5.5, 9-10-2012)
30-5.C.6. Determining Ownership of Open Space Dedica_on or Payment-in-Lieu
The city manager shall review all proposals concerning open space dedication with consideration given for
relevant park plans adopted by the City and shall decide whether a payment-in-lieu of dedication or whether
one of the following ownership options for dedicated acreage is acceptable:
a. Ownership Options
The open space dedication shall be clearly conveyed on the Site Plan, or the Final Plat, through recorded
easement or separate tract, as appropriate.
1. Retained on Private Lots
All required open space dedicated areas to be retained under private ownership on an individual
building lot shall be maintained through the use of a recorded easement prohibiting future development
of the open space except in accordance with this section. Exceptions may be provided at the discretion
of the city manager, depending upon the type and acreage of the designated open space.
Such open space dedication shall be clearly marked on the Site Plan, or the Subdivision Plan and Final
Plat, as appropriate. Exceptions may be provided at the discretion of the city manager based upon a
determination that multiple or smaller tracts better serve the development or the interests of the City.
2. Homeowners or Property Owners Association
Developments having over 20 lots, shall designate open space dedicated areas as a separate tract on the
Subdivision Plan and Final Recorded Plat, to be held in joint or common ownership, through a
recognized homeowners or property owners association, established in accordance with the following:
a. The landowner shall submit documents for the creation of the homeowners or property owners
association to the City for review and approval, including the association's bylaws, all documents
governing ownership, maintenance, and use restrictions for the open space dedication, and a legal
description of open space dedication areas.
b. The landowner shall agree that the association shall be established by the landowner or applicant
and shall be operating (with _inancial subsidization by the owner or applicant, if necessary) before
issuance of the _irst Building Permit.
c. Membership in the association shall be automatic (mandatory) for all purchasers of land, dwelling
units, or structures in the development, and their successors in title.
d. The association shall be responsible for liability insurance and local taxes on common open space
owned by it. Any fees levied by the association that remain unpaid will become a lien on the
individual property in accordance with procedures established under the dedication or organization
document. The covenants and easements shall also prohibit future development of any common
open space, for other than open space or recreational purposes, and shall provide for continued
maintenance of any common open space and recreational facilities.
3. Nonpro_it Organization
The landowners may convey open space to a nonpro_it organization such as a land trust or land
conservancy for management and maintenance if the City is provided adequate assurance the
dedication will be properly managed and maintained.
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 779/938
4. Public Dedication and Conveyance
The landowners may convey open space dedication to the City for public use, maintenance and
management. This option requires the consent of the city manager to accept the open space area for
public use.
b. Timing
The process to dedicate open space acreage or pay a fee-in-lieu for a portion of the open space
requirements must be completed prior to the issuance of the Final Site Plan or Subdivision Plan approval.
All open space improvements and facilities must be completed no later than the date on which certi_icates
of occupancy are issued for the _irst 50 percent of the total number of dwelling units to be constructed
within the project area.
c. Voluntary Payment-In-Lieu
1. Procedure for Approval
a. The payment of such fees in-lieu shall be reviewed and approved as part of the Site Plan (Section 30-
2.C.5), or Final Plat (Section 30-2.C.6.e), as appropriate. Any developer desiring to make such in-lieu
fee payment shall attach a formal written request to the city manager.
b. Upon receipt of the application, the city manager shall review the request and decide if it is in the
best interest of the community to require dedication of open space or accept a payment-inlieu based
on the standards in Section 30-5.C.3, Open Space Standards.
c. Appeals of the decision of the city manager or the Technical Review Committee on the provision of
open space dedication shall be decided by the City Council in accordance with Section 30-2.C.18,
Appeal.
2. Amount of Payment
a. The payment-in-lieu shall be calculated based upon the square footage of land required for
dedication, consistent with the requirements of Table 30-5.C.3, Required Open Space Dedication. The
land value factor contained in the fee schedule adopted annually by the City Council will be applied
to the land area required for dedication to arrive at the payment-in-lieu amount.
b. For developments and subdivisions containing more than 20 residential units, the payment-in-lieu
option may only be used for up to 50 percent of the open space requirements in order to ensure that
these larger projects provide on-site open space for their residents.
3. Use of Funds
Funds collected shall be maintained in a separate account and shall be used only for the acquisition or
development of open space, greenway, trails, park, and recreation areas and/or to implement features
of the Parks and Recreation Master Plan of the City of Fayetteville. Where practical, the collected fees
for each project shall be designated for speci_ic parks and recreation acquisitions and/or enhancements
by the City Manager.

the indiscriminate placement and unsightliness of fences and walls, and ensure the safety, security, and
privacy of properties.
30-5.D.2. Applicability
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 780/938
a. The provisions of this section shall apply to all construction, substantial reconstruction, or replacement of
fences or walls not required for support of a principal or accessory structure, or any other linear
barrier intended to delineate different portions of a lot; however, garden walls as described in Section 30-
5.B.4.c.5.d are exempt from these requirements.
b. Temporary fences for construction sites or a similar purpose are exempted from these standards, but shall
comply with the requirements of the State Building Code adopted by the City, and the standards of
Section 30-4.E, Temporary Use Standards.
c. Bona _ide farming and related agricultural uses for properties within the State’s present-use program must
meet the standards of Section 30-5.D along any property line or public right of way but are allowed barbed
wire and electric fencing typical of farm operations, up to _ive feet in height, when such fencing is placed
inside a perimeter fence.
d. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this section and any screening standard
in Section 30-5.B.4.e, Screening, the screening standards shall govern.
(Ord. No. S2012-016, § 12.0, 9-10-2012; Ord. No. S2014-004, § 8, 1-13-2014; Ord. No. S2014-021, § 1a, 11-24-
2014.)
30-5.D.3. Loca_onal Requirements for Fences and Walls
a. General
1. Fences or walls shall be located outside of the public right-of-way, and may not exceed 30 inches in
height if located within a required sight triangle.
2. Fences and walls are permitted on the property line between two or more parcels of land held in private
ownership.
3. Fences and walls may be located within any required yard.
b. In Easements or Around Fire Protection Facilities
Fences which cannot easily be removed, or that prevent access, shall be prohibited within utility
easements or around _ire protection facilities, and the City shall not be responsible for damage to, or the
repair or replacement of, fences that must be removed to access such easements or facilities. Any
fencing shall also meet the minimum separation distance required by the current adopted version of
the North Carolina Fire Code.
c. Blocking Natural Drainage Flow
No fence or wall shall be installed so as to block or divert a natural drainage _low on to or off of any
other land unless subject to an approved stormwater management plan. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to prevent the installation of temporary fencing to protect existing trees, limit sedimentation, or
control erosion.
d. Within Buffers
1. Fences and walls shall be installed so as not to disturb or damage existing vegetation or plant material
installed to meet the requirements of this code, to the maximum extent practicable. If removed, plant
material installed to meet the requirements of this Code shall be replaced. The perimeter fencing or
wall for a single development shall be of a uniform style that complies with the standards of this
section.
2. Fences or walls used to meet buffer requirements and placed so that the required plant material is
interior to the fences or walls shall be solid with a minimum of three horizontal elements and two
vertical elements if made of wood or a minimum of two vertical and horizontal elements if of masonry
construction. Alternately, a professionally installed “green wall” may be used provided the vegetation is
placed to allow maintenance and full wall coverage by the vegetation is achieved within 24 months
after installation (also see Section 30-5.B.4.c.5.d Garden Walls). Figure 30-5.D.3.d shows examples of
these fences and walls. Chain link with slats or screens, shadow box or other partially open fences are
not allowed.

NOTES:
1. Measurement of Height: Fence and wall height shall be measured taking into account the purpose for the fence or wall. For
example, a buffer fence erected on the top of a retaining wall shall have its height measured from the adjoining property, not the
base of the retaining wall. Similarly, a fence or wall erected as a buffer between the property being developed at a lower elevation
from the property being buffered shall have its height measured from the property being buffered, not the lower property being
developed. Fences erected for security purposes shall have that purpose taken into account when determining how they are
measured. Nothing herein, however, shall allow or require the erection of a buffer fence or wall taller than twelve feet as
measured from the lower property side, unless erected on a retaining wall. Safety fencing required by the North Carolina building
code is not regulated by these height provisions.
2. Only allowed as part of an approved tennis court, athletic _ield, or similar recreational amenity.
3. Reserved for future use.
4. Single-family (attached or detached) and two- to four-family dwellings on through lots shall be considered as having two front
yards except as follows:
Where the lot adjoins a road with four or more lanes, the frontage adjoining this road may be considered a corner side yard with
regard to fence height and setback
Where the fence or wall is part of a development perimeter.
5. For single-family (attached or detached) and two- to four-family dwellings, the following fence and wall materials are allowed
for fences erected in the front yard:
a. Wrought iron or similar open-style metal fence (for these fences, the front yard height may be increased to _ive feet);
b. Picket, shadow box or other partially open fences (50% or more open); or
c. Solid fences or walls (less than 50% open) containing a minimum of three horizontal elements and two vertical
elements if made of wood or a minimum of two vertical and horizontal elements if of masonry construction.
d. Chain link or other wire fences with or without slats or screens are not allowed.
6. For all properties having road frontage, a garden wall (Sec. 30-5.B.4(c)(5) d.) may be substituted for a fence or wall allowed in
this section.
7. Where property lines extend into the right-of-way, the setback for fences and walls in front and corner side yards shall be
measured from the edge of the sidewalk (if any) or 10 feet from the edge of the pavement, as applicable.
8. For development other than single-family, wrought iron or similar open-style fence, the height may be increased to _ive feet.
b. Exemption for Safety
Major utilities, wireless communication towers, government facilities, and other public safety uses shall
be allowed to increase maximum fence heights to eight feet in front, side, and rear yards, unless further
increased through an approved Security Plan (see Section 30-5.D.5 Exemptions).
(Ord. No. S2012-016, § 5.1, 9-10-2012; Ord. No. S2013-002, § 3, 2-11-2013; Ord. No. S2014-021, § 1c, 11-24-

30-5.D.5. Exemp_ons
a. Security Plan:
An owner or tenant or a representative of an agency responsible to or for a government facility, park and
open area, public safety, or other use where sensitive, dangerous, or military-related activities take
place may submit a site Security Plan to the City for consideration. A Security Plan may propose fences or
walls taller than those permitted by this subsection, the use of barbed or concertina wire atop a fence or
wall, or "K-4" fencing. The City Manager shall approve or approve with conditions, the Security Plan
and its proposed exemption of fences or walls from the standards of this subsection, upon _inding that:
1. The condition, location, or use of the land, or the history of activity in the area, indicates the land or
any materials stored or used on it are in signi_icantly greater danger of theft or damage than
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 783/938
surrounding land, or represent a signi_icant hazard to public safety without a taller fence or the use of
barbed or concertina wire atop a fence or wall; and
2. The proposed taller fences or wall or use of barbed or concertina wire will not have a signi_icant
adverse effect on the security, functioning, appearance, or value of adjacent lands or the
surrounding area as a whole.
b. Monitored Electri_ied Fences:
The construction and use of monitored electri_ied fences shall be permitted in the LI and HI industrial
districts and may be approved through a Special Use Permit for electric security around permitted
outdoor storage or warehouse-type activity in the CC district provided the following standards are met:
1. Electri_ication
The energizer for electric fences must be driven by a commercial storage battery not to exceed 12 V DC.
Additionally, the electric charge produced by the fence upon contact shall not exceed the energizer
characteristics set forth in paragraph 22.108 and depicted in Figure 102 of the International Electro
Technical Commission (IEC) Standard No. 60335-2-76.
2. Perimeter fence or wall
No electric fence shall be installed or used unless it is completely surrounded by a nonelectrical fence
or wall that is not less than six feet in height. In no case shall the nonelectrical fence or wall exceed the
maximum height allowed in the underlying zoning district for such structures, and in no case shall
the electric fence be taller than two feet higher than the nonelectrical fence.
3. Location
Electric fences shall be restricted in location to the same areas where other fences are allowed in
the underlying zoning district except that in no instance other than outdoor storage as a principal use
shall electric fences be placed in the front setback area or between the front building façade and street.
4. Warning signs
Electric fences shall be clearly identi_ied with warning signs that are spaced 60 feet apart. Such signs
shall not exceed one square foot in area.
5. Accessibility
If required by the Fire Department, a Knox box shall be required and installed to support emergency
access to properties contained within electric fences.
6. Monitoring
Electric fences shall be equipped with a monitoring alarm system activated simultaneously with the
electri_ication of the fence.
7. Hold harmless/indemni_ication agreement
The owner of the electric fence and/or the owner of the property on which such fence is located shall
provide the City with a hold harmless/indemni_ication agreement in a form satisfactory to the City
Attorney prior to installation of the electric fence.
8. When allowed as a Special Use in the CC district, a monitored electri_ied fence shall be limited to
enclosing permitted outdoor storage areas or warehouse type uses or upon determination of sitespeci
_ic characteristics, such as compatibility with adjacent uses, preponderance of criminal activity,
site design issues such as isolated location or easy access to building entry, or criminally-targeted uses
involving indoor storage of chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and similar materials that require the
specialized protection of an electric fence. All other standards in this section shall be met.
(Ord. No. S2012-023, § 1, 10-8-2012)
30-5.D.6. Perimeter Fences and Walls Abu??ng Rights-of-Way
Fences or walls forming a perimeter around multiple buildings in a development and located within 15 feet
of a street or public right-of-way shall:
a. Be of a uniform style;
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 784/938
b. Be constructed of brick, stone, concrete, covered with stucco or similar _inish, vinyl, vertical wooden
board, wrought iron, aluminum, or other customary material;
c. Be located at least ten feet outside the public right-of-way;
d. Include breaks, offsets, access points, decorative columns, or other design details in the wall plane at
least every 100 feet as illustrated in Figure 30-5.D.6, Required Fencing Offsets; and
e. Comply with the requirements of Section 30-5.B.4.e, Screening.
Figure 30-5.D.6: Required Fencing Offsets
Off-sets and other features help enhance the appearance of fences or walls adjacent to public streets.
(Ord. No. S2012-016, § 12.0, 9-10-2012; Ord. No. S2014-021, § 1d, 11-24-2014)
30-5.D.7. Visibility Clearance
Fences and walls shall not exceed a maximum height of 30 inches when located within required sight
triangles or areas needed for visibility.
30-5.D.8. Prohibited Fences
a. Barbed Wire, Concertina Wire, and Aboveground Electri_ied Fences
In all zoning districts, fences using barbed or concertina wire and aboveground electri_ied fences shall be
prohibited unless allowed consistent with standards in Section 30-5.D.5 or through an approved Security
Plan (see Section 30-5.D.5, Exemptions). Underground electric fences designed for control of domestic
animals are allowed.
b. Debris, Junk, Rolled Plastic, Sheet Metal, Plywood, or Other Waste Materials
Fences or walls made of debris, junk, rolled plastic, sheet metal, plywood, or waste materials are
prohibited in all zoning districts unless such materials have been recycled and reprocessed, for
marketing to the general public, as building materials designed to resemble new building materials (e.g.,
picket fencing made from recycled plastic and _iber).
(Ord. No. S2012-023, § 2, 10-8-2012)
30-5.D.9. Appearance
a. Customary Materials
Fences and walls shall be constructed of any combination of treated wood posts and planks, rot-resistant
wood (such as cypress or redwood), wrought iron, decorative metal materials, chain link, brick, stone,
masonry materials, or products designed to resemble these materials. Where wood, masonry, or other
opaque materials are speci_ied for particular types of screening or buffering fences or walls, all other fence
materials are prohibited.
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 785/938
Figure 30-5.D.9.b: Fence Appearance
In cases where a fence is visible from a public street,
supports or internal bracing should face the interior of
the site.
b. Finished Side to Outside
Wherever a fence or wall is installed, if one side of the fence or wall appears more "_inished" than the
other (e.g., one side has visible support framing and the other does not), then the more "_inished" side of
the fence shall face the perimeter of the lot rather than the interior of the lot. Where practical dif_iculties
exist with regard to future maintenance of the fence and/or aesthetic issues are minimal, such as when a
fence on one property is installed in close proximity to an existing fence on another property or if the
fence being installed is a signi_icant distance away from any adjoining property or properties, the city
manager may waive or modify this requirement and may impose conditions for such waiver or
modi_ication.
c. Compatibility of Materials along a Single Lot
Side
All fencing or wall segments located along a
single lot side shall be composed of a uniform
style and colors compatible with other parts of
the fence and with the associated buildings.
d. Landscape Screening
1. As a means of softening the appearance of

similarly-situated or neighboring properties, such as loss of usable lot area.
30-5.E. Exterior Ligh_ng
30-5.E.1. Purpose
The purpose of this section is to regulate light trespass to ensure the safety of motorists and pedestrians, to
minimize any health and environmental impacts from high levels of arti_icial light at night, and to ensure
lighting does not adversely affect land uses on adjacent properties or uses dependent upon dark skies. More
speci_ically, this section is intended to:
a. Regulate lighting to assure that excessive light spillage and glare are not directed at adjacent properties,
neighboring areas, and motorists;
b. Ensure that all site lighting is designed and installed to maintain adequate lighting levels on site while
limiting negative lighting impacts on adjacent lands and upward re_lection or visibility that reduces dark
sky conditions; and
c. Provide security for persons and land.
30-5.E.2. Applicability
a. General
The provisions of this section shall apply to all development in the City unless exempted in accordance
with Section 30-5.E.3, Exemptions.

corridor from adjacent streets.
f. Internal Street Connectivity
1. Minimum Connectivity Index Score Required
Except in the AR and DT districts, all development shall achieve an internal street connectivity score in
accordance with Table 30-5.F.4.f, Minimum Street Connectivity Index:
Figure 30-5.F.4.f.2: Street Connec_vity Index
New internal streets should connect with each other and external streets as necessary to meet the minimum index score.

2. Connectivity Index Score Calculation
a. The connectivity index for a development is calculated by dividing its links by its nodes. Figure 30-
5.F.4.f.2, Street Connectivity Index, provides an example of how to calculate the connectivity index.
Nodes (stars) exist at street intersections and cul-de-sac heads within the development. Links
(circles) are stretches of road that connect nodes. Street stub-outs are considered as links, but
temporary dead-end streets internal to a development or alleys are not counted as links. One link
beyond every node that exists in the development and provides access to the street system outside
the development shall be included in the index calculation. In the diagram, there are 36 links (circles)
and 21 nodes (stars); therefore the connectivity index is 1.71 (36/21 = 1.71).
b. Mid-block pedestrian access, required in accordance with Section 30-5.F.5.c, Mid-Block Access, will
also be considered as a connection for the purposes of calculating the connectivity index.
3. Reduction in Minimum Index Score
The minimum connectivity index score may be reduced if the owner/developer demonstrates it is
impossible to achieve due to topographic conditions, natural features, existing road con_igurations, or
adjacent existing development patterns.
4. Pedestrian Connections Required
a. A right-of-way 20 feet wide for pedestrian/
bicycle access between a cul-de-sac head or
street turnaround and the sidewalk system
of the closest adjacent street or pedestrian
pathway (as shown in Figure 30-5.F.4.f.4,
Pedestrian Connections) shall be required
whenever the city manager determines a
proposed cul-de-sac or street turnaround:
1. Is in close proximity with signi_icant
pedestrian generators or destinations
such as schools, parks, trails,
employment centers, or similar features;
or
2. Creates an unreasonable impediment to
pedestrian circulation.
b. This pedestrian connection shall count as a
connection for the purpose of calculating
the connectivity index.
c. A pedestrian/bicycle access shall not be required between a new subdivision and a street within an
adjacent residential subdivision platted more than 12 months prior thereto.
g. External Street Connectivity
1. Purpose
These external street connectivity standards are proposed to ensure the establishment and
continuation of a logical, interconnected street network in the City.
2. General Requirements
a. The arrangement of streets in a development shall provide for the alignment and continuation of
existing or proposed streets into adjoining lands.

Figure 30-5.F.4.h: Traffic
Calming Measures
b. When required by the Technical Review Committee, street rights-of-way shall be extended to or
along adjoining property boundaries such that a roadway connection or street stub shall be provided
for development where practicable and feasible in each direction (north, south, east, and west) for
development which abuts vacant lands.
3. Review Criteria
The Technical Review Committee shall base its decision regarding the type, location, and con_iguration
of required new street connections on the following criteria:
a. The Site Plan or Subdivision Plan's consistency with subdivision access standards in Table 30-5.F.6;
b. The impact on travel distance and response time for emergency service providers resulting from
new street connections;
c. The need for and potential to disperse traf_ic and reduce congestion at intersections from new street
connections;
d. The ability to reduce travel time for residents from the inclusion of new street connections;
e. The potential of a new street connection to reduce negative impacts on air quality (by reducing
vehicles miles travelled or driving time);
f. The potential impact on existing development patterns, compatibility, or safety from new street
connections; and
g. The potential impact on natural areas or natural features from new street connections.
In no instance shall a new street connection result in a reclassi_ication of an existing street to a new
street classi_ication higher than a collector street, nor shall a new street connection be approved if it
results in a reduction in existing level of service by two categories or more for any existing street or
intersection serving the new development.
4. Noti_ication of Connected Streets
a. At all locations where streets terminate with no street connection, but a future connection is planned
or accommodated, a sign shall be installed at the location with the words "FUTURE ROAD
CONNECTION" to inform property owners.
b. The Final Plat (see Section 30-2.C.6.e, Final Plat) shall identify all stub streets and include a notation
that all street stubs are intended for connection with future streets on adjoining undeveloped
property. (Also see Section 30-6.A.4.a Public Streets and Alleys.)
h. Traf_ic Calming Measures
1. Minimal street widths, short block lengths, on-street
parking, controlled intersections, roundabouts, and other
traf_ic calming measures are encouraged on all local, and
sub-collector streets, provided they do not interfere with
emergency vehicle access.
2. In cases where residential development is organized
around a grid street network, measures to interrupt or
terminate long, linear street segments of over 800 linear
feet shall be employed, to the maximum extent practicable.
Such measures shall include, but shall not be limited to:
a. Stop signs at street intersections;
b. Round-abouts, or traf_ic circles;
c. Curvilinear street segments to slow traf_ic and interrupt
monotonous streetscapes;
d. Roadway striping to limit vehicular cartway widths or
accommodate bike lanes; and
e. Speed tables or elevated pedestrian street crossings.
3. Sidewalk bulb-outs are discouraged on streets less than 28
feet wide, but are encouraged on wider streets as a traf_ic

2. Average block length shall be 800 feet or less and no
individual block length shall exceed 1,200 linear feet.
However, the TRC may allow deviations from these block
length standards in cases where:
a. Environmental or topographic constraints exist;
b. If a site has an irregular shape;
c. If a longer block will reduce the number of railroad
grade or major stream crossings; or
d. Where longer blocks will result in less traf_ic through
residential subdivisions from adjoining businesses or
areas.
b. Block Width
To the maximum extent practicable, the width of any block
shall be suf_icient to permit at least two tiers of lots of
appropriate depth for the zoning district exclusive of any
public alleys, watercourses, or other right-of-way located
outside platted lots.
c. Mid-Block Access
In cases where a block length exceeds 800 feet, sidewalks or
multi-use paths shall be provided mid-block to connect
parallel sidewalks on the long side of the block. A mid-block
connector is not required when usable open space is within
1,500 feet of all lots in the development (See 30-5.C.3.b.2,
Usability of Dedicated Land).

an applicant or developer may request the ability to provide payment-in-lieu for all or a portion of the
required sidewalks when the following situations exist. The City Manager may approve or disapprove the
request and may require a comparable amount of on-site pedestrian or multi-purpose facilities elsewhere
on site instead of approving an in-lieu payment. Fees received in accordance with this subsection shall be
used only for the development of new sidewalks and multi-use paths.
1. The street is designated as a state highway or route subject to widening or improvement in the
foreseeable future;
2. The street is planned for improvement in accordance with the City’s transportation plan(s);

30-5.J. Large Retail Design Standards
30-5.J.1. Intent
The intent of this section is to encourage visual design interest and a pedestrian site design for large-retail
buildings. These structures shall be designed to reduce the massive scale and uniform, monolithic
appearances. Building design shall also promote a safe and comfortable pedestrian-oriented site with a
mixture of uses and sizes of structures. Careful attention to local community design issues will also ensure a
greater likelihood of reuse of the structure for subsequent tenants.
30-5.J.2. Applicability
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer

within the primary store, do not count as multiple tenants.
b. Out Parcels
Pad sites and out parcels with structures that are associated with the primary development and which are
included in the original Subdivision Plan and/ or Master Plan of the overall development. Due to the
typically smaller scale of pad sites, the City Manager may deviate from the prescribed façade treatments if
the overall design of the structure(s) on all of its publicly visible sides, remains compatible and
comparable to the principle structure.
c. Vacancy
Abandoned buildings and blighted sites cause negative visual and _iscal concerns for the community.

coordinate with the building.
5. Grounds
a. All landscaped areas as de_ined in the approved plan(s) shall be well-maintained and kept free of
trash, old building material, junk, unlicensed or inoperative vehicles, and other such material and
equipment which, by its appearance, location or use, makes it incompatible with the principle use or
other uses in the immediate neighborhood. Grass and other general ground cover shall be
maintained in a neat and orderly manner, and kept trimmed to a height of no more than eight
inches.
b. All driveway, parking, loading and outside storage areas shall be maintained in accordance with the

relocation of existing overhead utilities, all existing utility and electrical lines (30,000 volts or less and
located on the site and/or along the site's perimeter and within the public right-of-way) shall be placed
underground. In circumstances when the utility company determines that the undergrounding will be
detrimental to the overall safety and/or reliability of the circuit, this requirement shall be waived. For
multiple frontage sites that are not corner lots, the City Manager, in consultation with PWC or another
utility provider, may allow for the retention of the existing overhead lines in whole or in part, based upon
circuit reliability and safety, and/ or the frontage's length, topography, and/or visibility, or excessive cost.

30-5.L. Signage
30-5.L.1. Organiza_on of Signage Sec_on
This section includes standards addressing different types of signs, sign conditions, or sign standards. The
section also includes information addressing sign construction and maintenance. The section is organized
into the following subsections:
a. Purpose;
b. General Provisions;
c. Prohibited Signs;
d. Exempt Signs;
e. Signs Permitted Without a Sign Permit;
f. Signs Permitted With a Sign Permit;
g. Signs Permitted in Non-Residential Districts;
h. Signs Permitted in Downtown;
i. Signs Permitted by Special Use Permit;
j. Sign Construction Standards; and
k. Sign Maintenance, Repair Removal, and Disposal of Signs.
30-5.L.2. Purpose
a. The purpose of this section is to provide standards to safeguard life, public health, safety, property, and
welfare by guiding, coordinating, and regulating the type, number, placement and scale (size and height)
of signs referenced to different zoning districts, as well as the quality of material, construction, erection,
alteration, illumination, display, use, maintenance and removal of signs in the City. In addition the purpose
of this section is to:
1. Ensure that signage is suf_iciently visible to the public for which it is intended;
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 821/938
2. Provide regulatory direction and incentives to improve the quality of commercial and noncommercial
signage in the City of Fayetteville;
3. Ensure that signage re_lects and complements the character of the location where it is installed;
4. Establish standards in keeping with the state-of-the-art technology and materials;
5. Coordinate and balance the location of signage with other site features, including site lighting and
landscaping, in order to minimize con_licts and ensure adequate visibility of installed signage;
6. Enhance the aesthetic vitality of the City of Fayetteville by allowing and promoting creative sign
design;
7. Allow designated historic and character-de_ining signs to remain in place;
8. Establish clear requirements and incentives for the effective display of addresses.
b. Outdoor Advertising
It is recognized that, unlike on-premises identi_ication and business signs which are actually a part of an
enterprise, business, or activity, outdoor advertising is a separate and distinct use of properties adjoining
or near public thoroughfares. With a view to this distinction, billboards or outdoor advertising signs (also
know as off-premises signs) are regulated differently from on- premises signs. It is intended that
billboards or outdoor advertising signs be located away from residential areas and that such signs be
regulated to protect the character of the area wherein billboards or outdoor advertising signs are located,
and to conserve property values in these areas. The provisions of this section are intended to correspond
with the balance of the Ordinance.The provisions of these advertising and sign regulations are authorized
by North Carolina General Statutes Section 160A-174.
c. Authority
The provisions of these advertising and sign regulations are authorized by North Carolina General
Statutes Section 160A-174.
d. Jurisdiction
The provisions set forth in these advertising and sign regulations shall be applicable within the City limits
of the City.
(Ord. No. S2016-008, § 2, 8-22-2016)
30-5.L.3. General Provisions
a. In General
The regulations in this section specify the number, types, sizes, heights, and locations of signs which are
permitted within the City. It shall be unlawful for any person to erect, place, alter or maintain a sign in the
City except in accordance with the provisions of this section. Regulations governing the use of signs
within the jurisdiction and referenced to the various zoning districts are set forth in this section. All signs
shall be erected, altered, and maintained in accordance with the provisions of this section and, unless
exempted, only those signs as speci_ied and as regulated shall be erected within the City.
b. Determination of Sign Copy Area
1. In measuring the copy area of a sign permitted under this section the entire face of the sign containing
the sign copy shall be included. Speci_ically exempted from this provision are poles, pole covers, bases
of ground signs, and decorative elements not containing sign copy.
2. Where both sides of a double-faced sign contain lettering or other allowable display, one side only shall
be used to compute the allowable size of the sign; however, each side of a multiple-faced sign shall be
used separately to compute allowable sign size.
3. Where the sign consists of individual letters, numbers, characters, _igures or displays attached in some
manner to a building or a sign face of irregular shape, the sign copy area shall include the area of the
smallest circle, square, or rectangle that can encompass the total sign area composed of letters,
numbers, characters, _igures or displays or the irregular shaped sign face.
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 822/938
4. Where signs have appendages or additions, such as "pop-ups" or "cutouts" that extend beyond the
main sign copy area, the area of such appendages or additions shall be measured separately, but
included in the total sign copy area.
5. Any area designed for changeable copy shall also be counted as part of the total sign area.
c. Determination of Sign Height
1. The height of a sign erected within 30 feet of a street right-of-way line shall be the distance from the
grade level of the nearest edge of the street to the top of the sign or sign structure, whichever is greater.
2. The height of all signs farther than 30 feet from a street right-of-way line shall be the distance from the
grade level where the sign is erected to the top of the sign or sign structure, whichever is greater.
d. Determination of Sign Setback
In determining setback, measurement shall be made from the nearest street right-of-way line.
e. Protection of First Amendment Rights
Any sign, display, or device allowed under this section may contain, in-lieu of any other copy, any
otherwise lawful noncommercial message which does not direct attention to a business operated for
pro_it, or to a commodity or service for sale; provided that such sign complies with the size, lighting,
spacing, setback and other requirements of this article. This includes both signs requiring and not
requiring a permit.
f. Unlawful Cutting of Trees and Shrubs
No person may, for the purpose of increasing or enhancing the visibility of any sign, damage, trim, destroy
or remove any trees, shrubs, or other vegetation located:

which avoids glare or re_lection which in any way or manner interferes with traf_ic safety. Any external
source of illumination, such as spotlights or _loodlights shall be placed so that the source is not directly
visible from any adjacent residential zoning districts. All on-premises pole signs permitted in
nonresidential zoning districts, if illuminated, shall be illuminated internally.
i. Distributing Advertising Matter Generally
1. It shall be unlawful to advertise by distribution of samples or printed matter of any kind (except as
provided in Chapter 15 of the City Code pertaining to licenses) by tacking, pasting, tying or otherwise
placing or throwing the samples or printed matter on any street, lot, pole, post, tree or in or on any
mailbox or other object within the public right-of-way. Such advertisements shall be either handed to
persons or placed on their individual porches or doorways.
2. It shall be unlawful to distribute commercial advertising or matter of any kind by placing the
commercial advertising or matter in or on any motor vehicle that is parked on any street, in other
public places, or in a public or private parking lot or facility; or upon any bridge or any traf_ic control
box within the City; or to place any object for the purpose of advertising within the public right-of-way
without express permission from the City; provided, that this section shall not apply to the placing of

property address from the adjoining public right-of-way to which the property is addressed. Such
address signs must contain the street number assigned to the property, but can also designate the street
name. Address signs can be combined with the sign copy of any freestanding or attached signage and
shall not be counted toward the maximum allowed signage, provided that the address sign not contain
more than one square foot for every four linear feet of frontage for the applicable property or occupancy,
respectively. (See also Section 24-167 of the City Code of Ordinances.)
(Ord. No. S2016-008, § 3a-e, 8-22-2016)
30-5.L.4. Prohibited Signs
The following signs, components, and characteristics are expressly prohibited within all zoning districts
unless speci_ically stated otherwise in this section:
a. Simulated Public Safety, Warning, or Traf_ic Signs
Signs by their location, color, illumination, size, shape, nature, message or appearance tend to obstruct the
view of or be confused with of_icial traf_ic, safety, or warning signs, or lights or other devices erected by
governmental agencies. This prohibition includes signs having no bona _ide safety necessity, involving the
terms "CAUTION," "DANGER," "SLOW," "STOP" OR "YIELD," or which utilize geometric _igures, symbols,
lights, location or message not unlike of_icial traf_ic, safety, or warning signs, signals, or lights; provided,

any sign that is not maintained in accordance with the provisions of this article. Such removal shall be at
the expense of the owner. Signs that are not repaired or removed as required by the City Manager shall be
cause to take legal action to effectuate such repair or removal.
c. Removal of Discontinued Signs
If a nonconforming sign, other than a billboard sign, advertises a business, service, commodity,
accommodation, attraction or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being offered or
conducted, that sign and sign structure including, but not limited to, the supporting braces, anchors or
similar components shall be considered discontinued regardless of reason or intent and shall, within 120
days after such discontinuation, be removed by the owner of the property where the sign is located. This
subsection shall not be construed to alter the effect of Section 30-7.E, Nonconforming Signs, nor shall this
subsection be construed to prevent the changing of the message of a sign. This subsection shall apply to
all related signs located both on and off the premises. For conforming signs, all advertising must be
removed and a blank opaque sign face must be installed and maintained with like material within 30 days
of the closing of a business, service, commodity, accommodation, attraction or other enterprise or activity

30-2.C.1), Planned Developments (see Section 30-2.C.3), Site Plans (see Section 30-2.C.5), Subdivision Plans
(see Section 30-2.C.6), or Special Use Permits (see Section 30-2.C.7) for any development is noted below:
a. A TIA may be required if the development is expected to generate 150-299 peak traf_ic hour trips or
1,500-2,999 average daily additional external vehicle trips (i.e. new trips - no pass-by or internal capture
trips shall be used in calculating "additional external vehicle trips") based on trip generation estimates
made in accordance with the most recent editions of Trip Generation and Trip Generation Handbook,
published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE);
b. A TIA shall be required if the development is expected to generate 300 or more peak traf_ic hour trips or
3,000 average daily additional external vehicle trips (i.e. new trips - no pass-by or internal capture trips
shall be used in calculating "additional external vehicle trips") based on trip generation estimates made in
accordance with the most recent editions of Trip Generation and Trip Generation Handbook, published by
the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE);
c. As determined by the City Manager when conditions warrant.
d. In lieu of a TIA, alternative vehicular and/or pedestrian analyses may be requested by the City Manager
which include, but are not limited to, individual intersection peak hour counts, trip generation and/or trip
distribution calculations for use by City staff to determine any mitigation measures that may be required
by development sites.
e. A TIA may be waived by the City Manager when certain conditions exist for a development site. These
conditions may include development sites that are being proposed at locations where roadway
improvement projects have been constructed to accommodate these speci_ic development sites.

of North Carolina; and
e. Steep slopes (slopes greater than 25 percent).
2. Amount to be Preserved
All areas occupied by features comprising a primary conservation area shall be set aside and reserved
for conservation purposes in accordance with the following standards:
a. Primary Conservation Area is Less than 50 Percent of Site Area
In cases where the geographic area occupied by all features comprising the primary conservation
area is less than 50 percent of the total subdivision site area, then all lands comprising the primary
conservation area shall be set aside.
b. Primary Conservation Area Exceeds 50 Percent of Site Area
1. In the event the geographic area of all features identi_ied and prioritized as the primary
conservation area results in a primary conservation area exceeding the 50 percent set-aside
requirement (for example, conservation of the _irst type of prioritized features constitute 47
percent of a site, and the next prioritized feature consists of _ive percent, the applicant may
identify which portions of the feature exceeding the 50 percent set-aside will be designated for
conversion to development area). To the maximum extent practicable, priority for retention shall
be given to the highest quality portion of the features to be conserved.
2. Development on lands made available for conversion to development area shall be in accordance
with the standards in this Ordinance.

accordance with the standards in Section 30-5.C.3.b,
Calculation of Open Space Set-Asides, and shall be
designated for inclusion within the conservation area.
d. Primary and Secondary Conservation Areas Exceed 50
Percent of Site Area
In the event the area occupied by the primary
conservation area and the geographic area of all
features identi_ied and prioritized as the secondary
conservation area results in a combined conservation
area exceeding the 50 percent set-aside requirement,
the applicant may identify which portions of the
secondary conservation feature(s) will be designated
for conversion to development area. To the maximum
extent practicable, priority for retention shall be given

The owner of a non-conforming billboard sign with static face(s) may apply to the Development Services
Department for the purpose of approving an application for transfer. Transfer under this section would allow
the owner of a sign to voluntarily and permanently remove a static billboard face in the City in exchange for
the one-time opportunity to change or replace a billboard or billboard face on a non-conforming billboard
within the City providing the face(s) remain static. The billboard owner may request enlarging the copy area
or increasing the height of the billboard. However, no copy area may be increased more than 135 percent of
the current copy area nor shall any copy area be greater than 400 square feet. In addition, no billboard height
may be increased above 30 feet above road grade adjacent to the billboard. Billboards taller than 30 feet may

Amortization. See also the Code Comparative Table.
30-7.E.8. Transfer during Amor_za_on – Digital Billboards
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the owner of a static billboard sign may apply to the
Development Services Department for a permit to convert a static billboard to a digital billboard under the
following conditions. The purpose of this conversion is to enable the maintenance and upgrading of certain
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 871/938
billboards to digital format in return for the overall reduction in nonconforming billboards in a manner that
improves community gateways, overall appearance, and compatibility with adjacent uses.
a. No digitally converted billboard shall be of a height greater than 30 feet above the road grade adjacent to
the billboard.
b. No digital face area may be increased more than 135 percent of the average copy area of the faces being
removed, and no digital billboard face shall be greater than 400 square feet of copy area after said
conversion.
c. Digitally converted billboards shall be a minimum of 5,000 linear feet apart from any other digital
billboard on the same road facing in the same direction of travel.

location of the existing billboard and no closer to the street right-of-way than the existing billboard.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no digitally converted billboard shall be placed within any street right-ofway
or prescribed line of sight.
e. No moving, rotating, _luttering, blinking, _lashing or animation messages shall be allowed on a digitally
converted billboard.

surrounding ambient light conditions. Each digital billboard shall be monitored by a light sensing device
at all times and the display brightness shall be automatically adjusted to the 0.3 standard as ambient light
levels change, i.e. the brightness will be decreased during night time hours. All illumination devices shall
be effectively shielded to prevent direct beams of light from being aimed at any portion of a street or at
any residential use.
i. The conversion from a static billboard to a digital billboard requires the removal of three static billboard
faces within the City for each digital billboard face installed within the City. Each request shall be
evaluated by staff for the following:
1. The transfer promotes the appearance of either a gateway into or property located in the City;
2. The proposed improvements to or replacement of an existing billboard _it within the character of the
surrounding properties or existing structures, will not interfere with the movement of traf_ic, and do
not otherwise hinder the safety of those that use that road; and
3. The transfer does not con_lict with the stated purpose of this section.
j. As part of the digital conversion permitting process, the owner of a static billboard sign must identify in
its application the following:
1. The location of the static billboard face to be replaced,
2. The size of the static face to be replaced,
3. The size of the digital billboard face being installed,
4. Any minor changes in pole location (pursuant to subparagraph "d" above), and
5. The location of the three other static billboard faces being removed.

online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 872/938
30-7.F.1. Interior and Exterior Remodeling of Buildings or Structures
If a Building Permit is required for interior or exterior remodeling of the building or structure, the
remodeling or redevelopment shall require correction of existing on-site nonconforming off-street parking,
landscaping, perimeter buffer, screening, and open space standards in accordance with this section.
a. Off-Street Parking, Landscaping, Perimeter Buffers, Open Space, and Screening
1. 25 Percent or Less of Structure Value
Remodeling in any continuous 12-month period that costs 25 percent or less of the current fair market
or assessed value of the structure (at the option of the applicant) shall not require any correction to
nonconforming site aspects.
2. More Than 25 Percent but Less Than 75 Percent of Structure Value
Remodeling in any continuous 12-month period that costs more than 25 percent but less than 75
percent of the current fair market or assessed value of the structure (at the option of the applicant)
shall require that a corresponding percentage of the off-street parking, landscaping, perimeter buffer,
screening, and open space standards of this Ordinance be installed or upgraded on the site, until the
site achieves 100 percent compliance. (For example, if a site has 20 of 30 required parking spaces (66
percent of the required parking) and the cost of the remodeling is 30 percent of the value of the
building, then 30 percent of the total amount of required off-street parking shall be provided, or nine
additional spaces, bringing the parking to 96 percent of the total amount of off-street parking required
under this Article).
3. 75 Percent or More of Structure Value
Remodeling projects that cost 75 percent or more of the current fair market value of the structure shall
require 100 percent compliance with the off-street parking, landscaping, perimeter buffer, screening,
and open space standards of this Article.
4. Five or Fewer Additional Parking Spaces
When _ive or fewer additional off-street parking spaces are required under this subsection as a result
of a remodeling project, such additional off-street parking is not required to be installed.
b. Physically Constrained Properties- Comply to Maximum Extent Practicable
1. Lands that are physically constrained (due to limited size, topography, or other environmental
considerations) from complying with these provisions shall comply to the maximum extent
practicable, as determined by the City Manager. In determining the priorities for remediation, the
entire site, its context and its operational characteristics will be considered, with the _irst objective
being public safety and buffering issues, followed by achieving a balance regarding parking,
landscaping or other site nonconformities.
2. For purposes of determining when a correction is required, the cost of the remodeling shall be as
shown on the approved Building Permit application. Fair market value shall be based on a market
appraisal performed by a certi_ied appraiser, at the applicant's expense. Assessed value shall be based
upon Cumberland County Tax Assessor information.
(Ord. No. S2012-017, §§ 10.1, 10.2, 9-10-2012; Ord. No. S2013-002, §§ 1a, 1b, 2-11-2013; Ord. No. S2013-015, §

gross square footage of the existing structure (measured at the beginning of the _ive-year period),
require that a corresponding percentage of the off-street parking, landscaping, perimeter buffer,
screening, and open space standards of this Ordinance be installed or upgraded on the site, until the
site achieves 100 percent compliance. (For example, if the addition is 25 percent of the area of the
existing structure and the site contains only 50 percent of the required landscaping, 25 percent of the
required landscaping for the entire site must be provided, thereby bringing the landscaping on the site
to 75 percent of the total required.) Existing landscaping on the site shall be retained or replaced but
shall not count toward the required percentage of new landscaping.
2. Expansion of Greater Than 50 Percent of Gross Square Footage Over Five Years
Expansions over any continuous _ive-year period, which result in a greater than 50 percent increase of
the gross square footage of the existing structure (measured at the beginning of the _ive-year period),
require the entire property to meet all of the off-street parking, landscaping, perimeter buffer,
screening, and open space standards of this Article.
b. Physically Constrained Properties- Comply to Maximum Extent Practicable
Lands that are physically constrained (due to limited size, topography, or other environmental
considerations) from complying with these provisions shall comply consistent with Section 30-7.F.1(b)(1)
above.
c. Addition of Outdoor Storage Area Only
When only outdoor operations/storage/display areas are being added or increased on a site, the
percentage increase in outdoor operations area shall require a corresponding percentage increase in
perimeter buffers and screening. Perimeter buffer and screening augmentation shall be located so as to
achieve the performance objectives in Section 30-5.B, Landscaping and Tree Protection, with priority
given to screening the impacts of outdoor operations.
(Ord. No. S2012-017, § 10.3, 9-10-2012; Ord. No. S2013-002, § 1c, 2-11-2013; Ord. No. S2013-015, § 7.3, 7-22-
2013)
30-7.F.3. Changes in Use
Any change in use shall require the entire property to meet all of the off-street parking, landscaping,
perimeter buffer, screening, and open space standards of this Article.
(Ord. No. S2012-017, § 10.4, 10.2, 9-10-2012; Ord. No. S2013-002, § 1d, 2-11-2013; Ord. No. S2013-015, § 7.4, 7-

Planning Association.
30-9.B. Rules of Management
30-9.B.1. Measurements, Computa_ons, and Excep_ons
a. Purpose
The purpose of this section is to clarify the rules of measurement and exemptions that apply to all
principal and accessory uses allowed in this Ordinance. These standards may be modi_ied by other
applicable sections of this Ordinance.
b. Distance Measurements, Generally
Unless otherwise expressly stated, distances speci_ied in this Ordinance are to be measured as the length
of an imaginary straight line joining those points.
c. Lot Measurements
1. Lot Area
The area of a lot includes the total horizontal surface area within the lot's boundaries.
2. Lot Width
Lot width is the distance between the side lot lines measured along the front building setback line. In
cases where a structure is "condominiumized", or the interior _loor area of a structure is owned by
different owners, the zoning district lot width requirement the shall apply only to the parent tract or
development site, not the individual ownership units.
d. Gross Residential Density Measurement
1. Gross residential density (the number of dwelling units per gross acre of land) is determined by
dividing the number of dwelling units by the total area of land within the boundaries of a parcel of
land, including existing streets, dedicated right-of-way, and open space set-asides, except as otherwise
provided in this Article.
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 881/938
When the different uses on a large parcel are in separate areas, as in a PUD Planned Development and a
higher density is allowed for "mixed use" in that district, the higher density rate may be used but only
the acreage attributable to the residential use shall be used to calculate gross residential density. When
the different uses are functionally integrated, either horizontally or vertically, both the higher rate and
the entire acreage may be used to calculate gross residential density.
2. In cases where a site's acreage allows a gross density that exceeds a whole number by 0.6 or more, the
total density may be rounded upwards to the next whole number, thus allowing an additional dwelling
unit to be located on a site.
e. Lot Coverage
Lot coverage (the portion of a site covered by principal and accessory buildings) is determined by
calculating the percentage of the total area of land within the boundaries of a lot covered by the sum of
the surface areas covered by each principal and accessory building on the lot, measured from their
exterior walls at ground level.
Figure 30-9.B.1.e: Lot Coverage
f. Setbacks and Yards
1. Measurements
Setbacks refer to the unobstructed, unoccupied open area between the furthermost projection of a
structure and the property line of the lot on which the structure is located. Setbacks shall be
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 882/938
unobstructed from the ground to the sky except as otherwise expressly allowed in Subsection 30-
9.B.1.f.2, Allowable Encroachments into Required Setbacks.
2. Permitted Encroachments into Required Setbacks
a. The following features may be located within required setbacks to the extent indicated (see Figure
30-9.B.1.f.2, Allowable Encroachments):
1. Sidewalks and landscaping (including retaining walls);
2. Accessory uses and structures as allowed in Section 30-4.D, Accessory Uses and Structures; and
3. Fences and walls as allowed in Section 30-5.D, Fences and Walls.
Figure 30-9.B.1.f.2: Allowable Encroachments
b. Appurtenances are permitted to encroach into a required front or rear yard setback up to six feet
and within side yards up to _ive feet from the property line provided a minimum of ten feet between
buildings is maintained. Such appurtenances include, but are lot limited to, uncovered ramps for the
handicapped, porch stoops, steps, eaves, gutters, sills, belt courses, buttresses, cornices, ornamental
features, canopies, and marquees.
3. Yards Required for Buildings
A yard or other open area required about a building shall not be included as part of a yard or other
open space for another building.
4. Front Yard Setback
a. Front Yard Setback and Streets
The yard fronting a street towards which the front of the primary structure faces shall be
considered to be a front yard and shall meet the minimum front yard setback. If it is not clear which
street a structure faces, consideration shall be given to which side of a structure includes the
primary entrance and (for existing structures) which street provides the structure's street address
(see Figure 30-9.B.1.f.4, Yard/Setback Types).
b. Measurement
The front yard setback shall extend the full width of the lot and shall be measured from the street
right-of-way line.
Figure 30-9.B.1.f.4: Yard/Setback Types
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 883/938
c. Double Frontage Lot
A double frontage lot shall provide a front yard setback on both streets. The remaining yards shall
meet the side yard setback requirements.
d. Corner Lot
A corner lot shall provide a front yard setback on the street towards which the front of the principal
structure faces. The remaining yards shall meet the corner side yard setback requirements.
e. Cul-de-Sac or Curved-Street Lot
For a cul-de-sac lot or a lot abutting a curved street, the front yard setback shall follow the curve of
the front property line.
5. Side Yard Setback
The side yard setback shall extend from the required front yard setback line to the required rear yard
setback line and shall be measured from the side lot line. If no front or rear yard setback is required,
the setback shall extend the full depth of the lot.
6. Rear Yard Setback
The rear yard setback shall extend the full width of the lot and shall be measured from the rear lot line.
7. Corner Side Setback
The corner side setback on a corner lot shall be measured from the edge of the right-of-way of the
street towards which the front of the primary structure does not face.
g. Building Height
1. Building height shall be the vertical distance measured from the lowest _inished grade (following
grading, excavation, or other land-disturbing activity) at the front corner of a building to the highest
point of the roof surface of a _lat roof, to the deck line of a mansard roof, or to the mean height level
between eaves and the ridge of a gable, hip, cone, gambrel, or shed roof, as depicted in Figure 30-
9.B.1.f.8, Building Height Measurement.
Figure 30-9.B.1.g: Building Height Measurement
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 884/938
2. In cases where a lot is smaller than 40,000 square feet, and has signi_icant topographical variation, the
City Manager may measure height at the rear corner of a building upon a _inding that such adjustment
is necessary to maintain consistency with the goals of the comprehensive plan and the intent of this
Ordinance.
h. Other Height Measures and Exceptions
1. The maximum height of structures may be reduced pursuant to Section 30-5.K, Transitional Standards.
2. Height limits for telecommunications towers and radio and television transmission towers are
established by Section 30-4.C.3.i, Telecommunications Towers.
3. Height limits shall not apply to chimneys, church spires, belfries, cupolas, domes, _lag poles,
monuments, water towers, rooftop dish antennas, or similar appurtenances, provided:
a. The appurtenance does not interfere with Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 77, Objects Affecting
Navigable Airspace;
b. The appurtenance does not extend more than 25 feet above the maximum permitted building
height, except as allowed herein;
c. The appurtenance does not exceed a maximum height of 200 feet above grade;
d. The appurtenance is not constructed for the purpose of providing additional _loor area in the
building; and
e. The appurtenance complies with the screening requirements for mechanical equipment and
appurtenances in Article 30-5.B.1.g: Screening.
4. Other Height Measures and Exceptions
Where the measure of other vertical elements such as light poles has not been de_ined, the default shall
be from the ground to the top of that element unless there are signi_icant topographic changes
immediately around the proposed location (within approximately 30’) in which case the height may be
reduced by as much as one-half the difference in elevations. The intent is to avoid such measures as
from the peak of a narrow berm or an arti_icially created peak relative to the surrounding area.
(Ord. No. S2012-025, § 6, 11-13-2012; Ord. No. S2014-015, § 3, 8-11-2014)
30-9.B.2. Computa_on of Required Off-Street Parking Spaces
a. Fractions
When computation of the number of required parking spaces results in a fraction, the result shall be
3/20/2020 - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1 885/938
rounded upward to the next highest whole number.
b. Different Use Areas
Except as otherwise provided for in this section, parking shall be calculated separately for each area in a
building or on a site that is devoted to a different use, including all accessory uses.
c. Combinations of Uses
If the City Manager determines that a proposed use represents a combination of uses listed in Table 30-
5.A.4.B, Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards, the minimum and maximum parking space standards
shall be the sum of those that would apply if the uses were developed separately, unless the City Manager
determines that a lower standard would be adequate because of differences in peak operating hours.
d. Parking Based on Seating
Where the minimum number of off-street parking spaces required in Table 30-5.A.4.B, Minimum Off-
Street Parking Standards, is based on the number of seats, all computations shall be based on the design
capacity of the areas used for seating.
e. Parking Based on Floor Area
Except as otherwise provided in this section, where the minimum number of off-street parking spaces
required in Table 30-5.A.4.B, Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards, is based on square feet of gross _loor
area.
f. Parking Based on Employees or Students
Except as otherwise provided in this section, where the minimum number of off-street parking spaces
required in Table 30-5.A.4.B, Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards, is based on the number of
employees or students, all computations shall be based on the largest number of persons working on any
single shift (for employees) or maximum enrollment (for students), whichever is applicable.
g. On-Street Parking
Except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, on-street parking on public or private streets, driveways,
or drives shall not be used to satisfy the off-street parking standards of this section.
h. Driveways Used to Satisfy Requirements
For single-family attached and detached dwellings and two- to four-family dwellings, driveways may be
used to satisfy minimum off-street parking standards, provided suf_icient space is available to satisfy the
standards of Table 30-5.A.4.B, Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards, and Section 30-5.A.5, Parking
Standards for Single-Family Development.
i. Determination by City Manager
The minimum number of parking spaces required for uses not speci_ically listed in Table 30-5.A.4.B,
Minimum Off-Street Parking Standards, shall be determined by the City Manager based on the standards
for the closest comparable use or by reference to standard parking resources published by the National
Parking Association or the American Planning Association. Alternatively, the City Manager may require
the applicant to submit a parking demand study that justi_ies estimates of parking demand based on the
recommendations of the Institute of Traf_ic Engineers (ITE), and includes relevant data collected from
uses or combinations of uses that are the same or comparable to the proposed use in terms of density,
scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location.
30-9.B.3. Computa_on of Separa_on Requirements
When not otherwise speci_ied in the standards of this ordinance, a required separation between uses shall be
calculated by measuring from the nearest wall of the proposed use (or corner of the lot if no building is
established) to the nearest wall of the other use.
