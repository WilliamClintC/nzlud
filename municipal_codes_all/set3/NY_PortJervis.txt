Special Assessments
§ C5-1. Common Council to provide manner of paying expense of
improvements.
§ C5-2. District of assessment.
After the Common Council shall have declared its intention to make any
improvement, except as to sewers, before ordering the same done, the
Common Council shall establish a district of assessment, which shall
contain all the property which in the judgment of the Common Council is
likely to be benefited by such improvement, and may at any time enlarge
said district, and cause notices served upon all persons within such
enlargement as provided by § C5-3 of this Charter.
§ C5-3. Notice of proposed improvement.
If a district of assessment has been established, then upon the passage
of a resolution of the Common Council declaring its intention to make
an improvement, the expense of which is payable wholly or partly by
assessment, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall prepare and sign a written notice
of the proposed improvement, specifying therein the time during which
any person interested may file his objection thereto with the City Clerk-
Treasurer, which time shall not expire before the next regular meeting
of the Common Council, and that in case no objection is filed within the
time specified, all persons interested will be deemed to have acquiesced in
the proposed improvement. Such notice shall either be published at least
once in the official newspaper of the city at least ten (10) days before the
expiration of the time for objection thereto, or shall be served upon each
such owner of property within the district of assessment fixed for such
improvement, as follows: by delivering to him personally a copy thereof or
A. The Common Council may by resolution authorize or direct the making
of any improvement which it is empowered or required by law to make.
In any resolution authorizing or directing the making of any
improvement, or in any subsequent resolution, the Common Council
shall have power to provide that the whole of the expense of any such
improvement shall be borne by the city at large; or, subject to the
limitations provided by law, that the whole or a part or portion of such
expense (which portion shall be specified in such resolution) shall be
assessed upon the property deemed benefited.
B. No expenditures for any improvement in said city, the expense of which
is to be defrayed wholly or partially by assessment upon the property
deemed benefited, shall be incurred, unless the Common Council shall
first by resolution declare its intention to make such local improvement
and give notice thereof as provided by § C5-3 of this Charter, which
declaration shall be made without preliminary petition for or consent to
such improvement.
§ C5-1 CHARTER § C5-3
C:37
by leaving a copy thereof at his residence in said city with some member
of his family or some person of suitable age and discretion, or if he resides
elsewhere, by service as above described on his agent or other person
having the property in charge, or by depositing it in the post office properly
enclosed and the postage prepaid thereon, directed to such owner at his
last known place of residence. If there be two (2) or more owners of any
one piece of property, service on any one (1) of them shall be sufficient
notice to the owners of such piece of property. Affidavits of the service
and publication of such notice shall be filed in the office of the City Clerk-
Treasurer and the affidavits or record thereof, or a certified copy of either,
shall in all courts and places, actions or proceedings be prima facie proof of
the facts stated therein.
§ C5-4. Objections to improvements and decision thereon.
Objections to such improvement must be made in writing and filed with
the City Clerk-Treasurer within the time specified in such notice, and the
Common Council may, at any regular meeting within two (2) months after
the expiration of such ten (10) days, subject to the Mayor's veto as in other
cases, order the improvement to be made.
§ C5-5. Assessment of costs.
Upon the completion of such improvement, the Common Council shall
assess so much of the portion of such expenses as are not payable by
the city at large upon the property lying within the district of assessment
established for such improvements, if one has been established, and if not,
then in a proportion equal to the ratio of the frontage to the total frontage
affected by such improvement. Except as herein otherwise provided, the
cost or expense of any local improvement shall be deemed to include the
entire expense thereof, including inspection.
§ C5-6. Assessment roll for special assessments.
The City Clerk-Treasurer or City Assessor, whichever shall be designated
by the Common Council, shall make out an assessment roll and a duplicate
thereof, both of which shall be deemed originals, and set the amount of the
tax assessed opposite the name of the person, corporation, association or
property assessed, and shall leave the said rolls at the office of the City
Clerk-Treasurer, and thereupon give public notice in the official newspaper,
once in each week for two (2) successive weeks, and by posting a copy of
said notice in two (2) public places in said city, that such assessment rolls
have been prepared and will remain at the office of the City Clerk-Treasurer
for the term of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, during which
time any person interested may examine said rolls, and at the expiration of
fifteen (15) days, and on the day and hour and at the place to be specified
in such notice, a quorum of the Common Council will attend and hear any
objections to said assessment and proceed to confirm the same. At the time
and place named in said notice, or at any other time or place to which the
Common Council may from time to time adjourn said hearing, any person
§ C5-3 PORT JERVIS CODE § C5-6
C:38
interested may appear before the Common Council and apply to have said
special assessment roll altered or corrected as he may deem just. After
hearing all such applications, the Common Council may proceed to make
such alterations and corrections in said special assessment roll as it may
deem just, and when completed, shall by resolution confirm the same, and
shall thereupon sign said roll and file it with the City Clerk-Treasurer. The
said assessment shall thereupon be and become final and conclusive upon
all parties interested.
§ C5-7. Assessment payable in installments.
The Common Council may, at the time of declaring its intention to make
such improvement, as provided in § C5-1B of this Charter, or at the time
of the confirmation of the said assessment, as hereinbefore provided,
determine by resolution that the said assessment may be paid either in
five (5) equal installments or in such annual installments as would be
equivalent to the annual payments of principal and interest made by the
city upon any indebtedness which the city has incurred for the purpose
of financing the amount of the cost of such improvement assessed against
the land deemed benefited, and the amortization period of such amount
shall continue for the same length of time as the amortization period on
the city's indebtedness. If the Common Council shall determine to permit
the payment of said assessment in installments, it may provide either for
the payment of the first installment according to the provisions of § C5-8
following or that the same shall be collected at the time of the collection
of the next city tax thereafter, and the remaining annual installments at
the time of the collection of city taxes; and the City Clerk-Treasurer shall
insert in the assessment rolls for city taxes for such years the amounts
of such installments as they become due in each of such years, together
with the amount of such installments in arrears, if any, and shall collect
the same, with the interest due thereon, at the same time and in the
same manner as provided for the collection of city taxes, and the warrant
attached to such roll shall provide for the collection of such installment
or installments. Whenever payment of such assessment is permitted to be
made under the five-equal-annual-installment plan, as herein provided, each
installment, except the first, shall bear interest at the rate of not less than
six per centum (6%), to be estimated from the day following the expiration
of the forty (40) days allowed in the collection of said first installment, such
interest to be in addition to the fee, percentage or interest provided for
in § C6-17 of this Charter, provided, however, that the owner or owners
of any parcel of land or real estate, franchises, right-of-way, easement or
other property affected by said assessment may pay any or all installments
remaining unpaid, with accrued interest, fee or percentage, at any time;
and, if any such installments, including the first, shall not be paid within
the period of forty (40) days as provided in § C6-17 of this Charter, the
remaining installments of the amount assessed against said parcel of land,
real estate, franchise, easement, right-of-way or other property, together
with any accrued interest, fee or percentage, shall immediately become due
and payable and may be collected in the same manner as is provided in this
Charter for the collection of county or city taxes by sale.
§ C5-6 CHARTER § C5-8
C:39
§ C5-8. Collection of local assessments.
The Common Council shall, provided that it determines that the whole
of said assessment or the first installment thereof shall be immediately
collected, cause the proper warrant to be attached to one (1) of said
assessment rolls, and to the other a copy of such warrant. Said warrants
shall be signed by the Mayor, or a majority of the members of the Common
Council, and delivered to the City Clerk-Treasurer. Whenever the
assessment roll and the warrant for its collection for any improvement shall
be left with the City Clerk-Treasurer, he shall, as Collector of Taxes, receive
the amount of the assessment thereon, or the amount of the installment
if such assessment be collectible in installments, for the same time, and
with the same fees as directed herein for the collection of city taxes, and
shall give notice to that effect immediately upon receipt of said assessment
roll, by publication thereof in the official newspaper of the city, in the same
manner and for the same time as provided herein for the collection of city
taxes. If any such assessment or installment, as the case may be, shall
remain unpaid at the expiration of six (6) months from the time of the
delivery of said assessment roll and warrant to the City Clerk-Treasurer,
the City Clerk-Treasurer, as Collector of Taxes, shall make a return of his
warrant to the Common Council, which shall proceed in the same manner
directed in this Charter for the collection of county or city taxes by sale. The
whole amount of any such assessment shall be a lien upon the lands, real
estate, franchise, easements and rights-of-way so assessed from the day of
the confirmation of the same by the Common Council. The Common Council
may, in its discretion, sue for and recover, in a civil action, of the owner any
sum which shall remain unpaid after the expiration of six (6) months from
the date of the attachment of the warrant to the assessment roll.
§ C5-9. Application of proceeds.
The proceeds from the collection of the installments of any assessment shall
constitute a fund for the purpose of paying the expense of the improvement
for which the assessment was levied and the portion of such obligations
which shall have been applied to the financing of the share of the expense
of such improvement which was assessed upon the property benefited.
§ C5-10. Opening, altering or extending streets.42
Whenever the Common Council shall intend to lay out, alter, widen, extend,
contract or discontinue any street, lane, alley, highway or public grounds
in said city, and the lands of any person or corporation, or any right or
easement therein, will be necessary for that purpose; and whenever the
Common Council shall intend to acquire lands, rights or easements therein
for any other purpose mentioned in this Charter, it shall cause the same to
be surveyed and monuments placed showing the line thereof, and a map
of the same to be made, showing the location and depth, if underground,
of all utility installations, which shall be filed in the City Clerk-Treasurer's

office, and a copy thereof to be filed in the County Clerk's office, showing
upon such map the lots, tracts and parcels of land and rights or easements
therein which are deemed necessary to be taken, and the commencement,
course and termination of the street, lane, alley, highway or park proposed
to be laid out, widened, extended or altered, or other work or improvement
proposed to be made in or through the land so to be taken. And for that
purpose the Common Council and those acting by its direction shall have
power to enter upon any grounds in said city. The Common Council shall
then declare, by resolution, its intention to take and appropriate the said
property for the proposed improvement, and thereafter it may purchase
the land or right or easement therein deemed necessary of the owner
or owners thereof, and make him or them such compensation as it shall
judge reasonable, upon receiving from such owner or owners a conveyance
thereof to the city. In case the Common Council is unable to agree with the
owner or owners for the purchase of any real estate or lands or right or
easement therein required for the purpose aforesaid, it shall acquire the
same by condemnation proceedings under the provisions of the Eminent
Domain Procedure Law of this state.
§ C5-11. Assessment of benefits.
After such damages shall have been ascertained and determined, said
Common Council shall declare a district of assessment therefor, and shall
then direct the commissioners making the award to assess the amount
awarded for damages, with the commissioners' fees, specifying the
aggregate amount of the same, upon the property within such district of
assessment. The commissioners shall proceed to assess such amount upon
the property benefited by such improvement in a just and equitable manner
as near as may be in proportion to the benefits received; such assessment
shall be made in the same manner as other local assessments, except that
such commissioners shall direct such part of said expenses to be assessed
upon the city, and such part locally, as they shall deem just; the powers and
duties of the commissioners shall be the same as those of assessors. When
the assessment roll shall be filed, the same proceedings shall thereupon be
had, and the Common Council shall possess the same powers in reference
thereto and proceed in the same manner as hereinbefore provided with
reference to other assessments. When there are infants or other
incompetent persons, owners whose property is affected by any such
improvement, the County or Supreme Court, or a Judge or Justice thereof,
may, on application, in behalf of such infants or incompetent persons
appoint guardians ad litem to protect their interests and prosecute appeals.
§ C5-12. Payment of compensation.
Immediately after the final determination of all proceedings in which any
award shall have been made, the Common Council shall cause to be paid
or tendered to the respective owners the amount awarded to each,
respectively, less any sum which shall have been assessed against them for
any benefits on account of such improvement. In case any such owner shall
refuse the same, or be unknown, or nonresident of the city, or for any reason
§ C5-10 CHARTER § C5-12
C:41
be incapacitated from receiving the amount, or the right thereto be disputed
or doubtful, the Common Council may make payment of the portion to the
Commissioner of Finance of the County of Orange and file a statement of
facts and circumstances in each case, and a transcript of the report of the
commissioners relating to the ascertainment of the amount so paid in, with
the Clerk of Orange County. Upon such payment or tender, or payment's to
the Commissioner of Finance being fully made, the fee of the land shall be
vested in the city.
§ C5-13. Acquisition of privileges to dispose of stagnant or surface
water.43
The Common Council shall have the power to enter upon any lands or
grounds in the city and appropriate such property for the purpose of
conveying off any stagnant or surface water within or throughout the city,
and thereafter may purchase from the owner or owners thereof the land
or right or easement, whenever deemed necessary, and make him or them
such compensation as it shall deem reasonable and just, upon receiving
from such owner or owners a conveyance thereof to the city. In case the
said Common Council is unable to agree with the owner or owners for
the purchase of any real estate or land or right or easement required
therein for the purpose aforesaid, it shall acquire the same by condemnation
proceedings under the provisions of the Eminent Domain Procedure Law
of the state, proceeding in the same manner as obtaining lands for street
purposes elsewhere specified in this Charter.
§ C5-14. Construction and repair of sidewalks, curbstones and
gutters.
It shall be the duty of the owners and occupants of lands fronting on or
adjoining any of the streets or avenues in said city to construct and keep
in repair the sidewalks, curbs and gutters in front of their respective lots,
in such manner, at such times and of such material as the Common Council
may, by a resolution, ordinance or local law for that purpose, direct.44
Whenever the Common Council shall deem it necessary that any sidewalk,
curbstone or gutter be made, constructed, reset, relaid or repaired, it shall
prescribe, by resolution, ordinance or local law, the width and length of the
sidewalk, the material to be used, the form and manner of the construction
of the sidewalk, curbstone or gutter and the time within which the work
shall be done. Such improvements shall conform to the grade established,
or to be established before which improvements are made. The Common
Council shall cause to be served, at least twenty (20) days before the
expiration of the time so specified for such work to be done, upon the
owners or occupants of the land adjoining such sidewalk, curbstone or
gutter so to be improved as aforesaid, a copy of such resolution, ordinance
or local law, with a notice that if the same is not done within the specified
time by the owner or occupant of the adjoining land, it will be ordered done

by the said Common Council, and the cost thereof charged as hereinafter
provided. Such notice shall be served upon such owner or occupant by
delivering a copy thereof to him personally, or by leaving the same in his
absence with some person of suitable age and discretion residing with him,
if he be a resident of the city, or otherwise on his agent or other person
having charge of the property, or by depositing the same in the post office,
properly enclosed and the postage prepaid thereon, and directed to such
owner at his last known place of residence; in case such owner or his
place of residence is unknown and there be no resident agent or occupant
to the knowledge of the Common Council, such service may be made by
affixing a copy of such local law, ordinance or resolution and notice upon a
conspicuous part of the premises. The Common Council shall also, in case
service of such notice shall be otherwise than personal, cause a copy of such
resolution, ordinance or local law to be published at least once in the official
newspaper of said city at least fifteen (15) days before the expiration of the
time specified for such work to be done. If there be two (2) or more owners
of any one piece of property, service upon one (1) of them shall be sufficient.
Affidavits of the publication and service of such resolutions, ordinances or
local laws shall be filed and recorded, in the office of the Clerk-Treasurer
of said city, and the affidavits or the records thereof, or a certified copy of
either, shall in all courts and places, actions and proceedings be prima facie
evidence of the facts therein stated. In case any such improvement, act or
thing so required shall not be made, done or completed as required within
the time specified, the Common Council shall have power to make, do or
complete the same, and having done so, shall, without giving an further
or other notice, upon affidavit of the Director of Public Works, showing
the actual expense thereof, which affidavit shall be made and filed with
the City Clerk-Treasurer, proceed to assess upon each parcel or lot of land
the expense of the sidewalk, curbstone or gutter immediately adjoining
it, which assessment shall be final and conclusive upon all persons and
parties interested in said real estate or affected thereby, and the amount so
assessed, together with interest thereon, as herein stated, shall be a lien
on the lands and premises against which such assessment has been made.
Thereupon the Common Council shall cause to be sent to the owner of said
property, if his address be known, an itemized statement of the expense
of such improvement, and if such expense is not paid to the City Clerk-
Treasurer within thirty (30) days, the amount thereof, with interest at the
rate of twelve per centum (12%) per annum from the time of sending such
statement, shall be added to the amount assessed against such land for
the next general city tax, and the whole amount of such assessment and
interest shall be collected in the same manner and with the next general
city tax. If any such assessment shall remain unpaid at the expiration of six
(6) months from the time of delivery of said assessment roll and warrant
to the City Clerk-Treasurer, the Common Council may proceed in the same
manner directed in this Charter for the collection of county or city taxes by
sale. The Common Council may also, in its discretion, sue for and recover in
a civil action of the owner any sum which the city may have paid in making
such improvement. The gutters in those portions of streets paved shall be
kept in repair at the expense of the city. Whenever the grade of any sidewalk
§ C5-14 CHARTER § C5-14
C:43
has been established by said city and recorded, and has been conformed to
by the owner of such property, any change of grade thereafter made by the
city shall be made at the expense of the city.
§ C5-15. Taxes and assessments under this Article; lien of.
Every tax and assessment imposed under any of the provisions of this
Article shall be a lien upon all real estate against which the same shall be
assessed, from and after the filing of such assessment roll. No clerical or
immaterial error shall invalidate said assessment roll or the assessments
therein. In case any tax or assessment shall be void or shall have failed
for want of jurisdiction and for any irregularity in the levying or assessing
thereof under this title, the Common Council shall have power, and it shall
be its duty, to cause the same to be reassessed in a proper manner; if any
person shall have paid on a former assessment the same shall be credited;
or in case the payment exceed the amount assessed, the surplus shall be
refunded. In case the amount assessed for any improvement shall not be
sufficient to defray the expenses of such improvement, the Common Council
shall cause the amount of the deficiency to be assessed as hereinbefore
provided.

County of Orange and sell the same. Such levy and sale and the disposition
of the proceeds thereof shall be made in accordance with the provisions of
the Real Property Tax Law of the State of New York.
§ C6-8. Payment of unpaid taxes.
If any such taxes shall remain unpaid at the expiration of six (6) months
after the same shall have become a lien, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall
report the amount of such unpaid taxes to the Common Council as provided
in § C6-19, and the Common Council shall cause the full amount thereof,
exclusive of interest and penalties, to be paid to the Commissioner of
Finance of Orange County. The full amount of such unpaid taxes reported
to the Common Council and paid to the County Commissioner of Finance as
herein provided shall be included in the next ensuing levy of county taxes
§ C6-5 CHARTER § C6-8
C:47
upon the taxable property within the city, and any tax anticipation notes
issued in anticipation of the collection of such taxes shall be paid from the
first moneys collected pursuant to such levy.
§ C6-9. Unpaid state and county taxes deemed city taxes after
payment thereof to county.
Upon payment by the city to the County Commissioner of Finance of the full
amount of unpaid state and county taxes, as hereinbefore provided, such
unpaid taxes, as set forth upon the state and county tax roll in and for the
city, shall be due and owing to the city, shall be deemed city taxes and
shall be a lien upon the real estate against which they were levied. The city
shall collect such taxes, together with the penalties and interest thereon, in
accordance with the provisions of law relating to the collection of city taxes,
and all provisions of law relating to ordinary city taxes shall apply to all such
taxes, penalties and interest.
§ C6-10. Assessments for city taxes.
For the purpose of the assessment of city taxes, the original assessment roll
made by the Assessor and hereinbefore required to be completed and filed
with the City Clerk-Treasurer by the first day of August in each year, or a
certified copy thereof made by the City Clerk-Treasurer and not used for the
assessment of state and county taxes, shall constitute the city assessment
roll for the ensuing year.
§ C6-11. Levying of city taxes and warrant for the collection thereof.
If a special election is required to be held in that year, then immediately
after the holding of such election, the Common Council shall cause the
amounts authorized to be raised for all city purposes to be levied and
assessed upon the property of each person, company, corporation or
association appearing on said assessment rolls as the owner and to be set
opposite the name of such person, company, corporation or association,
respectively, in the column of said tax rolls to be headed "City taxes," in
proportion to the valuation therein stated. After said assessment roll has
been so completed and the taxes thereon extended, the same shall be
confirmed and adopted by a resolution of the Common Council, and filed
with the City Clerk-Treasurer, and when the warrant hereinafter provided
for is annexed thereto, shall become the tax roll of said city. At the first
Common Council meeting in March of each year, or as soon thereafter as
practicable, the Common Council shall cause to be annexed to said roll a
warrant under the corporate seal of the city, signed by the Mayor or Acting
Mayor, or a majority of the members of the Common Council, directing the
City Clerk-Treasurer, as Collector of Taxes in and for said city, to receive and
collect, from the several persons, companies, corporations and associations
named in said tax roll, the several sums mentioned and set down opposite
their respective names as taxes for general city and other purposes, in
the manner in this Charter provided. Said city tax roll shall also contain a
column headed "local assessments," and the Common Council of said city
§ C6-8 PORT JERVIS CODE § C6-11
C:48
is hereby authorized to levy and incorporate in said roll and add thereto,
opposite the name of any person, company, corporation or association liable
therefor, in said column headed "local assessments," the amount of any
such local assessment for any purpose specified in Article V of this Charter,
and thereby cause the same to be collected at the same time and in the
same manner as other city taxes are hereby authorized to be collected; or
it may cause a separate tax roll to be issued for the collection of such local
assessment as hereinbefore provided.
§ C6-12. Arrears.
In addition to said city tax roll, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall, annually,
before any taxes for the year are collected, cause to be entered the word
"arrears" or "sold," as the fact may be, opposite the assessment of any
property thereon, either on which any local assessment shall remain unpaid
which was due or confirmed during the previous fiscal year, or which may
have been sold for any tax or assessment, and yet be redeemable.
§ C6-13. Tax receipts.
Immediately upon receiving any tax or assessment, the City Clerk-
Treasurer, as Collector, shall enter in a column provided for the purpose,
and opposite the name of the person paying the same, the fact of payment
and the date thereof, and shall give the person paying the same a receipt
therefor. Such receipt shall specify the date of such payment, the name of
the person making the payment, the description of the property as shown
on the tax roll, the name of the person to whom the same is assessed, the
amount of such tax and the amount of the fees, interest or penalty collected
therewith and the date of delivery to said City Clerk-Treasurer of the tax
roll on account of which such tax was paid. Any person may pay one (1) or
more taxes or assessments upon his property, leaving others unpaid to be
enforced in the manner provided by this Charter. All receipts issued by said
City Clerk-Treasurer for taxes paid to him shall be numbered consecutively,
commencing with the number one (1) on the first receipt issued for taxes
for any one year, and he shall not receipt for more than one (1) year's taxes
on the same property, on any one tax receipt; but shall use a separate and
distinct series of numbers and receipts for the taxes of each year for which
the same are levied and assessed. The City Clerk-Treasurer shall cause all
tax receipts to be printed and numbered and firmly bound together in book
form, so arranged that when a receipt is torn therefrom a corresponding
stub will remain, and at the time of giving such receipt the City Clerk-
Treasurer shall make the same entries on the corresponding stub as are
required to be made on the receipt. Such book shall be subject to public
inspection and shall remain on file in the office of the City Clerk-Treasurer
as a part of the public records.
§ C6-14. Notice of unpaid taxes and demand of payment.
If any such tax or assessment shall remain unpaid on the first day of July
after publication of the notices hereinafter required to be given pursuant
§ C6-11 CHARTER § C6-14
C:49
to § C6-17, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall serve or cause to be served upon
the person, company, corporation or association, against whom such tax
or assessment remains charged, a written notice requiring said person,
company, corporation or association to pay the same within a time to
be therein specified. Such notice may be served upon any such person,
company, corporation or association personally or by leaving it at the last
known residence or place of business of said person, company, corporation
or association in said city, or by depositing it in the post office in said
city, properly enclosed in a postpaid wrapper, directed to said person,
company, corporation or association at the last known residence or place of
business of said person, company, corporation or association. It shall not be
necessary to make any other demand of payment of said tax.
§ C6-15. Collection of taxes by sale of personal property.
If any person, company, corporation or association shall neglect or refuse to
pay any tax or assessment charged against him, her or them within the time
specified in the preceding section, the City Clerk-Treasurer may proceed to
levy upon any personal property of such person, company, corporation or
association in the County of Orange and sell the same. Such levy and sale
and the disposition of the proceeds thereof shall be made in accordance
with the provisions of the Real Property Tax Law of the State of New York.
§ C6-16. Lien of taxes.
From the time of receipt of the tax roll and warrant by the City Clerk-
Treasurer as Collector, all taxes assessed and levied upon any real estate
set forth in such tax roll and warrant shall be a lien upon such real estate
for the amount thereof, with penalties and interest, until the same shall be
fully paid.
§ C6-17. Proceedings of City Clerk-Treasurer in collecting city
taxes. [Amended 12-22-1997 by L.L. No. 11-1997]
Upon receiving said tax roll and warrant, the City Clerk-Treasurer, as
Collector of Taxes, shall cause a notice thereof to be published in the
official newspaper once a week for two (2) successive weeks, stating that
he will attend at his office with said roll and warrant for the month of
April, Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays excepted, from 9:00 a.m. to
4:00 p.m., prevailing time, to receive such taxes and assessments, and that
during said month of April one-half (1/2) of said taxes and assessments
shall be payable without penalty or interest thereon. If said first installment
remains unpaid after the 30th day of April, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall
collect, in addition to said installment, 6% of said installment. At least five
(5) and not more than ten (10) days before the first day of June in the
same year, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall publish in the same manner a
similar notice stating that he will attend at his office with said roll and
warrant for the month of June, from 9:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m., prevailing
time, to receive the second one-half (1/2) of said taxes and assessments,
and that during said month of June the second one-half (1/2) of said taxes
§ C6-14 PORT JERVIS CODE § C6-17
C:50
and assessments shall be payable without penalty or interest thereon. If
said second installment remains unpaid after the 30th day of June, the
City Clerk-Treasurer shall collect, in addition to said installment, 6% of the
amount of said installment. On all taxes and assessments remaining unpaid
after the 30th day of June, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall collect, in addition
to said 6%, interest at the rate of one per centum (1%) per month from
the first day of July, which percentage and interest shall belong to the city.
Payment of the second installment of any tax or assessment levied on the
annual city tax roll shall not be made until the first installment of taxes and
assessments levied on said roll against the same property, together with any
penalty and interest thereon, is paid. Such warrant shall be returnable at
such time as the Common Council shall direct, which time may be extended
from time to time by resolution of a majority of the Common Council, and
said Common Council is also hereby authorized to issue a new warrant for
the collection of any such taxes and assessments, and shall specify in such
warrant when the same shall be returned, and the same proceedings may
be had thereon as upon the first warrant. The taxes and assessments upon
any real estate occupied by any person, company, corporation or association
other than the owner may be paid by the occupant, and he shall have the
right and is hereby authorized and empowered to collect and retain the
amount thereof, if paid by him from, or set off the amount thereof against,
the claim of the owner for rent.
§ C6-18. Bond of the City Clerk-Treasurer for collection of city
taxes.
Within five (5) days of the issuance of the warrant for collection of city
taxes and assessments by the Common Council to the City Clerk-Treasurer,
said City Clerk-Treasurer, as Collector of Taxes, shall execute to the City of
Port Jervis a bond in the amount of said taxes issued by a surety company
qualified to do business in the State of New York, providing that he will
faithfully discharge his duties as Collector of Taxes, pay over all moneys
received by him and account for said sums in the manner and time provided
by said warrant and by law. The bond, with the approval of the Mayor
and Corporation Counsel endorsed thereon, shall be filed in the office of
the Orange County Clerk as are the bonds of town officers who collect or
receive taxes and assessments. Thereafter, said bond shall be a lien on all
the real property held jointly or severally by the City Clerk-Treasurer or
his sureties, within the county at the time of the filing thereof, and shall
continue to be such lien until its conditions, together with all costs and
charges which may accrue from the prosecution thereof, shall be satisfied
and discharged by law. The expense of securing such bond shall be paid by
the city.
§ C6-19. Proceedings in case of failure to collect tax on warrant.
At the expiration of six (6) months after any tax or assessment shall have
been imposed upon any real estate in said city, the City Clerk-Treasurer,
as Collector, shall make and present to the Common Council, at a regular
meeting thereof, a transcript of any and all such taxes or assessments which
§ C6-17 CHARTER § C6-19
C:51
remain unpaid, and a statement of the amount of the interest and penalties
due thereon, and to which shall be attached the certificate of said City
Clerk-Treasurer that said taxes remain unpaid; such certificate shall be
presumptive evidence of the truth of the statements therein in all courts
and places, and in all actions and proceedings, and any tax roll filed with
the City Clerk-Treasurer, or a copy of the same certified by him, shall be
presumptive evidence of the contents thereof, and the regularity of such
assessment in all courts and places, actions and proceedings, and of the
right to levy and tax or make any assessments therein mentioned. Said
Common Council shall as soon as practicable thereafter review such unpaid
taxes and assessments and correct all errors of every description, except
valuation, which have been made, either in the original assessments or
subsequent proceedings, and shall make or cause to be made a correct and
full description of the several parcels of land, giving the location thereof
and the lot number, if any, or boundaries of such parcel, and the size or
estimated quantity of land in each parcel; and in case any such lands shall
have been erroneously assessed, then said Common Council shall make,
or cause to be made, and include in said statement a correct assessment
thereof at the same valuation as fixed in the original assessment roll, after
giving at least ten (10) days' notice to the person whose land is affected
thereby in the manner hereinafter provided, and such corrected assessment
and amount of taxes levied upon such lands shall be as valid and effectual
for all purposes as though they had been originally correct. Said corrected
lists, including the descriptions of the lands upon which said taxes or
assessments remain unpaid, shall be prepared under the supervision of the
City Clerk-Treasurer, and it shall be the duty of any and all officers of said
city to render such assistance as may be necessary or required in obtaining
correct descriptions of such several parcels of land. Said Common Council
shall have power and jurisdiction and it is hereby authorized, empowered
and directed in all cases where any tax or assessment levied or imposed, or
attempted to be levied or imposed, by the Board of Trustees of the Village
of Port Jervis, on any land in said former village and now included within
said city, at any time within ten (10) years prior to the incorporation of the
City of Port Jervis, remains unpaid and in arrears, to add all such taxes
and assessments, with a description of the parcel of land against which
they were levied or attempted to be levied, to the list or statement in and
by this section directed to be prepared, upon the same notice and in the
same manner and with the same effect as herein provided for arrears of
city taxes, and shall treat the same without regard to any supposed want of
jurisdiction, irregularity or defect, imposing or confining any of said taxes
or assessments so in arrears. When there is more than one (1) tax upon
the same parcel of land, the description of said parcel shall be inserted
in said list or statement but once, and the collection of all such taxes and
assessments shall be enforced by a sale of the real estate in the manner
hereinafter provided. The notice in and by this section required to be given
to persons whose lands are affected, by reason of being placed on said list
or statement of arrears, shall designate a time when, and a place where, the
Common Council will meet to hear objections to any tax or assessment so in
arrears, and any reason why any part of such arrearages should be reduced
§ C6-19 PORT JERVIS CODE § C6-19
C:52
or remitted; and it shall be the duty of any owner or person having any
interest in or lien on said lands affected by said arrearages, and desiring to
make objections thereto, to file with the City Clerk-Treasurer, on or before
the day of such hearing, a brief and concise statement in writing of such
objections to said arrearages and their reasons why the same or any part
thereof should be reduced or remitted, and to serve a copy of said statement
on the Corporation Counsel within the same time. Said statement shall be
verified in the same manner as a pleading in an action in the Supreme
Court, and any person who shall file and serve such objections shall be
heard before said Common Council in person or by counsel, if he demand
such hearing, in a notice endorsed on or attached to said objections and
filed therewith, at the meeting herein provided for, or at such other time and
place as said Common Council may designate. Said Common Council shall
have power to call witnesses and examine them under oath, in relation to all
matters concerning said taxes and assessments so in arrears, and compel
the production of papers and documents, and it shall be the duty of the
Corporation Counsel to assist in any such examination. The notice in and
by this section required to be given shall be served on the owner, occupant,
tenant or agent of the property affected, if known, either personally or by
leaving it at his last known residence or place of business in said city, or by
depositing it in the post office in said city properly enclosed in a postpaid
wrapper, directed to him at his last known place of residence or business.
If such owner is unknown and the property is vacant and unoccupied,
service may be made by affixing said notice upon a conspicuous part of said
premises at least ten (10) days before the date of said hearing. Affidavits of
due service of the notices in this section required to be given shall be made
and filed in the office of the City Clerk-Treasurer and shall become a public
record, and shall be prima facie evidence in all courts and places of the facts
therein stated. The determination of said Common Council in reference to
said arrearages shall be final and conclusive upon all persons.
§ C6-20. Sale of lands for unpaid taxes. [Amended 7-27-2015 by L.L.
No. 5-2015, approved 7-27-2015]
Prior to the date set for the sale of land for taxes, the Common Council
may vote to exclude some of the parcels included on the list of delinquent
properties from the properties offered to the public at tax sale pursuant
to Section C6-20 of the Charter of the City of Port Jervis. The Common
Council must vote to accept a bid on behalf of the City of Port Jervis for
those excluded parcels to be retained by the City on the date designated
for the tax sale for the sums owed the City for each lot or parcel with the
result that those designated lots and parcels shall not be available or offered
to the public at the tax sale conducted by the City Clerk-Treasurer. The
City shall be designated as the sole and successful bidder for those parcels
designated in the Common Council's resolution bidding upon and retaining
said lots and parcels. Said lots so retained by the City shall still be subject
to provisions of Sections C6-24, C6-25, C6-26 and C6-27 of the Charter of
the City of Port Jervis, as amended herein, relating to redemption from tax
sale, as well as all of the remaining Sections of Article VI of the Charter of
§ C6-19 CHARTER § C6-20
C:53
the City of Port Jervis relating to the conveyance of real estate sold for taxes
or otherwise.
§ C6-21. Notice of the sale of land for taxes.
The City Clerk-Treasurer shall cause a list of all the lots and parcels of
land, the taxes on which have been returned as unpaid, and descriptions
of which have been placed on said list of arrears, together with such
descriptions, to be published in the official city newspaper once in each
week for four (4) successive weeks, next preceding a day to be hereby
specified and fixed for the sale of such lands, together with a notice, that if
such taxes, assessments, fees and penalties be not paid to the City Clerk-
Treasurer, with interest, penalties and expenses, on or before the day fixed
for such sale, such lands will be sold at public auction at the time and
place designated, to the highest bidder. If such taxes, interest, penalties
and expenses be not paid, the lands so advertised shall be sold by the City
Clerk-Treasurer. Before the sale, the owner of any parcel of land, or his
representative, or any person interested therein, may avoid the sale thereof
by paying the tax or assessment to the City Clerk-Treasurer, with all accrued
interest, penalties, fees, additions and expenses.
§ C6-22. Manner of conducting sale of land for taxes.
On the day named in the notice of sale, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall
commence the sale of such lands and shall continue such sale thereafter
from day to day successively until the whole thereof shall be sold, except
that adjournments may be made over Saturdays, Sundays and legal
holidays. Each parcel shall be sold at public auction to the highest bidder.
The purchasers at such sales shall pay the amount required to complete
their respective purchases to the City Clerk-Treasurer forthwith after each
parcel shall be struck off, and upon their failure so to do, the City Clerk-
Treasurer shall than and there reoffer the parcel for sale again without any
additional notice, as though said parcel had not been struck off. Should
there be no bid of the amount due on any lot or parcel of land to be sold,
then the City Clerk-Treasurer shall bid in the same for the city, and the
city is hereby authorized to acquire said parcels and the Common Council
shall have the care and control of all such parcels and may lease, sell or
convey the same. The City Clerk-Treasurer shall keep a record of every such
sale in a book to be kept for that purpose. As soon as practicable after
the sale, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall prepare, execute and acknowledge
three (3) certificates of sale of each parcel of land so sold; one (1) of said
certificates shall be delivered to the purchaser, one (1) filed in the City
Clerk-Treasurer's office and one (1) filed in the office of the Clerk of Orange
County within ten (10) days after the close of such sale. If there be two (2) or
more purchasers, a certificate shall be delivered to each. Such certificates
shall contain a brief general description of the parcel sold, the time of
the sale, the name of the purchaser, the amount bid and paid therefor,
the name of the person or persons against whom such tax or assessment
was levied, a statement of the fact that said premises were sold to pay a
tax or assessment and the time when such sale will become absolute and
§ C6-20 PORT JERVIS CODE § C6-22
C:54
the purchaser be entitled to a conveyance according to law. The certificate
herein required to be filed in the Orange County Clerk's office shall be
recorded by said Clerk in the same manner as deeds are required by law
to be recorded and shall be indexed against the party assessed as the
grantor, adding thereto "by the City of Port Jervis," and in the name of the
purchaser as grantee. The expense of filing and recording such certificate
shall be a part of the expenses of sale to be included therein and collected
therewith. No error in the description of lands in any list published in any
newspaper shall render any sale void or in any manner affect its validity.
If from any cause the City Clerk-Treasurer shall be unable to attend at the
time and place of the sale, the Common Council, or in case it shall not have
acted, the Mayor or Acting Mayor, shall designate some other city officer
to conduct the sale, and all sales made by any such designated officer shall
have the same force and effect as if made by the City Clerk-Treasurer. In
making sales of real estate under the provisions of this Article, the officer
making the same shall require the purchaser to pay, forthwith after a sale,
a sum sufficient to pay the tax, assessment, interest, expenses and charges
against the parcel so sold, and the terms of sale shall require the purchaser
to pay the balance of the amount bid, if any there shall be, to the City
Clerk-Treasurer within five (5) days after the time for redemption of such
real estate shall expire, according to the provisions of the Article. At the
time and place of each sale, each purchaser shall sign a memorandum of
purchase, in which shall be incorporated his agreement to pay the amount
of his bid in accordance with the terms of this section.
§ C6-23. Disposition of proceeds of sale.
The proceeds of the sale of each parcel of land sold shall be applied to the
payment of the expenses of the sale as herein provided, and the payment of
the tax, assessment and penalty or interest for which it was sold. The City
Clerk-Treasurer, after the period of redemption shall have expired, shall pay
any surplus which may be paid to him in a case where the bid exceeds
the tax, assessment, penalty or interest, and costs and expenses of sale as
hereinbefore provided, to the person or persons entitled thereto, and such
person or persons shall be ascertained in the same manner and by the same
proceedings as in the case of a surplus arising from the foreclosure of a
mortgage on real estate. In case any taxes shall be assessed and levied
on real estate which has been sold for taxes, subsequent to such sale, and
before the redemption thereof or conveyance thereof to the purchaser, and
the same shall be unpaid, the City Clerk-Treasurer may deduct the amount
thereof from any surplus in his hands of the sum bid for the sale, if there
be any surplus; if there be no surplus, or the same shall be insufficient to
pay such taxes, the person redeeming shall pay the same, otherwise the
purchaser shall pay the same before he shall receive his conveyance for the
land so sold.
§ C6-22 CHARTER § C6-24
C:55
§ C6-24. Redemption from tax sale. [Amended 7-27-2015 by L.L. No.
5-2015, approved 7-27-2015]
The owner of any real estate sold at a City Tax Sale, may redeem same
from such sale at any time within two (2) years from the date of said sale
by paying to the City Clerk-Treasurer for the use of the purchaser, his
heirs or assigns, or, if the same shall have been redeemed by any other
person than the owner thereof, then for the use of such person, such sum
or amount as may have been paid for by the purchaser at or before the
time of receiving his certificate, together with interest thereon from the
date of said certificate at the rate of twelve per centum (12%) per annum,
and all other sums which he may have paid for taxes or assessments on
said real estate, together with interest thereon from the date of any such
payments, at the rate of twelve per centum (12%) per annum. In all cases
of redemption it shall be necessary to pay, in addition to the amounts above
provided for, the amount of any other tax or assessment which has been
levied upon such property, subsequent to the sale thereof, and also the
actual and necessary expenses which have been incurred by the purchaser
in the service of notices herein provided to be given, in reference to the
redemption of said property, and also any and all expenses incurred by
the city in connection therewith since said sale; and on such payments'
being made, the title acquired by such sale shall cease and determine. In
computing interest upon any sum required to be paid to redeem any such
parcel of land, interest shall be computed for no less a period than one (1)
month. Where payments are made during any month of the period limited
for redemption, interest shall be computed for the whole of that month. In
case of the redemption of any land sold as herein provided, by the person
who was the owner thereof at the time of the sale, the City Clerk-Treasurer
shall give such owner a receipt for the amount paid by him to effect such
redemption, and on the production thereof by such owner to the County
Clerk of Orange County, and the payment of his fees therefor, such Clerk
shall cancel the certificate of sale by a proper entry upon the record of
such certificate in his office. Said sale shall likewise be canceled by the
City Clerk-Treasurer upon the record thereof kept in his office. In case such
payment is made by the owner of said real estate, then and in the event
all mortgages, judgments, decrees or claims which were a lien upon said
real estate at the time the tax or assessment for which the sale has been
made became a lien thereon, or which were liens at any time before such
sale was made, shall be and remain liens upon said real estate, anything
hereinbefore contained to the contrary notwithstanding.
§ C6-25. Lien of mortgage; when not affected by tax sale. [Amended
7-27-2015 by L.L. No. 5-2015, approved 7-27-2015]
The lien of a mortgage, duly recorded or registered at the time of the sale
of any lands for nonpayment of any tax or assessment thereon, shall not be
in any manner affected, except as provided in this section. The purchaser
at any such sale shall give to the mortgagee a written notice of such sale
within six (6) months from the expiration of the time to redeem, requiring
him to pay the amount of purchase money, with interest at the rate allowed
§ C6-24 PORT JERVIS CODE § C6-25
C:56
by law in case of redemption by occupants within six (6) months after
giving the notice. Such notice must be given by personal service upon the
mortgagee at the last known address for said mortgagee, and an Affidavit of
such service, in recordable form, shall be kept by the City. The City Clerk-
Treasurer shall receive from each Tax Sale purchaser a mortgagee search
certified as correct by a licensed New York State title insurance agent, paid
for by the Tax Sale purchaser on each parcel. Said search must contain
the last known name and address of the mortgagee on each parcel. If the
mortgagee fails to comply with the requirements of such notice within the
time herein specified, the lien of such mortgage, upon the lands so sold,
shall thereby be canceled. The City of Port Jervis shall be obligated to
comply with all of the foregoing requirements to be performed or completed
by Tax Sale purchasers as set forth in this Section for those properties
excluded from the Tax Sale and retained by the City of Port Jervis.
§ C6-26. Redemption by mortgagee.
The holder of any mortgage which is duly recorded at the time of the sale
may, at any time after the sale of all or any part of the mortgaged premises
for unpaid taxes, and before the expiration of six (6) months from the giving
of the notice mentioned in the preceding section, redeem the premises so
sold, or any part thereof, from such sale. Such redemption shall be made
by filing with the City Clerk-Treasurer a written description of his mortgage
and paying to him for the use of the purchaser, or his legal representatives,
heirs or assigns, the sum hereinbefore required to be paid for the purpose
of redeeming such lot, together with interest at the rate allowed by this
Article, and all costs and expenses which have accrued thereon. The holder
of such mortgage shall have a lien upon the premises redeemed for the

§ C6-27. Notice of redemption. [Amended 7-27-2015 by L.L. No.

newspaper of the city. A copy of such notice shall be served personally
on the owner or occupant of the lands, or, if unoccupied, posted on the
premises, at least twenty (20) days before the expiration of such time for
final redemption. The publication and service of such notice shall bar and
preclude any and all persons except the purchaser or the City of Port Jervis,
having excluded and retained said lot or parcel from Tax Sale, on such sale,
or his assigns, or the person finally redeeming, from claiming any interest
§ C6-25 CHARTER § C6-27

affidavit of his having complied with the conditions of the Article, stating
particularly the facts relied upon as such compliance, to which affidavit
shall be attached proof of the service of the notices hereinbefore required
to be given. Such affidavit and proof shall be delivered to the City Clerk-
Treasurer, to be by him entered in the records of his office and carefully
preserved among the files, and such records and affidavit shall be prima
facie evidence of the facts therein stated.
§ C6-29. Conveyance of real estate sold for taxes. [Amended
7-27-2015 by L.L. No. 5-2015, approved 7-27-2015]
At any time after the expiration of two (2) years from the date of sale of any
lot or parcel of land for taxes or assessments, if the same or any part thereof
shall not have been redeemed as herein provided, the City Clerk-Treasurer,
upon request, and on the production of the certificate of purchase, and upon
compliance by the purchaser or the City of Port Jervis, having excluded
and retained said lot or parcel from Tax Sale, or his assignee with all
requirements of this Article, and filing the proof thereof as required in the
preceding section, shall execute and deliver to the purchaser, including
the City of Port Jervis, or its or his heirs, successors or assigns, a deed of
conveyance of the real estate so sold for taxes and not redeemed, under his
hand and the seal of the city, and attested by the Mayor or Acting Mayor of
the city, and such deed shall vest in the grantee, or his heirs, successors or
assigns, an absolute estate in fee simple; and such deed, when so executed,
shall be conclusive evidence that the sale was regular, and also presumptive
evidence that all previous proceedings were regular according to the law
and provisions of this Charter. After two (2) years from the date of such
conveyance, such presumption shall in every particular be conclusive. Every
certificate or conveyance executed in pursuance of this Charter may, when
acknowledged, be recorded in the same manner and with like effect as a
deed acknowledged or proved before any officer authorized by law to take
the proof and acknowledgment of deeds.
§ C6-30. Possession of premises. [Amended 7-27-2015 by L.L. No.
5-2015, approved 7-27-2015]
The purchaser or the City of Port Jervis, having excluded and retained said
lot or parcel from Tax Sale, may at any time after the delivery of the deed
of conveyance, and not before, obtain actual possession of the premises by
an action or proceeding at law, or by causing the occupant of such real
estate to be removed therefrom, and the possession thereof to be delivered
§ C6-27 PORT JERVIS CODE § C6-30
C:58
to him in the manner and by the same proceedings, by and before the same
officers, as in the case of a tenant's holding over after the expiration of his
term without the permission of his landlord.
§ C6-31. Collection of taxes by civil action.
In addition to the remedies hereinbefore provided for the collection of
unpaid taxes and assessments, the Common Council shall have power, at
any time after the expiration of six (6) months from the time when the
warrant for the same was issued to the City Clerk-Treasurer, to collect, by
civil action in the name of the City of Port Jervis, any city tax imposed for
any of the purposes in this Charter mentioned; and all assessment rolls
and certificates and special assessments filed with, or delivered to, the
City Clerk-Treasurer, or a certified copy thereof, shall be evidence in all
courts and places, and in all actions and proceedings, that the taxes and
assessments therein contained have been regularly and duly assessed and
imposed and of the right of the city for the recovery thereof. Any civil action
so brought shall not impair or affect the lien of such tax or assessment
upon any real estate against which it is assessed, or be held to constitute
a bar to any proceeding for the sale of the lands upon which such tax or
assessment is a lien. Such civil action may be brought against any person,
company, corporation or association liable for such tax or assessment, or
against their legal representatives, successors or assigns, in any court of
competent jurisdiction; and the amount collected by any such suit shall
be used and applied by said City Clerk-Treasurer in the same manner as
though the same had been collected by the sale of real estate. Any judgment
which may be recovered for such tax or assessment shall include such tax or
assessment with interest, penalties and the costs and disbursements of the
action, and may be enforced against any property of the defendant within
the state.
§ C6-32. Reimbursement of purchase money.
Whenever any purchaser under such sale, or his heirs or assigns, shall be
unable to recover or retain possession of any real estate sold to him, by
reason of irregularity or error in the assessment of any person or property,
or the levying of any tax thereon, or in any proceeding for the collection of
any tax, the Common Council shall reimburse the purchase money so paid
with interest from the time of its payment at the rate of six per centum
(6%) per annum, the amount thereof to be presented and audited as other
city charges; and thereupon the Common Council of said city shall make
a reassessment of any amount or sums so paid upon the same real estate
or against the same person, in the same manner as hereinafter provided,
which assessment shall, for all purposes of this Charter, be deemed and
taken to be an original general city tax as of the date of such assessment.
§ C6-33. Validity of tax and action to test same.
It shall be presumed that every tax levied is valid and regular, and that
all the steps as required by law were taken and had until the contrary
§ C6-30 CHARTER § C6-33
C:59
shall be made to appear. Any action or proceeding commenced by any
person or persons to test the validity or regularity of any tax levied shall
be commenced within one (1) year from the date of the delivery to the City
Clerk-Treasurer, as Collector, of the roll in which said tax is contained. The
invalidity or irregularity of any tax shall not be available as a defense to
any action or proceeding commenced after the expiration of one (1) year
from the delivery of the roll, as aforesaid, for the collection of said tax or
assessment, or for the enforcement of any right or title by virtue of any sale
thereunder, unless an action or proceeding to test the validity or regularity
of such tax shall have been commenced within the time hereinbefore limited
for commencing the same, and shall be still pending, or such tax shall have
been adjudged to be irregular or invalid.
§ C6-34. Cancellation of tax.
Where the invalidity or irregularity of any tax or assessment appears upon
the face of the proceedings, any party in interest may, after having made
application to the Common Council of the city as herein provided, apply by
petition to the Supreme Court for an order canceling the same. Said Court
shall require reasonable notice to be given to the city of such petition, and
shall hear the proofs and allegations of the parties, and shall, in case such
irregularity or invalidity is established, order such tax to be canceled, and
thereupon the same shall be canceled by the City Clerk-Treasurer.
§ C6-35. Power of Common Council as to void and erroneous
assessments.
The Common Council of the city may, at its discretion, release, discharge,
remit or commute any portion of the taxes assessed or levied against any
person or property for any error, irregularity or omission in the levying
of said taxes, or in any of the proceedings in relation to the same. In
case any assessment shall remain unpaid on account of any irregularity,
omission or error in any assessment authorized by this Charter, or the laws
in force when such tax was levied, or in case of error in the description of
lands or in the description of the owner or occupants, the Common Council
may, in its discretion, or upon the application of any person interested,
proceed to correct such irregularity, omission or error, or cancel, remit or
commute such tax, or cause the amount so unpaid to be reassessed on the
property, the assessment against which remains unpaid, or upon the owner
or occupant thereof; and the Common Council is hereby authorized and
empowered to make such reassessment upon giving ten (10) days' personal
notice thereof to the owner, agent or occupant of the property against
which the amount remains so unpaid. It may direct the City Clerk-Treasurer
to correct any irregularity, omission or error, and such reassessment or
correction shall have the same effect as if the said assessment had been
properly made. But the Common Council shall not alter any valuation made
by the Assessor. Any omission to comply with the provisions of this Charter
in making an assessment or levying a tax, or creating a lien, shall not render
such assessment, or the tax levied thereunder or the assessment made or
lien created thereby, void, but shall be treated as an irregularity merely,
§ C6-33 PORT JERVIS CODE § C6-35
C:60
and it shall be the duty of any and all courts, in case it shall appear that
such irregularity exists, to direct the same to be corrected or amended or
the omission supplied, if possible. In case any tax or assessment shall be
void, or have failed for want or jurisdiction or for any irregularity, mistake
or inadvertence in levying or assessing the same, the Common Council shall
have the power, and it shall be its duty, to cause the same to be reassessed
in a proper manner. Any sum paid thereon shall be credited upon the tax so
reassessed, and, if the sum paid shall exceed the amount so reassessed, the
excess shall be refunded to the person entitled thereto.
§ C6-36. Collection of local assessments.
Whenever an assessment shall be ordered for local improvements, if the
assessment is not added to the general city tax list, the assessment shall be
made to resemble in form, as nearly as practicable, the tax list issued for
general city purposes, and be provided with a column in which payments
can be entered by the City Clerk-Treasurer. All provisions of this Charter
relating to the collection of taxes shall be applicable to the collection of
local assessments, except so far as they are herein modified or specifically
provided for.

A. This chapter is enacted pursuant to the New York Municipal Home Rule
Law and the Agriculture and Markets Law to provide for the licensing,
identification and control of dogs. Effective January 1, 2011, the State
of New York has relinquished the responsibility of dog licensing
function to local municipalities and will eliminate the Animal Population
Control Fund. Local municipalities will now be required to adopt
legislation relating to this issue, which is the purpose of this article.
B. This chapter is enacted pursuant to the provisions of Article 7 of the
Agriculture and Markets Law as amended by Part T of Chapter 59 of the
Laws of 2010 and the Municipal Home Rule Law of the State of New
York, as the same may be subsequently amended and supplemented.
C. All words, terms or phrases used herein shall have the meanings
indicated below or as defined in the Agriculture and Markets Law. If no
specific definition is set forth, all words shall have their usual and

identification number, as required by the provisions of this section.
OWNER  Any person who harbors or keeps any dog.
D. Chapter 215 of the Port Jervis City Code as it currently exists shall
herein and hereby be repealed and, in its place and stead, this chapter
is enacted and shall be designated as the new Chapter 215 of the Port
Jervis City Code and shall be entitled "Dog Control."
E. Dog licensing requirements, procedures and fees.
(1) License application.
(a) The owner of any dog reaching the age of four months shall
immediately make application for a dog license. No license
§ 215-1 ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES § 215-1
210:173
shall be required for any dog under the age of four months
that is not at large or that is residing in a pound or shelter
maintained by or under contract or agreement with the state or
any county, city, town or village, any duly incorporated society
for the prevention of cruelty to animals, duly incorporated
humane society or duly incorporated dog protective society.
(b) Application for a dog license shall be made to the Clerk and
shall be accompanied by the appropriate license fee, as
specified below.
(c) The application shall state the sex, actual or approximate year
of birth, breed, color(s), and municipal identification number of
the dog, and other identification marks, if any, and the name,
address, telephone number, county and residence of owner,
and such other information as deemed necessary by the Clerk.
(d) In the case of a spayed or neutered dog, every application shall
be accompanied by a certificate signed by a licensed
veterinarian showing that the dog has been spayed or
neutered, provided that such certificate shall not be required if
the same is already on file with the Clerk.
(e) The application shall be accompanied by a statement certified
by a licensed veterinarian showing that the dog or dogs have
been vaccinated to prevent rabies or, in lieu thereof, a
statement certified by a licensed veterinarian stating that
because of age or other reason, the life of the dog or dogs
would be endangered by the administration of vaccine. The
Clerk shall make or cause to be made from such statement a
record of such information and file such record with a copy of
the license.
(2) License fees. The fee for a dog license shall be set by resolution of
the Common Council, from time to time.
(a) Upon submission of proper documentation, there shall be no
fee charged for the license issued for any detection dog, guide
dog, hearing dog, police work dog, service dog, therapy dog,
war dog or working search dog, as such terms are defined by
the Agriculture and Markets Law or by Article I of this Chapter
215.
(b) In addition to other applicable fees, any person applying for a
dog license for a dog indentified as unlicensed during an
enumeration shall pay an additional fee of $25. Such additional
fee shall be used to pay the expenses incurred by the City in
conducting the enumeration, if the City conducts such an
enumeration. In the event that the additional fees collected
exceed the expenses incurred by the City in conducting an
enumeration in any year, such excess fees may be used by the
City for any other lawful purpose.

210:174

have been due and payable in such prior years along with the
licensing fees due and payable for the current year for which
such person is applying for a dog license. By way of example, if
the owner of a dog applies for a dog license to cover the year
from May 1, 2015, through April 30, 2016, but should have
obtained or renewed a license for that dog for the prior three
years and failed to do so, such person must pay the licensing
fees for the year May 1, 2015, through April 30, 2016, as well
as the applicable licensing fees for the prior three years.
(3) Upon validation by the Clerk, the application shall become a license
for the dog described therein. Once an application has been
validated, no refund shall be made.
(4) The Clerk shall provide a copy of the license to the owner and
retain a record of the license in either paper or electronic format.
(5) A license shall be renewed after a period of one year beginning
with the first day of the month following the date of issuance.
Renewal shall be for a minimum of one year and shall not exceed
three years, based on the validation term of the rabies vaccination.
(6) No license shall be transferable. Upon the transfer of ownership of
any dog, the new owner shall immediately make application for a
license for such dog. The original issued identification tag shall
remain the same for the life of the dog.
(7) No dog can be adopted out of the City's animal shelter without first
obtaining a license from the Clerk.
F. Identification of dogs.
(1) Each dog licensed shall be assigned, at the time the dog is licensed
for the first time, a permanent municipal identification number.
Such identification number shall be carried by the dog on an
identification tag that shall be affixed to a collar on the dog at all
times.
(2) The identification number shall constitute the official identification
of the dog to which it is assigned, regardless of changes of
ownership, and the number shall not be reassigned to any other
dog during the lifetime of the dog to which it is assigned.
(3) At the time a dog is first licensed, one identification tag shall be
furnished to the owner at no charge. Any replacement tag shall be
obtained by the owner at his expense at a fee of $5.
§ 215-1 ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES § 215-1
210:175

the collar of any dog other than the one to which that number has
been assigned.
(5) The identification tag shall be imprinted with the words "City of
Port Jervis" and "State of New York," a unique identification
number, and the telephone number of the Clerk's office.
G. Change of ownership; lost or stolen dogs. In accordance with the
provisions of § 112 of the Agriculture and Markets Law:

assigned an identification number or in the address of the owner of
record of any such dog, the owner of record shall, within 10 days of
such change, notify the Clerk.
(2) If any dog that has been assigned a municipal identification number
is lost or stolen, the owner of record shall, within 10 days of the
discovery of such loss or theft, notify the Clerk.
(3) In the case of a dog's death, the owner of record shall so notify the
Clerk, either prior to renewal of license or upon the time of such
renewal.

and Markets Law:
(1) The Animal/Dog Control Officer shall seize:
(a) Any dog which is not licensed, whether on or off the owner's
premises.

identified pursuant to the provisions of this section and further
provided that the owner pays the following impoundment fees:
(a) Not less than $275 for the first impoundment of a dog owned
by that person.
(b) Not less than $300 for the second impoundment, within one
year of the first impoundment, of any dog owned by that

(6) Prior to releasing a dog to its owner or adopting out a dog, the
Animal/Dog Control Officer shall deliver to the owner a statement

without the corroborating testimony of at least one witness from a
property other than that owned or occupied by the complainant. It shall
be an affirmative defense to such violation if the owner of the dog

dog was being provoked by a person or was acting as a guide dog,
hearing dog, service dog or police work dog.
A. Removal of feces required. Any person owning or in charge of any dog
which soils, defiles, defecates on or commits any feces on any common

This chapter is enacted under the authority of Subdivisions a(1) and (2) and
d(3) of Municipal Home Rule Law § 10(1)(ii) and Municipal Home Rule Law
§ 22. More particularly, it is the expressed intent of the Common Council to
empower to the City to require such payments as a condition of approvals.
§ 272-3. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
APPLICANT  Any person, firm, partnership, association, corporation or
entity, of any type, kind or nature, who requests the City, the Common
Council, the Planning Board, the Zoning Board of Appeals or any other
board, agency, employee or official of the City for approval of a project.
CONSULTANT  Any person or entity of any type who is retained by the
City to provide consulting or professional services for any project, including,
but not necessarily limited to, engineering, planning, legal and stenographic
expenses.
A. The Common Council enacts this chapter to put in place a system for
the reimbursement of fees and expenses which would otherwise be
raised by assessments of the taxpayers of the City to defray the costs of
the City consultants, including, but not limited to, engineering,
planning, legal and stenographic expenses, with respect to the review
of projects as defined in § 272-3 of this chapter. It is the intention of this
chapter that the cost of such consultants ultimately be paid by those
who seek approvals from the City rather than from general City funds.
B. The City also wishes to establish a procedure to be followed requiring
the deposit of those funds in the City's Special Trust and Agency
Account or similar account established by the Common Council and
requiring that payments from that account be made only upon receipt
and approval by the Common Council of itemized vouchers from its
consultants following the determination by the Common Council as set
forth in § 272-5 of this chapter.

in accordance with the above provision.
C. Upon receipt of such monies, the City shall cause such monies to be
placed in the City's Special Trust and Agency Account or similar
account established by the Common Council, without interest accruing
to the applicant, and shall keep a separate record of all such monies so
deposited and the name of the applicant and project for which sums
were deposited.
D. Upon receipt and approval by the Common Council of an itemized
voucher from a consultant for services rendered on behalf of the City
pertaining to the project, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall cause such
voucher to be paid out of the monies so deposited and shall debit the
separate record of the account accordingly.
E. The consultant shall furnish copies of such voucher to the applicant at
the same time such voucher is submitted to the City.

§ 280-1 BURIALS § 280-4
243:255
A. Legislative findings. The Common Council of the City of Port Jervis
hereby finds that there is a present need for park and recreational
facilities in the City and the maintenance and expansion of existing
facilities, based on projected population growth to which all residential
construction will contribute. The Common Council has determined that
a system of parks and recreational facilities to meet the needs of the
residents of the City is preferable. Therefore, the Common Council
determines that it is a proper case that each new residential dwelling
contribute recreation fees. The Common Council determines that the
provisions of this section are consistent with the purposes of General
City Law § 33 and that to the extent, if any, that this section may
hereinafter be determined to be inconsistent, this section shall, as
provided in Article IX of the New York State Constitution and the
Municipal Home Rule Law, supersede such provisions in reference to
the City of Port Jervis.
B. There is hereby imposed a fee in lieu of parkland contribution to be
assessed upon real property in the City of Port Jervis on which new
residential building construction takes place. Such fees shall be levied
and collected in accordance with this section. Such fees shall be called
"recreation fees." The obligation to pay such fees shall be a lien against
the property which shall attach to the new construction as of the time of
approval and shall be satisfied as hereinafter provided. All moneys
collected pursuant to this section shall be used by the City exclusively
for park, playground, and recreational purposes, including the
compensation of employees and the acquisition of property within the
City of Port Jervis.
C. The City of Port Jervis from time to time shall establish the amount of
such fees by resolution of the Common Council. At least once a year, at
the time of the reorganizational meeting, the Common Council shall
consider the adequacy, sufficiency and fairness of the fees to be
charged.
D. Collection of fees.
(1) Each subdivision plat or site plan hereinafter approved shall
contain a note indicating that any property on which new buildings
may be constructed shall be subject to the lien of recreational fees
to be calculated on the number of new dwelling units created.
(2) At the time of issuance of building permits, the applicant shall pay,
in addition to such other fees that may be due, the recreation fees
in the amount of $500 per new residential dwelling unit.
(3) In the event that such fee is not paid at the time of issuance of the
building permit, the amount of such fee shall remain a lien against
the property and shall accrue interest from such time at the rate of
not less than 9% or the judgment rate then current, whichever shall
be greater. No City official shall issue a certificate of occupancy or
other report, certificate, consent or approval concerning such

property unless such official has determined that the fees required
hereby have been paid, that the parcel existed prior to the date of
this section, that the parcel is shown on a plat or site plan approved
prior to the date of this section or that the property is otherwise
exempt from this section.
E. Exemptions. The Common Council may, by resolution, exempt any
property from payment of the recreation fees required by this section
upon a determination that the property owner has dedicated or donated
to the City property of equal or greater value than the estimated
recreation fees which would otherwise be payable or where a residence
has been destroyed by fire or other catastrophe and a new residence
will be constructed. The Common Council's determination shall be final.
F. The neglect or failure of the City to collect such recreational fees at the
time when such fees are due shall not waive the City's right to collect
such fees, together with interest thereon.
G. In the event that the Common Council determines such fees are due and
owing but have not been paid, the Common Council shall, after notice to
the property owner and the provision of an opportunity to be heard,
assess such recreational fees, together with interest and costs related
to such assessment, against such real property. Notice by certified mail
to the address shown on the City's latest assessment roll at least 10
days prior to the date of the hearing shall be deemed good and
sufficient notice. Such assessment shall be levied on the annual state,
county and town real property tax bill.

Administration
§ 288-11. Designation of local administrator.
The Building Official is hereby appointed local administrator to administer
and implement this chapter by granting or denying floodplain development
permits in accordance with its provisions.
§ 288-12. Floodplain development permit.
§ 288-13. Application for permit.
The applicant shall provide the following information as appropriate.
Additional information may be required on the permit application form.
A. Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for all
construction and other development to be undertaken in areas of
special flood hazard in this community for the purpose of protecting its
citizens from increased flood hazards and ensuring that new
development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its exposure to
flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any development in an area
of special flood hazard, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
enumerated in § 288-7, without a valid floodplain development permit.
Application for a permit shall be made on forms furnished by the local
administrator and may include, but not be limited to, plans, in
duplicate, drawn to scale and showing the nature, location, dimensions,
and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures,
fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the
foregoing.
B. Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be
accompanied by an application fee of $100. In addition, the applicant
shall be responsible for reimbursing the City of Port Jervis for any
additional costs necessary for review, inspection and approval of this
project. The local administrator may require a deposit of no more than
$500 to cover these additional costs.
A. The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor
(including basement or cellar) of any new or substantially improved
structure to be located in Zones A1-A30, AE or AH, or Zone A if base
flood elevation data are available. Upon completion of the lowest floor,
the permittee shall submit to the local administrator the as-built
elevation, certified by a licensed professional engineer or surveyor.
B. The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any new
or substantially improved nonresidential structure will be floodproofed.
Upon completion of the floodproofed portion of the structure, the
permittee shall submit to the local administrator the as-built
floodproofed elevation, certified by a professional engineer or surveyor.

utility floodproofing will meet the criteria in § 288-16C, Utilities.
D. A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that any
nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the floodproofing
criteria in § 288-18, Nonresidential, structures.
E. A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or
relocated as a result of proposed development. Computations by a
licensed professional engineer must be submitted that demonstrate
that the altered or relocated segment will provide equal or greater
conveyance than the original stream segment. The applicant must
submit any maps, computations or other material required by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the
documents enumerated in § 288-7, when notified by the local
administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose. The applicant must also provide assurances that the
conveyance capacity of the altered or relocated stream segment will be
maintained.
F. A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, if required by
the local administrator, which shows whether proposed development to
be located in an area of special flood hazard may result in physical
damage to any other property.
G. In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available from other
sources, base flood elevation data shall be provided by the permit
applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments
(including proposals for manufactured home and recreational vehicle
parks and subdivisions) that are greater than either 50 lots or five
acres.
A. Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the
following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(1) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 288-13, Application for permit, and for
compliance with the provisions and standards of this chapter.
(2) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard,
all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
applicable standards of Article V, Construction Standards, and, in
particular § 288-15A, Subdivision proposals.
§ 288-13 PORT JERVIS CODE § 288-14

(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special
flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property
(e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood velocities). The local
administrator may require the applicant to submit additional
technical analyses and data necessary to complete the
determination. If the proposed development may result in physical
damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
Article V, Construction Standards, no permit shall be issued. The
applicant may revise the application to include measures that
mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit the
application.
(4) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
state or federal law.
B. Use of other flood data.

areas of special flood hazard on the community's Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced water surface elevation
data (These areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM.) nor
identified a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 288-13G, as criteria for requiring that new
construction, substantial improvements or other proposed posed
development meet the requirements of this chapter.
(2) When base flood elevation data are not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard for the purposes
of this chapter.
C. Alteration of watercourses.
(1) Notification to adjacent communities and the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting any
alteration or relocation of a water-course, and submittal of
evidence of such notification to the Regional Director, Region II,
Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(2) Determine that the permit holder has provided for maintenance
within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
D. Construction stage.
(1) In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor or
completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially improved
§ 288-14 FINES § 288-14
283:289
structure, obtain from the permit holder a certification of the asbuilt
elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation, in
relation to mean sea level. The certificate shall be prepared by
or under the direct supervision of a licensed land surveyor or
professional engineer and certified by same. For manufactured
homes, the permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation
upon placement of the structure on the site. A certificate of
elevation must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it
remains on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is
fully licensed and ready for highway use).
(2) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval of
the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies detected
shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project unless
immediately corrected.
E. Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's engineer or
architect shall make periodic inspections at appropriate times
throughout the period of construction in order to monitor compliance
with permit conditions and enable said inspector to certify, if requested,
that the development is in compliance with the requirements of the
floodplain development permit and/or any variance provisions.
F. Stop-work orders.
(1) The local administrator shall issue or cause to be issued, a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found ongoing without a
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 288-9 of this chapter.
(2) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found noncompliant
with the provisions of this chapter and/or the conditions of the
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 288-9 of this chapter.
G. Certificate of compliance.
(1) In areas of special flood hazard, as determined by documents
enumerated in § 288-7, it shall be unlawful to occupy or to permit
the use or occupancy of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate
of compliance has been issued by the local administrator stating
that the building or land conforms to the requirements of this
chapter.
(2) A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the local
administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in
areas of special flood hazard.
§ 288-14 PORT JERVIS CODE § 288-14

Variance Procedure
§ 288-20. Appeals Board.
A. The Zoning Board of Appeals as established by the City of Port Jervis
shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter.
B. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the local administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
C. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals may
appeal such decision to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article 78 of the
Civil Practice Law and Rules.
D. In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter and:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program of that area;
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
(10) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with
conducting search and rescue operations during periods of
flooding;
§ 288-20 FINES § 288-20
283:299
§ 288-21. Conditions for variances.
(11) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
(12) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including search and rescue operations,
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems and streets and bridges.
E. Upon consideration of the factors of § 288-20D and the purposes of this
chapter, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
this chapter.
F. The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions
including technical information and report any variances to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, provided that the items in
§ 288-20 D(1) through (12) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
(1) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure; and
(2) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsection A, D, E and F of this section are met; and
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.
D. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
§ 288-20 PORT JERVIS CODE § 288-21
283:300
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
G. Notification.
(1) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
(a) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance
coverage; and
(b) Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property.
(2) Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance
actions as required in § 288-14H of this chapter.

§ 310-1. Findings; purpose; legislative intent.
A. The Common Council finds that nuisances exist in the City of Port Jervis
in the use or alteration of residential and commercial property which
interfere with the interest of the public and the quality of life and
environment of the community, property values and public health,
safety and welfare of the residents of the City of Port Jervis. Many of
these buildings, structures, erections or places are used in flagrant
violation of the building and housing codes, zoning ordinances, health
laws, and Multiple Residence Law.119 The Common Council further finds
that the continued occurrence of such activities and violations is
detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City.
The Common Council further finds that such public nuisances are often
conducted by habitual offenders.
B. It is the purpose of this chapter to authorize and empower the
authorized officers and officials of the City of Port Jervis to impose
sanctions and penalties for such nuisances and specifically the habitual
offenders who conduct them. Such powers may be exercised either in
conjunction with, in addition to, or apart from the powers contained in
other laws without prejudice to the use of procedures and remedies
available under such other laws. The Common Council further finds that
the sanctions and penalties imposed pursuant to this chapter constitute
an additional and appropriate method of law enforcement in response
to the proliferation of the above-described public nuisances. The
sanctions and penalties contained herein are reasonable and necessary

plumber doing the work, if a registered plumber.
B. Service of notice; time for compliance. Such notice may be served
personally or by mail; and if by mail it may be addressed to such master
plumber at the address registered by him, but the failure of a master
plumber to register will relieve the board which appoints the Plumbing
Inspector from the requirement of giving notice of violation. Unless the
violation is removed within three days after the day of serving or
mailing such notice, exclusive of the day of serving or mailing, the City
may proceed according to law.

FORECLOSED
GENERAL REFERENCES
Dangerous buildings  See Ch. 234.
Property maintenance  See Ch. 417.
Rental property  See Ch. 430.
§ 415-1. Legislative findings and intent.
A. The Common Council of the City of Port Jervis, Orange County, New
York, recognizes that there is a rising number of properties within the
City that have become abandoned, vacant, or boarded up as the result
of the mortgage foreclosure process under New York State law or for
other reasons, including but not limited to the inability of the owner or
owners of such property to make real property tax payments, insurance
payments, property maintenance requirements as established by local,
county, state or federal codes, or for various other reasons. The
Common Council recognizes that buildings, both residential and
commercial, have remained abandoned, vacant or boarded up for long
periods of time, some for many years. As such, these buildings and the
properties upon which they are constructed are unsightly and unsafe
and have a negative effect on their surroundings and upon the
community in general. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a
program for identifying and registering abandoned and vacant
buildings and properties; to determine the responsibility of the owners
or mortgagees of these properties; to set forth the process for securing,
maintaining and rehabilitating these properties and to require the
registration of these properties with the Building Official/Code
Enforcement Officer of the City of Port Jervis.
B. The Common Council of the City of Port Jervis intends that the
provisions of this chapter are to prevent properties that have been
abandoned, are vacant and/or may be involved in the mortgage
foreclosure process from becoming dangerous, blighted, overgrown,
susceptible to vandalism and otherwise nuisances to the public in
general and specifically to surrounding property owners. The Common
Council recognizes that properties involved in the mortgage foreclosure
process in particular are left abandoned, vacant, blighted and locations
that might breed nuisance and criminal activity for months and often
years. Accordingly, the Common Council believes that the provisions of
this chapter requiring registration of properties; posting of properties;
designation of local agents for properties; the securing of properties;
penalties for the failure to comply with the requirements of this chapter
and other ordinances, sanitary codes, building codes, and other local
regulations dealing with the external and internal maintenance of

into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the industrial user and certified to by a qualified
professional.
C. Periodic compliance reports.
(1) Any user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the compliance
date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source,
after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit
to the Director and DEP, during the months of June and December,
unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by
the Director and DEP, a report indicating the nature and
concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such
pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a
record of all daily flows which, during the reporting period,
exceeded the average daily flow reported in § 445-98. At the
discretion of the Director and concurrence of DEP, and in
consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates,
holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Director may agree to alter the
months during which the above reports are to be submitted;
however, no fewer than two reports shall be submitted per year.
(2) The Director with the concurrence of DEP may impose mass
limitations on users, which are using dilution to meet applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where
the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases,
the report required by § 445-106C(1) shall indicate the mass of
pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of
the user. These reports shall contain the results of discharge
sampling and analysis, including the flow, and the nature and
concentration, or production and mass, where requested by the
Director and DEP, of pollutants contained therein, which are
limited by the applicable pretreatment standard. All analyses shall
be performed in accordance with standard methods, by a
laboratory certified by NYSDOH to perform the analyses.
D. Violation report. If sampling performed by the user indicates a violation
of this chapter and/or the user's discharge permit, the user shall notify
the Director and DEP within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and
submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Director and DEP within
30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required
to resample if the POTW performs monitoring of the user's discharge at
least once a month for the parameter that was violated, or if the POTW
performs sampling, for the parameter which was violated, between the
user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this
sampling.

No person shall cause the discharge of slugs to the POTW. Each person
discharging into the POTW greater than 100,000 gallons per day or greater
than 5% of the average daily flow in the POTW, whichever is lesser, shall
install and maintain, on his property and at his expense, a suitable storage
and flow-control facility to insure equalization of flow over a twenty-fourhour
period. The storage and flow-control facility shall have a capacity for at
least 50% of the daily discharge volume and shall be equipped with alarms
and a rate of discharge controller, the regulation of which shall be directed
by the Director. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for
flow equalization upon the same terms set forth elsewhere in this chapter.

Preliminary treatment, and flow equalization facilities, or monitoring
stations, if provided for any wastewater, shall be constructed and
maintained continuously clean, safe, and continuously operational by the
owner at his expense. Where an industrial user has such treatment,
equalization, or monitoring facilities at the time this chapter is enacted,
the Director may approve or disapprove the adequacy of such facilities.
Where the Director disapproves of such facilities and construction of new or
upgraded facilities for treatment, equalization, or monitoring are required,
plans and specifications for such facilities shall be prepared by a licensed
professional engineer and submitted to the Director. Construction of new
or upgraded facilities shall not commence until written approval of the
Director has been obtained.
E. Other reports. The Director may impose reporting requirements
equivalent to the requirements imposed by § 445-106C for users not
subject to pretreatment standards.
A. All significant industrial users, and other industrial users whose
industrial waste discharge has caused or may cause interference or
pass-through, shall install and maintain a suitable monitoring station,
on their premises at their expense, to facilitate the observation,
sampling, and measurement of their industrial wastewater discharge.
B. If there is more than one street lateral serving an industrial user, the
Director may require the installation of a control manhole on each
lateral.
C. The Director may require that such monitoring station(s) include
equipment for the continuous measurement and recording of
wastewater flow rate and for the sampling of the wastewater. Such
station(s) shall be accessibly and safely located, and the industrial user
shall allow immediate access, without prior notice, to the station by the

property taxes due and owing to the City of Port Jervis are collected.

City of Port Jervis, or is located outside the geographical boundaries of
the City of Port Jervis, then the City of Port Jervis attorney is authorized
to seek recovery of charges, including punitive damages, in a court of

ARTICLE II
Utility Services Income Tax
[Adopted 6-15-1942 by L.L. No. 4-1942 (Ch. 142, Art. III of the 1981
Code)]
§ 475-10. Legislative intent. [Amended 6-23-1944 by L.L. No.
3-1944; 6-19-1945 by L.L. No. 1-1945; 6-10-1946 by L.L. No. 2-1946;
6-24-1947 by L.L. No. 3-1947; 5-24-1948 by L.L. No. 4-1948;
6-28-1949 by L.L. No. 1-1949]
By § 20-b of the General City Law, as added by Chapter 321 of the Laws of
1937 and as last amended by Chapter 479 of the Laws of 1945, cities are
authorized to enact local laws imposing a tax such as is imposed by § 186-a
of the Tax Law. Pursuant to such authority, this article is modeled upon said
§ 186-a. It is intended thereby and likewise by this article, enacted pursuant
to the above-mentioned authority, to impose a tax on utility services whether
rendered by utilities in the strict sense or not, and whether such services
are in the main or incidental part of their business and regardless of
whether the public streets are used in any manner. Accordingly, such a
utility is defined for the purpose of the tax as including every person subject
to the supervision of the Department of Public Service and every other
person furnishing utility services. It is intended to include persons and
corporations which are directly in competition with ordinary utilities, such
as landlords and submeterers, who buy their services from other utilities
and in turn resell such services. For that reason the tax is imposed on
receipts from sales to ultimate consumers. Receipts from the sale of such
utility services to submeterers are not taxed, but receipts of submeterers
from their own customers are intended to be taxed. Any other construction
would result in a complete exemption from taxation of utility services sold
or furnished by this particular method. Furthermore, it is believed that
submeterers have common characteristics that distinguish them from other
businesses and justify the conclusion that the method, character and nature
of their business, in this aspect, is substantially similar to the business
of an ordinary utility and requires similar treatment for purposes of the
tax. This conclusion is strongly fortified by the fact that such landlords
and submeterers are in direct competition with ordinary utilities and hence
should bear similar tax burdens in order to avoid inequality of treatment.
§ 475-11. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
GROSS INCOME  Receipts received in or by reason of any sale,
conditional or otherwise (except sales hereinafter referred to with respect
to which it is provided that profits from the sale shall be included in gross
income), made or service rendered for ultimate consumption or use by the
purchaser in the City of Port Jervis, including cash, credits and property
of any kind or nature (whether or not such sale is made or such service
is rendered for profit), without any deduction therefrom on account of the
§ 475-10 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 475-11
470:523
cost of the property sold, the cost of the materials used, labor or services or
other costs, interest or discount paid or any other expense whatsoever; also
profits from the sale of securities; also profits from the sale of real property
growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in such property; also
profits from the sale of personal property (other than property of a kind
which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand
at the close of the period for which a return is made); also receipts from
interest, dividends and royalties derived from sources within the City of
Port Jervis, other than such as are received from a corporation a majority of
whose voting stock is owned by the taxpaying utility, without any deduction
therefrom for any expenses whatsoever incurred in connection with the
receipt thereof, and also profits from any transaction (except sales for resale
and rentals) within the City of Port Jervis whatsoever.
GROSS OPERATING INCOME  Receipts received in or by reason of any
sale, conditional or otherwise, made for ultimate consumption or use by
the purchaser of gas, electricity, steam, water, refrigeration, telephony or
telegraphy, or in or by reason of the furnishing for such consumption or use
of gas, electric, steam, water, refrigerator, telephone or telegraph service
in the City of Port Jervis, including cash, credits and property of any kind
or nature, without any deduction therefrom on account of the cost of the
property sold, the cost of materials used, labor or services or other costs,
interest or discount paid, or any other expenses whatsoever.
PERSONS  Persons, corporations, companies, associations, joint-stock
associations, copartnerships, estates, assignees of rents, any person acting
in a fiduciary capacity or any other entity, and persons, their assignees,
lessees, trustees or receivers appointed by any court whatsoever or by any
other means, except the state, municipalities, political and civil subdivisions
of the state or municipality, and public districts.
UTILITY  Includes every person subject to the supervision of either
division of the State Department of Public Service, except persons engaged
in the business of operating or leasing sleeping and parlor railroad cars
or of operating railroads other than street surface, rapid transit, subway
and elevated railroads, and also includes every person (whether or not
such person is subject to such supervision) who sells gas, electricity, steam,
water, refrigeration, telephony or telegraphy delivered through mains,
pipes or wires, or furnishes gas, electric, steam, water, refrigerator,
telephone or telegraph service by means of mains, pipes or wires,
regardless of whether such activities are the main business of such person
or are only incidental thereto or whether use is made of the public streets.

Pursuant to the authority granted by § 20-b of the General City Law of the
State of New York, a tax equal to 1% of its gross income from and after
July 1, 1937, is hereby imposed upon every utility doing business in the City
§ 475-11 PORT JERVIS CODE § 475-12
470:524
of Port Jervis which is subject to the supervision of the State Department
of Public Service, which has a gross income for the 12 months ending May
31 in excess of $500, except motor carriers or brokers subject to such
supervision under Article 3-b of the Public Service Law, and a tax equal to
1% of its gross operating income is hereby imposed upon every other utility
doing business in the City of Port Jervis which has a gross operating income
for the 12 months ending May 31 in excess of $500, which taxes shall have
application only within the territorial limits of the City of Port Jervis and
shall be in addition to any and all other taxes and fees imposed by any other
provisions of law for the same period. Such taxes shall not be imposed on
any transaction originating or consummated outside the territorial limits
of the City of Port Jervis, notwithstanding that some act be necessarily
performed with respect to such transaction within such limits.
§ 475-13. Records to be kept.
Every utility subject to tax under this article shall keep such records of its
business and in such form as the City Clerk-Treasurer may require, and
such records shall be preserved for a period of three years, except that the
City Clerk-Treasurer may consent to their destruction within that period or
may require that they be kept longer.

6-28-1949 by L.L. No. 1-1949; 6-27-1950 by L.L. No. 4-1950]
Every utility subject to tax hereunder shall file, on or before September
25, December 25, March 25 and June 25, a return for the three calendar
months preceding each such return date, including any period for which
the tax imposed hereby or by any amendment hereof is effective, each of
which returns shall state the gross income or gross operating income for
the period covered by each such return. Returns shall be filed with the City
Clerk-Treasurer on a form to be furnished by him for such purpose and shall
contain such other data, information or matter as the City Clerk-Treasurer
may require to be included therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provision of this section, any utility whose average gross income or average
gross operating income, as the case may be, for the aforesaid three months'
periods is less than one $1,500, may file a return annually on June 25
for the 12 preceding calendar months, and the City Clerk-Treasurer may
require any utility doing business in the City of Port Jervis to file an annual
return, which shall contain any data specified by the City Clerk-Treasurer,
regardless of whether the utility is subject to tax under this article. The City
Clerk-Treasurer, in order to ensure payment of the tax imposed, may require
at any time a further or supplemental return, which shall contain any data
that may be specified by the City Clerk-Treasurer. Every return shall have
annexed thereto an affidavit of the head of the utility making the same, or
of a copartner thereof, or of a principal officer of the corporation, if such
business be conducted by a corporation, to the effect that the statements
contained therein are true.
§ 475-12 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 475-15
470:525
§ 475-15. Payment of tax.
At the time of filing a return as required by this article, each utility shall
pay to the City Clerk-Treasurer the tax imposed by this article for the period
covered by such return. Such tax shall be due and payable at the time of
filing the return or, if a return is not filed when due, on the last day on which
the return is required to be filed.
§ 475-16. Unsatisfactory returns.
In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the City Clerk-Treasurer, and if a corrected or sufficient
return is not filed within 20 days after the same is required by notice
from the City Clerk-Treasurer, or if no return is made for any period, the
City Clerk-Treasurer shall determine the amount of tax due from such
information as he is able to obtain, and, if necessary, may estimate the tax
on the basis of external indices or otherwise. The City Clerk-Treasurer shall
give notice of such determination to the person liable for such tax. Such
determination shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax, unless the person
against whom it is assessed shall, within 30 days after the giving of notice
of such determination, apply to the City Clerk-Treasurer for a hearing, or
unless the City Clerk-Treasurer, of his own motion, shall reduce the same.
After such hearing, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall give notice of his decision
to the person liable for the tax. The decision of the City Clerk-Treasurer may
be reviewed by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and
Rules of the State of New York if application therefor is made within 30 days
after the giving of notice of such decision. An order to review such decision
shall not be granted unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed,
with interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the
City Clerk-Treasurer and an undertaking filed with him, in such amount
and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve, to
the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the
applicant will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution
of such proceeding, or, at the option of the applicant, such undertaking may
be in a sum sufficient to cover the tax, interest, penalties, costs and charges
aforesaid, in which event the applicant shall not be required to pay such
tax, interest and penalties as a condition precedent to the granting of such
order.
§ 475-17. Notification procedure.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may
be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended, in a
postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address given by him
in the last return filed by him under this article, or, if no return has been
filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to
whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the
provisions of this article by the giving of notice shall commence to run from
the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 475-15 PORT JERVIS CODE § 475-18
470:526
§ 475-18. Penalties for noncompliance; remission.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return or to pay any tax or
any portion thereof within the time required by this article shall be subject
to a penalty of 5% of the amount of the tax due, plus 1% of such tax for
each month of delay or fraction thereof, excepting the first month, after
such return was required to be filed or such tax became due; but the City
Clerk-Treasurer, if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or
any portion of such penalty.
§ 475-19. Refunding procedure.
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer thereof
shall make application for a refund thereof and the City Clerk-Treasurer or
the court shall determine that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof was
erroneously or illegally collected, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall refund the
amount so determined. For like cause and within the same period, a refund
may be so made on the initiative of the City Clerk-Treasurer. However, no
refund shall be made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination
of the City Clerk-Treasurer as hereinbefore provided unless the City Clerk-
Treasurer, after a hearing as hereinbefore provided or of his own motion,
shall have reduced the tax or penalty or it shall have been established
in a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of
the State of New York that such determination was erroneous or illegal.
All refunds shall be made out of moneys collected under this article. An
application for a refund, made as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an
application for the revision of any tax or penalty complained of and the City
Clerk-Treasurer may receive additional evidence with respect thereto. After
making his determination, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall give notice thereof
to the person interested, and he shall be entitled to an order to review such
determination under said Article 78, subject to the provisions hereinbefore
contained relating to the granting of such an order.
§ 475-20. Tax as part of operating costs of utility.
The tax imposed by this article shall be charged against and be paid by the
utility and shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by the
utility to customers or others but shall constitute a part of the operating
costs of such utility.
§ 475-21. Failure to pay.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this
article, the Corporation Counsel shall, upon the request of the City Clerk-
Treasurer, bring an action to enforce payment of the same. The proceeds of
any judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to the City Clerk-
Treasurer. Each such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the
person liable to pay the same, in the same manner and to the same extent
that the tax and penalty imposed by § 186-a of the Tax Law is made a lien.
§ 475-18 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 475-22
470:527
§ 475-22. Powers of City Clerk-Treasurer.
In the administration of this article, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall have
power to make such reasonable rules and regulations, not inconsistent with
law, as may be necessary for the exercise of his powers and the performance
of his duties, and to prescribe the form of blanks, reports and other records

charge in satisfaction of such charge; provided, however, that the court
must impose at least the minimum fine as authorized in this section for
the offense.

§ 520-1. Purpose and legislative intent.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed the City of Port Jervis's
authority concerning the placement, construction and modification of
wireless telecommunications facilities. The City Board finds that wireless
telecommunications facilities and related equipment may pose a unique
hazard to the health, safety, public welfare and environment of the City
and its inhabitants and may also have an adverse visual impact on the
community, its character and thus the quality of life in the City. The intent of
this chapter is to ensure that the placement, construction or modification of
wireless telecommunications facilities and related equipment is consistent
with the City's land use policies and Zoning Code to minimize the negative
and adverse visual impact of wireless telecommunications facilities; to
assure a comprehensive review of environmental impacts of such facilities;
to protect the health, safety and welfare of the City of Port Jervis; and
to encourage shared use of wireless telecommunications facilities. These
regulations are not intended to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting
the provision of personal wireless services nor shall they be used to
unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent
services consistent with current federal regulations.

Facilities Siting Law for the City of Port Jervis," or may otherwise be known

A. Findings. The Common Council of the City of Port Jervis is familiar with
the City, the location of adult-oriented business within the City and the
issues raised by such business in the City and throughout the country.
Based on the Council's local knowledge, the input of City residents and
business owners obtained during a public meeting held on _________,
2004, and evidence and studies concerning the impacts or "secondary
effects" of adult-oriented businesses on the surrounding community, as
presented in judicial decisions such as, but not limited to, City of Erie v.
Pap's A.M. tdba "Kandyland," 529 U.S. 277 (2000); Barnes v. Glen
Theater, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters,
Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theaters, Inc., 427
U.S. 50 (1976); Stringfellow's of New York. Ltd, v. City of New York, 671
N.Y.S.2d 406 (1998); Town of Islip v. Caviglia, 73 N.Y. 2d 544 (1989); and
Singer v. Town of East Hartford, 736 F.Supp. 430 (D. Conn. 1989), aff'd
901 F.2d 297 (2d Cir. 1990) (affirming judgment on basis of District
Court opinion), and on studies conducted by other communities,
including but not limited to New York City, New York (1994); Seattle,
Washington (1993); Seattle, Washington (1989); Village of Scotia, New
York (1999); Town and Village of Ellicotville, New York (1998); Town of
Islip, New York (1980); and Indianapolis, Indiana (1984), and from
publications such as "Report to the American Center for Law and
§ 535-12 PORT JERVIS CODE § 535-13
520:714
Justice on the Secondary Impacts of Sex Oriented Businesses,"
produced by Peter Hecht, Ph.D. of the Environmental Research Group,
and "Adult Uses and the First Amendment: Zoning and Non-Zoning
Controls on the Use of Land for Adult Businesses," by Steve McMillen
of Pace University Law School, and also on the findings from the Report
of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually
Oriented Businesses (1989, State of Minnesota), the Council finds that:
(1) Adult-oriented businesses are unavoidably associated with
unlawful, unhealthy and detrimental activities ancillary to the
constitutionally protected speech activities of such businesses.
(2) Employees of adult-oriented businesses engage in or may be
requested to engage in sexual behavior as a result of the type of
business by which they are employed.
(3) People present in the vicinity of an adult-oriented business are
often assumed by third parties to be engaged in, or amenable to,
the types of unlawful, unhealthy and detrimental activities ancillary
to such businesses. As a result, such persons are subjected to
unwanted advances or attention by persons frequenting such adultoriented
business.
(4) People who choose not to frequent adult-oriented businesses tend
to avoid areas in which such businesses locate. As a result, areas in
which adult-oriented businesses locate often become "dead zones,"
i.e., areas in which owners of non-adult-oriented businesses tend to
choose not to locate in the first instance, or choose to migrate away
from, because of diminished pedestrian traffic due to the presence
of adult-oriented businesses.
(5) Because non-adult-oriented businesses tend not to locate near, or
migrate away from, adult-oriented businesses, the presence of one
such business tends to attract other adult-oriented businesses into
the dead zone, thereby increasing the pace and intensity of the
unlawful, unhealthy and detrimental activities unavoidably
associated with such businesses and contributing to the blighting
of the area surrounding such businesses. The smaller the
municipality, including the City, the larger the effects of a dead
zone because the zone encompasses a larger proportion of the
municipality's businesses than a similar zone would in a larger City.
(6) Due to the small geographical area of the City of Port Jervis, the
probability increases that adult-oriented businesses will have
substantial effects upon residential areas within the City. Further,
smaller municipalities, including the City, are more likely to have
fewer days and hours of commercial activity than a larger City. This
increases the likelihood that an adult-oriented business will have a
larger effect on the area in which it is located during the off hours
of non-adult-oriented businesses.
§ 535-13 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 535-13
520:715
(7) Sexual acts, including masturbation, occur at adult-oriented
businesses, especially those which provide enclosed rooms, booths
or other cubicles for viewing of films, videos or live sex shows,
thereby creating unhealthy and unsanitary conditions within the
premises of such businesses.
(8) The constitutionally protected speech activities presented at adultoriented
businesses often encourages sexual activities, thereby
creating unhealthy and unsanitary conditions.
(9) Some patrons frequent adult-oriented businesses for the purpose of
engaging in specified sexual activities within the premises of such
businesses, thereby creating unhealthy and unsanitary conditions
within the premises of such businesses.
(10) Communicable diseases may be spread by specified sexual
activities, including but not limited to transmission of the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the contraction of the acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), Hepatitis B and venereal
diseases.
(11) Venereal diseases, HIV, AIDS and Hepatitis B, as well as other
communicable diseases spread by specified sexual activities, are
serious health concerns in the local community.
(12) Sanitary conditions in some adult-oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are
unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the
activities engaged in by some patrons of such businesses and the
failure of some business owners and operators to self-regulate
those activities and maintain the business premises.
(13) Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen and
other bodily fluids are found in certain areas of adult-oriented
businesses, particularly where persons view, in enclosed rooms,
booths or other cubicles, adult materials or entertainments
characterized by an emphasis on nudity or specified sexual
activities or specified anatomical areas.
(14) Prohibiting the viewing, in enclosed rooms, booths or other
cubicles, of adult materials or entertainments characterized by an
emphasis on nudity or specified sexual activities or specified
anatomical areas is the least restrictive means available
effectuating the legitimate and content-neutral legislative goal of
preventing adult-oriented businesses from being operated and
used in a unhealthy, unsafe and unsanitary manner facilitating the
transmission of communicable diseases or otherwise degrading the
public welfare, health, comfort and safety. Further, such a
prohibition imposes a relatively minor imposition on the operating
prerogatives of the owners of adult-oriented businesses compared
to other means such as: mandating adult-oriented businesses
inspect such cubicles and directing the frequency and form of such
§ 535-13 PORT JERVIS CODE § 535-13
520:716
inspections, requiring adult-oriented businesses to hire employees
whose duties are dedicated to monitoring such cubicles and
conducting increased numbers of police and public health and
safety inspections of such businesses.
(15) Adult-oriented businesses have operational characteristics which
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect the substantial
governmental concerns raised by the various findings herein while
permitting patrons and owners of such businesses to engage in
constitutionally protected speech activities.
(16) The presence of adult-oriented businesses is associated with
declining property values.
(17) The presence of adult-oriented businesses is associated with
increased crime rates against both property and persons.
(18) Children and teenagers are more likely to be exposed to graphic
sexual images because of the presence of adult-oriented
businesses.
(19) Because persons patronizing adult-oriented businesses often travel
a significant distance to such businesses, these persons tend not to
share with City residents the concerns for the quality of life in the
City. Consequently, persons from outside the City patronizing such
businesses tend to place an inordinate strain on City services and
facilities, such as parking, usage of City streets, and trash
collection and removal.
(20) The presence of adult-oriented businesses tends to alter the
character of the community in which they are located and quality of
life for the residents of such community. The City is presently in the
process of undergoing a transformation altering both the character
and quality of life in the City. The alterations to character and
quality of life associated with the presence of adult-oriented
businesses are at odds with the goals of the transformation the City
is undergoing, and, consequently, the failure to properly regulate
adult-oriented businesses could undermine this process.
(21) The City's intent in regulating adult-oriented businesses is not to
restrict constitutionally protected speech activities but rather to
provide constitutionally sufficient alternate avenues for persons to
engage in such activities in a manner consistent with the
constitutions of the United States and New York State while
addressing the unlawful, unhealthy and detrimental activities
ancillary to such speech and ameliorating these secondary effects
on the peace, good order, commercial viability and safety of City
residents and non-adult-oriented businesses.
(22) The general welfare, health, comfort and safety of the citizens of
the City will be promoted by the enactment of this section.
§ 535-13 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 535-13
520:717

neighborhoods and business and maintain the viability of the
City's ongoing process of transformation;

A. Purpose.
(1) The City of Port Jervis hereby finds and declares that there is a
need in the City of Port Jervis for housing developments located and
designated to meet the special needs and habits of adults 55 years
of age and older. Such housing can contribute to the dignity,
independence and meaningful activity of our active adults.
(2) The City of Port Jervis has determined that an appropriate means to
fulfill these needs is to establish senior citizen affordable housing
(SCAH) by zoning amendment, consisting of housing for adults over
the age of 55 years that may or may not be directly supported or
subsidized by a governmental agency, in accordance with the
particular criteria established herein.
(3) The purpose of the Senior Citizen Affordable Housing District
(SCAH) is to enable the City of Port Jervis to permit, on a case-bycase
basis, housing that satisfies the need for such developments in
locations where it will not detract from surrounding land uses. Any
use, other than the uses specifically enumerated herein, shall be
prohibited in a Senior Citizen Affordable Housing District (SCAH).
B. Zoning. The SCAH option shall be available anywhere within the City of
Port Jervis.
C. Application procedure.
(1) Application for the establishment of a Senior Citizen Affordable
Housing District shall be made to the Common Council. Such
application shall include a sketch plan of the property on which the
§ 535-33 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 535-34
520:739
district is to be located, including approximate location of proposed
buildings and other structures, parking areas, pedestrian
circulation, roads, open space, recreation areas and other proposed
facilities.
(2) Once the Common Council has, in its sole discretion, accepted an
application for a Senior Citizen Affordable Housing Floating
District and has approved the same for a particular property, the
applicant shall apply to the Planning Board for site plan approval in
accordance with procedures set forth in this chapter for said plan
approval.193 If a period of more than one year elapses between the
Common Council's approval of the SCAH District and the
submission of a site plan application, the SCAH District designation
shall lapse, and the property shall revert to its prior zoning
classification.
(3) In addition to all other customary fees, a fee as provided in Chapter
280, Fees, shall accompany an application for Senior Citizen
Affordable Housing District. In addition, the applicant shall pay
reasonable expenses incurred by the City in review of said
application and shall deposit in an escrow account with the City
necessary funds to cover fees for technical assistance to the City,
such as, but not limited to, City Planner and City Attorney.194
D. Development standards.
(1) It shall be the duty of the owner or his agent to file a certification
with the Building Official indicating a compliance with this
section's requirements relating to the number of occupants and the
age of the occupants in each dwelling unit. Such certification shall
be filled no later than January 15 of each year. Failure to file
certification as required shall be deemed a violation of this section
subject to penalties set forth in § 535-75 of this chapter.
(2) No dwelling unit shall contain more than one bedroom.
(3) The occupancy of senior citizen affordable housing shall be limited
to two persons who qualify as senior citizens under present, future
or amended definitions of the governmental agency providing
subsidiary or support to the project (Federal Department of
Housing and Urban Development, New York State Division of
Housing and Community Renewal or similar or successor agencies
of the federal or state government) or to families the head of which
so qualifies. The occupancy of a dwelling unit by a family the head
of which is younger than a senior citizen shall be permitted if it is
established that the presence of such person is essential for
physical care of an eligible occupant. In the absence of any
definition, the minimum age for eligibility shall be 55 years.

(4) Within the senior citizen district, certain related ancillary facilities
may be permitted, either in a separate building or in combination
with dwelling units, such as cafeterias, self-service laundries,
lounges, game rooms or workshops, to the extent that they meet
the needs of the occupants of the development. Such facilities shall
be subordinate to the residential character of the development and
shall be located out of public view with no outside advertising. Such
facilities shall be approved by the Planning Board. Approval of a
conditional use and site development plan for dwelling units in a
senior citizen affordable housing development in no way
constitutes approval for installation of any type of related facility.
(5) Bulk standards.
(a) The gross site density shall not exceed 24 dwelling units per
acre.
(b) The maximum building height shall be 35 feet or 2 1/2 stories,

bedroom shall be 700 square feet.
(f) Lot coverage shall not exceed 35%.
(g) The Common Council, upon the recommendation of the
Planning Board, may authorize the Planning Board to modify
those sections of this chapter relative to lot dimensions,
building setbacks, and density in the site plan of properties
when necessary to comply with the provisions in this section
and to promote the intent of this section.
(6) Suitably equipped and adequately maintained recreation and open
space shall be provided. Group sitting areas shall be well defined
by walls, fences, hedges or other plantings designated to impart a
sense of containment and/or security and to provide group privacy.
(7) There shall be provided a safe and convenient system of drives,
service access road and walks with due consideration given in
planning such facilities to such items as handrails and ramps. Such
facilities shall be adequately lighted, and said lighting shall not be
directed on adjacent streets or properties.
(8) Central refuse collection areas shall be located for the convenience
of all units. There shall be supplied an adequate number and type of
covered receptacles and these shall be provided with proper
screening and maintenance.
§ 535-34 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 535-34
520:741
(9) Where a dwelling unit is to be rented, the lease for said unit shall
not exceed two years. As long as an occupant remains eligible and
has complied with the terms of the lease, the occupant shall be
offered a two-year renewal of the lease. If an occupant's annual
income shall exceed the eligible income level by more than 20%,
and there is an eligible applicant for the unit, the occupant may
complete the then-current lease term only.
(10) Occupant selection standards. The following standards shall be
used to determine occupancy:
(a) Veterans of the United States Armed Forces 55 years of age or
older.
(b) Households whose head of household and spouse are 55 years
of age or older.
(c) Households whose head of household or spouse is 55 years of

be restricted so that, in the event of resale by the owner or any
successor, the project shall remain as affordable senior citizen
housing for a period of 30 years from the date of the original
certificate of occupancy.
(b) Rental. The title to a development containing affordable senior
citizen housing rental units shall be restricted so that, in the
event of resale by the owner, the purchaser shall be obligated
to maintain the provisions of the rent regulation agreements in
accordance with Subsection D(9) and (12) of this section.
(12) Rent regulation and lease renewal; continued eligibility. An
occupant of a senior citizen affordable housing rental unit remains
eligible for the renewal of a lease if the occupant's aggregate
income at the time of the lease renewal does not exceed four times
the current rental ceiling rate for the occupant's unit or as
described or set forth by state and/or federal law.
(13) Improvements restriction. The owner of an affordable senior
citizen housing unit shall not make any internal or external
structural improvements and/or changes to a unit without first
obtaining the appropriate approvals and permits necessary.
(14) Parking requirements: 0.5 per dwelling unit. Parking spaces,
except for handicapped, shall be nine feet by 18 feet.

affordable housing development approved in accordance with these
regulations shall remain valid for a period of two years following the
approval of the site plan by the Planning Board and all other necessary
§ 535-34 PORT JERVIS CODE § 535-34
520:742
§ 535-35. Supplementary regulations applying to Mountain
Residence District only.
governmental approvals as shall be needed to start construction. If, at
the end of that two-year period, no application for a building permit has
been filed, then the plan shall be considered as having lapsed and shall
be of no effect. However, one two-year extension may be granted by
the Planning Board for the site plan if the developer shows reasonable
grounds for delay in the start of construction. Further, once a building
permit is issued, if a substantial portion of the construction anticipated
under said building permit authorization is not commenced within one
year of the issuance of the permit, the permit shall be void ab initio.
A. Purposes. It is the intent of the City of Port Jervis to achieve on the
several large, undeveloped parcels of land remaining within the City
limits a quality of design and development which:
(1) Permits flexibility of design and development in such a way as to
promote superior land planning and greater economy, efficiency
and convenience in the arrangement of land uses and their
supporting infrastructure, facilitate adequate and economic
provision of streets and utilities, preserve open space and the
natural and scenic qualities of open lands, protect floodplains and
other natural features, and otherwise encourage the most
appropriate use of land.
(2) Promotes a development in harmony with the objectives of the
City's Comprehensive Plan.195
B. Kinds of dwelling units permitted. Single-family homes (either detached
or attached) and multifamily dwellings shall be permitted (preferably in
combination) within the Mountain Residence District. In the case of
attached and/or multifamily structures, no more than five dwelling units
shall be accommodated within any one structure.
C. Development standards and controls. Except as specified herein, all
development standards and controls normally applicable to other
residential subdivisions and uses shall also be applicable to Mountain
Residence District development. Nothing contained in this chapter shall
relieve the owner or the owner's agent or the developer of a proposed
Mountain Residence District development from receiving subdivision
plat approval in accordance with the City Subdivision Regulations. In
approving the final plat for a Mountain Residence District development,
the Planning Board may modify the acreage requirement for recreation
areas of the City Subdivision Regulations, provided that the common
land dedicated in Subsection C(6) of this section meets all other
requirements of the City Subdivision Regulations.
195. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 535-34 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 535-35
520:743
(1) Density. The maximum number of dwelling units that may be
permitted shall be determined in the following manner:
(a) Compute total site acreage from a survey of the property
prepared by a licensed surveyor.
(b) Deduct from the gross acreage [Subsection C(1)(a) above] the
acreage represented by lands under water, within a floodway,
within a New York State designated wetland, within easements
or rights-of-way for overhead or underground utilities, with
slopes (unexcavated) of over 20% (as based on a two-foot
contour survey prepared by a licensed surveyor) or within a
designated street line of any road.
(c) Multiply the net acreage [Subsection C(1)(b) above] by 10. The
resulting whole number (unrounded) represents the maximum
number of dwelling units that will be permitted on the site.
(2) Minimum lot size. To allow for maximum flexibility in design and
land use, no minimum lot size shall be required in the R-3 District.
(3) Frontage. The site must have a minimum street frontage of 100 feet
and two means of access for more than 15 dwelling units, and
access to the parcel must not create any traffic hazards.
(4) Maximum coverage. The permitted gross building coverage on any
Mountain Residence District development site shall not exceed
20% of the gross land area.
(5) Setbacks, screening and buffering of the site's surrounding
property. In reviewing the site plan, the Planning Board shall
consider the setback and proposed screening of parking and active
recreation areas from adjacent property lines and may require
setbacks up to twice the normally applicable setback requirement
for one-family dwellings in the nearest zoning district to which the
Mountain Residence District development is located. Buffer and
screening areas shall be landscaped, left in their natural state, or
provided with additional evergreen foliage as required by the
Planning Board.
(6) Open space and recreation areas. At least 30% of the gross acreage
of any development shall be composed of land which is used for
recreation purposes and/or preserved as open space.
(7) Layout design considerations.
(a) Environmentally sensitive land. The Planning Board will seek
the preservation of steep slopes, wetlands, floodplains, water
bodies, and other environmentally sensitive or unique open
space or natural features.
(b) In large-scale subdivisions, the Planning Board shall consider
the layout of small residential groupings within the
§ 535-35 PORT JERVIS CODE § 535-35
520:744
development, each having some open space immediately
surrounding it, as a goal of proper site planning so that a large,
massive concentration of units, with little or no differentiation,
can be avoided, and so that the character of the development
will match the character of the neighborhood in which it is
located.
(c) In each development, a pedestrian circulation system shall be
designed and installed, in addition to the vehicular circulation
system, which is sufficient for the needs of residents. Such a
system may be composed of a combination of paved and
unpaved walkways and bikeways of appropriate width, design,
and location to serve their intended function.
(8) Utilities and services.
(a) The development must be served by central water supply and
central sewage treatment systems as approved by the
appropriate governmental agency or agencies having
jurisdiction thereof.
(b) Roof-mounted cooling systems shall be completely screened
from view.
(c) Surface water retention facilities shall be developed so that the
rate of stormwater runoff after construction is no greater than
the rate of runoff prior to development.
(d) On-site lighting shall be directed downward and shall not
reflect on adjacent properties.
(9) Energy efficiency. The plan for development shall be designed and
arranged in such a way as to promote energy efficiency and assure
solar access for a majority of all dwelling units and any closely
situated structures on adjacent parcels.
(10) Fire protection. Adequate water supply and pressure must be
available on site to meet the fire-fighting requirements for the
largest proposed units on the site, to the satisfaction of the
Planning Board.
(11) Open space, homeowners' association or deed restrictions. In the
event that the application of this procedure results in a plat
showing lands available for park, recreation, open space, or other
municipal purposes directly related to the plat, then the Planning
Board as a condition of plat approval may establish such conditions
on the ownership, use and maintenance of such lands as it deems
necessary to assure the preservation of such lands for their
intended purposes. Legal documents for such ownership, use and
maintenance, such as documents for a homeowners' association,
deed restrictions, covenants or park districts, shall be approved by
the City Attorney.
§ 535-35 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 535-35
520:745
D. Conservation areas.
(1) General. Conservation areas may include wetland areas,
floodplains, steep slopes, or other open space areas having
meaningful scenic, ecological, environmental and/or recreational
characteristics, with such access, shape, size, and location as
determined appropriate by the Planning Board to satisfy the
intended purpose, but shall not include parking areas or roads.
(2) Continued preservation. The permanent preservation of such open
space areas shall be legally assured to the satisfaction of the
Planning Board and City Attorney by the filing of appropriate
covenants, deed restrictions, easements, or other agreements,
unless:
(a) The Common Council agrees in its discretion to accept the
dedication of all or any part of such areas; or
(b) All or part of such areas is to be transferred to a conservation
organization which is dedicated to the permanent preservation
of open spaces and is approved by the Common Council.
(3) Ownership of conserved land areas. The ownership of conserved
land areas shall be divided equally or proportionately among all
owners of building lots or units within the development, except
where all or an appropriate portion of the conserved land area is
deeded to a recognized conservation organization dedicated to the
preservation of open space and such dedication is acceptable to the
conservation organization and the Planning Board, or offered for
dedication to the City of Port Jervis, and the Common Council has
voted to accept such offer. Except in those cases where the
ownership of the conserved land areas is to be vested in the City or
an approved conservation organization, the developer shall execute
and file with the Common Council such documents as will be
sufficient to create a home or property owners' association
responsible for the conserved land areas in accordance with the
requirements of Subsections E and F below.
E. Organization. A Mountain Residence District development shall be
organization as one of the following:
(1) A home or property owners' association approved by the Common
Council upon recommendation of the City Attorney and the New
York State Attorney General;
(2) An organization akin to a condominium or a cooperative approved
by the New York State Attorney General and the Common Council;
(3) A funded community trust approved by the Common Council upon
recommendation of the City Attorney; or
§ 535-35 PORT JERVIS CODE § 535-35
520:746
(4) A special multipurpose taxing district approved by the Common
Council upon recommendation of the City Attorney.
F. Home or property owners' association. Whenever a home or property
owners' association is proposed, the Common Council shall retain the
right to review and approve the articles of incorporation and charter of
said association and to require whatever conditions it deems necessary
to ensure that the interest and purpose of this chapter are carried out.
In consideration of said approval, the Common Council shall, in part,
require the Mountain Residence District development to meet the
following conditions:
(1) The association shall be established as an incorporated, not-forprofit
organization operating under recorded land agreements
through which each lot owner (and any succeeding owner) is
automatically subject to a charge for a proportionate share of the
expenses for the organization's activities.
(2) Title to all common property shall be placed in the association, or
definite and acceptable assurance shall be given that it
automatically will be so placed when 50% of the units are sold, said
common property to be subject to a development easement granted
to the City for the purpose of guaranteeing its perpetuity as open
space.
(3) Each lot owner shall have equal voting rights in the association and
shall have the right to the use and enjoyment of the common
property.
(4) Once established, all responsibility for operation and maintenance
of the common land and facilities shall lie with the association.
(5) Dedication of all common areas shall be recorded directly on the
subdivision plat, or by reference on the plat to a dedication in a
separately recorded document. Resubdivision of such areas is
prohibited. The dedication shall:
(a) Save the title to the common property to the association free of
any cloud of implied public dedication;
(b) Commit the developer to convey the areas to the association at
an approved time;
(c) Grant easements of enjoyment over the area to dwelling unit/
lot owners; and
(d) Give to it the right to suspend membership rights for
nonpayments of assessments or infractions of published rules.
(6) Covenants shall be established limiting all dwelling units to onefamily
use and all common lands to open space uses. No structures
may be erected on such common lands except as approved by the
§ 535-35 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 535-35
520:747
Planning Board in accordance with the provisions of § 535-61 of
this chapter.
(7) Each deed to each dwelling unit/lot sold shall include by reference
all recorded declarations, such as covenants, dedications and other
restrictions (including assessments and the provision for liens for
nonpayment of such).
(8) The association shall be perpetual and shall purchase insurance,
pay taxes, specify in its charter and bylaws an annual homeowner's
fee and provision for assessments, and establish that all such
charges become a lien on each property in favor of said association.
The association shall have the right to proceed in accordance with
all necessary legal action for the foreclosure and enforcement of
liens, and it shall also have the right to commence action against
any member for the collection of any unpaid assessment in any
court of competent jurisdiction.
(9) The developer shall assume all responsibilities as previously
outlined for the association until a majority of the dwelling sites are
sold, at which time the association shall be operated by an elected
board of directors whose members shall come from the association.
(10) As a condition of site plan approval, the developer shall file with the
Common Council a performance bond (or cash equivalent to the
cost of completion) to insure the proper installation of all
recreation and park improvements shown on the site plan and a
maintenance bond for all common land until the association is
established. The amount and period of said bonds shall be
determined by the Planning Board, and their form, sufficiency,
manner of execution, and surety shall be approved by the Common
Council upon recommendation of the City Attorney.
(11) Adjustment of assessments. The association shall have the power to
adjust assessments to meet changing needs.
(12) Recourse. In the event that the maintenance, preservation, and/or
use of the conserved land area(s) ceases to be in compliance with
any of the above requirements or any other requirements specified
by the Planning Board when approving the subdivision plat, the
City shall be granted the right to take all necessary action to assure
such compliance and to assess against the association and/or each
individual property owner within the development all costs
incurred by the City for such purposes.
(13) Permitted uses in conservation areas.
(a) Except where otherwise approved by the Planning Board,
conserved land areas shall be preserved in their natural state
and the use of such areas shall be limited to appropriate
conservation, open space, and recreation purposes as
determined by the Planning Board. A portion of the conserved

land area(s) may be designated "active recreation area" on the
plat, in a location approved by the Planning Board. Such active
recreation area shall not exceed 10% of the total area of the
proposed plat.
(b) Within such active recreation area, structures and facilities for
active recreational purposes, including playground equipment,
swimming pools, tennis courts, and so forth, may be
constructed and operated for the use of the property owners in
the related development and their guests. Where determined
appropriate, the Planning Board may specify a phased
construction schedule for such structures and facilities, or the
proposed establishment of such new structures and facilities
not shown on the filed plat shall be subject to site plan approval
procedures as set forth in § 535-61 of this chapter.
A. Requirements for in-ground and aboveground pools. Any private
swimming pool shall not be located, constructed or maintained on any
lot or land area except in conformity with the following requirements:
(1) Such pool shall be located in the rear yard only.
(2) If the water for such pool is supplied from a private well, there shall

minimum construction requirements of the Building Department of
the City of Port Jervis and unless the Building Official, or a licensed
professional engineer of New York State, shall have certified that
the drainage of such pool is adequate and will not interfere with the
public water supply system, with existing sanitary facilities, or with
the public streets.
(6) No loudspeaker or amplifying device shall be permitted which can
be heard beyond the lot lines of the lot on which said pool is
located.
(7) No lighting or spotlighting shall be permitted which will project
light rays beyond the lot lines of the lot on which said pool is
located.

ARTICLE XI
Off-Street Parking, Driveways and Loading Facilities
§ 535-45. Off-street parking and loading.
Parking and loading spaces shall be provided off the street for any use of
land, buildings and other structures as specified in this article. Required
off-street parking and loading spaces shall be permanently maintained and
made available for occupancy in connection with and for the full duration
of the use. If any existing use is changed to a use for which additional offstreet
parking or loading spaces are required to comply with this article,
the additional spaces shall be provided for the use in accordance with the
standards of this article. Plans for all such off-street parking and loading
spaces shall be submitted to the Planning Board for its review and approval.
§ 535-46. Supplementary parking regulations in all districts.
Off-street parking spaces, open or enclosed, are permitted accessory to any
use, subject to the following provisions:
A. Parking requirements. Accessory off-street parking spaces, open or
enclosed, shall be provided for any use as specified herein. Any land
which is developed as a unit under single ownership and control shall
be considered a single lot for the purpose of these parking regulations.
Reasonable and appropriate off-street parking requirements for
structures and uses which do not fall within the categories listed herein
shall be determined by the Planning Board upon consideration of all
factors entering into the parking needs of each such use.
B. Areas computed as parking spaces. Areas which may be computed as
open or enclosed off-street parking spaces include any private garage,
carport, or other area available for parking, other than a street or a
driveway. However, other than on that portion of a corner lot which is
subject to the provisions of § 535-23, a driveway within a required front
yard for a one- or two-family residence may count as one parking space.
C. Size of spaces. Each parking space shall be a minimum of nine feet wide
by 18 feet deep and shall be served by an aisle not less than 24 feet
wide. Where parking is arranged back-to-back, each parking space may
share a common backup space. Entrance and exit lanes shall not be
computed as parking space, except for driveways in one- and two-family
residences, as set forth above.203
D. Identification. Each parking space shall be identified with two painted
lines (white or yellow traffic paint), four inches wide, set seven feet
apart and placed one foot in from each side. These lines shall extend for
20 feet in length.
203. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 535-45 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 535-46
520:771
E. Prohibited parking areas. Parking shall not be permitted between the
street line and the front elevation of the principal building in all
residential districts. Parking shall not be permitted anywhere in the
front yard of any dwelling, except that where the Planning Board finds
that due to unique conditions compliance with this limitation will cause
practical difficulties and tend to increase on-street parking by
residents, the Planning Board may authorize parking anywhere in the
front yard of such dwelling except for that portion thereof which is
directly in front of the principal building, exclusive of garage
structures.
F. Access. Unobstructed access to and from a street shall be provided.
Such access shall consist of at least one twelve-foot-wide lane for
parking areas with fewer than 20 spaces and at least two twelve-footwide
lanes for parking areas with 20 spaces or more. No entrance or
exit for any off-street parking area with a capacity of more than four
spaces shall be located within 50 feet of any street intersection nor
exceed a grade in excess of 6% within 25 feet of any street line or 10%
at any other point.
G. Drainage and surfacing. All parking areas shall be properly drained and
all such areas, except for parking spaces accessory to a one- or twofamily
dwelling, shall be provided with a dustless surface in accordance
with specifications of the City of Port Jervis. The maximum slope of a
parking area shall not exceed 5%.
H. Joint facilities. Required parking spaces, open or enclosed, may be
provided in spaces designed to serve jointly two or more
establishments, whether or not located on the same lot, provided that
the number of required spaces in such joint facilities shall not be less
than the total required for all such establishments.
I. Combined spaces. When any lot contains two or more uses having
different parking requirements, the parking requirements for each use
shall apply to the full extent. Where it can be conclusively demonstrated
that one or more such uses will be generating a demand for parking
spaces primarily during periods when the other use or uses is not or are
not in operation, the Planning Board may reduce the total parking
requirement to an amount which, in its judgment, will prevent frequent
parking on the street by persons working on, or visiting, the premises.
J. Enclosed facilities. Required parking areas may be constructed within
or under any portion of a main building, provided that the access
driveway does not at any point have a grade in excess of 10%.
K. Location and ownership. Required accessory parking spaces, open or
enclosed, shall be provided upon the same lot as the use to which they
are accessory or elsewhere, provided that no required spaces are
located farther than 200 feet walking distance from such lot. In all such
cases, the parking spaces shall conform to all the regulations of the
district in which the parking spaces are located, and in no event shall

residence districts or upon approval by the Planning Board. Such
spaces shall be in the same ownership as the use to which they are
accessory and shall be subject to deed restrictions, approved by the
Planning Board, binding the owner and the owner's heirs and assigns to
maintain the required number of spaces available either throughout the
existence of the use to which they are accessory or until such spaces
are provided elsewhere, in a location and manner acceptable to the
Planning Board.
L. Lots divided by district boundaries. When a parking lot is located partly
in one district and partly in another district, the regulations for the
district requiring the greater number of parking spaces shall apply to
the entire lot. Parking spaces on such lot may be located without regard
to district lines, provided that no such parking spaces shall be located
in any residential district unless either the use to which they are
accessory is permitted in such district or upon approval by the Planning
Board.
M. Landscaping. All open parking areas shall be suitable landscaped. In
parking lots with more than 20 spaces, at least 5% of the area of the

Off-street loading berths, open or enclosed, are permitted as accessory
to any use (except one- or two-family dwellings) subject to the following
provisions:
A. Loading requirements. Accessory off-street loading berths shall be
provided for any use specified herein. Any land which is developed as a
unit under single ownership and control shall be considered a single lot
for the purpose of these loading requirements. Reasonable and
appropriate off-street loading requirements for structures and uses
which do not fall within the categories listed shall be determined by the
Planning Board upon consideration of all factors entering into the
loading needs of each such use.
(1) For a public library, museum, or governmental building, hospital or
sanitarium, nursing or convalescent home, residential health care
facility, adult care facility, or school: if floor area does not exceed
10,000 square feet, one berth; and for each additional 25,000
square feet or fraction thereof, one additional berth.
(2) For buildings with professional, governmental, or business offices
or research, design and development laboratory: if floor area is less
than 8,000 square feet, none; if floor area amounts to between
8,000 and 25,000 square feet, one berth; for each additional 25,000

additional berth; and for each 50,000 square feet or major fraction
thereof, one additional berth.
(3) For retail sales establishments and trade shops: if floor area is less
than 8,000 square feet, none; if floor area amounts to between
8,000 and 25,000 square feet, one berth; and if floor area exceeds

520:775
§ 535-49. Parking regulations for multiple dwellings.

berth shall be at least 12 feet wide, 35 feet long, and 15 feet high.
C. Location and access. Unobstructed access, at least 12 feet wide, to and
from a street shall be provided. Such access may be combined with
access to a parking lot. All permitted or required loading berths shall be
on the same lot as the use to which they are accessory, except as
provided above. No entrance or exit for any loading area shall be
located within 50 feet of any street intersection. All loading berths shall
meet the minimum setback requirements and shall be screened where
visible from any residential district boundary.
D. Joint facilities. Permitted or required loading berths, open or enclosed,
may be provided in spaces designated to serve jointly two or more
adjacent establishments, provided that the number of required berths
in such joint facilities shall not be less than the aggregate of all such
requirements.
E. Lots divided by district boundaries. When a lot is located partly in one
district and partly in another district, the regulations for the district
requiring the greater number of loading berths shall apply to the entire
lot. Loading berths on such lot may be located without regard to district
lines, provided that no such berths shall be in any residence district,
unless either the use to which they are accessory is permitted in such
district or upon approval by the Planning Board.
A. Pavement markings. Wherever space is provided for the parking of five
or more vehicles in the open, such spaces shall be individually identified
by means of pavement markings.
B. Proximity to windows. The parking of motor vehicles is prohibited

dwelling, which wall contains windows (other than bathroom or kitchen
windows) with a sill height of less than eight feet above the level of said
parking space.
C. No motor vehicle services to be rendered. No service of any kind shall

lot is used for any use prohibited in the district in which such driveway is
located. No driveway shall provide access to a lot located in a nonresidential
district, across land in a residential district.
§ 535-52. Trailers and boats.
A. Abutting. Wherever a parking area of over five spaces is within 15 feet
of the side or rear lot lines of a lot in any residence district, said parking
lot shall be thoroughly screened from such adjoining lot, subject to
approval by the Planning Board. Generally such screening shall be eight
feet in height and, if composed of plants, shall not be less than three
feet in height, capable of reaching eight feet in height at maturity.

persons is hereby prohibited in all districts, except that:
(1) One camping trailer not over 20 feet in length, whether or not
mounted on wheels, may be stored, but not used for any purpose,

trailer is not stored within any required setback, nor between the
street line and the principal building.
(2) Where a building permit has been issued for the construction or

ARTICLE XII
Nonconforming Uses and Noncomplying Buildings
§ 535-55. Nonconforming uses.
The following provisions shall apply to all buildings and uses existing on
the effective date of this chapter which do not conform to the requirements
set forth in this chapter and to all buildings and uses that become
nonconforming by reason of any subsequent amendment to this chapter.
Any nonconforming use of buildings or open land may be continued
indefinitely but:
A. Shall not be enlarged, altered, extended, reconstructed, or restored
(except as provided below), or placed on a different portion of the lot or
parcel of land occupied by such use on the effective date of the chapter,
if such enlargement, alteration, extension, reconstruction or
restoration exceeds 25% of the area of the use. Such permitted
expansion is not intended to nullify or make inapplicable any bulk
requirements otherwise required by this chapter. The above-referenced
twenty-five-percent expansion is intended to permit only a one-time
expansion and shall not be interpreted to permit cumulative expansions
which would exceed 25% of the original area of use.
B. Shall not be moved to another location where such use would be
nonconforming.
C. Shall be allowed to be changed to another nonconforming use provided
that it is of the same or of a more restricted nature or lesser density in
terms of traffic, noise, odor or other impact on neighborhood character
as determined by the Building Official.
D. Shall not be reestablished if such use has been discontinued by reason
of vacancy for any reason or no reason at all for a continuous period of
240 days or more or has been changed to, or replaced by, a conforming
use. If vacancy is caused by the loss of a certificate of occupancy due to
unaddressed and uncorrected building and zoning code violations, the
time of such vacancy shall count toward the two-hundred-forty-day
period in this Code section. Furthermore, in any building or property
having multiple dwelling units, occupancy of only one or fewer dwelling
units and vacancy in the remaining units shall be deemed a vacancy for
the purposes of this Code section. Intent to resume a nonconforming
use shall not confer the right to do so. Such time period shall apply to
properties whose nonconforming use was discontinued after the
enactment of this statute. Properties whose nonconforming use was
discontinued prior to the enactment of this statute shall not reestablish
or resume the nonconforming use after a period of one year. The
Building Official of the City of Port Jervis must send a notice to the
owner of the real property advising the owner of the Code sections that
exist relating to potential loss of use and discontinuance, the date of
potential loss of use or discontinuance, the proof that is required, and
the ability to appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals after a
§ 535-55 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 535-55
520:779
determination by the Building Official. The Building Official or Deputy
Building Official may direct that water service be denied or terminated
at any time at a property where the certificate of occupancy for that
property/structure has been revoked or denied for a violation of any
local, county, state or federal statute or regulation. [Amended
5-28-2013 by L.L. No. 4-2013; 3-28-2016 by L.L. No. 8-2016;
4-25-2016 by L.L. No. 10-2016]
E. Restoration and reconstruction.
(1) Shall not be restored for other than a conforming use after damage
for any reason exceeding 75% of its assessed value or its bulk (such
determination to be made solely by the City Assessor). If the
restoration of a building whose damage does not exceed 75% of its
assessed value or of its bulk is not commenced and substantially
completed within a one-year period, the nonconforming use of such
building shall be deemed to have been discontinued.
(2) Where a catastrophic fire or disaster has occurred and a structure/
building housing a nonconforming use has been demolished by
direction of officials of the City of Port Jervis or has been voluntarily
demolished by the property owner in order to protect the health
and safety of the citizens of Port Jervis and adjacent properties, the
Port Jervis Common Council may permit the reconstruction of a
structure/building on the site of the demolished structure/building
and may authorize continuation of the nonconforming use after
conducting a public hearing on the question of whether or not to
grant said waiver. [Added 10-27-2008 by L.L. No. 4-2008]
(3) Once the Common Council has agreed to permit the reconstruction
of a structure/building on the site of a demolished structure/
building and/or continuation of the nonconforming use housed in
that structure/building, a site redevelopment plan must be
submitted to and approved by the Planning Board of the City of Port
Jervis prior to the issuance of a building permit or certificate of
occupancy/compliance. The site development plan rules and
regulations set forth in § 535-61 of this Code must be adhered to.
[Added 3-23-2009 by L.L. No. 2-2009]
F. Removal of additional kitchens or kitchenettes in nonconforming
dwellings. If any nonconforming multiple dwelling or two-family
detached dwelling as such items are defined in the Port Jervis City Code
shall, as result of noncompliance with any subsections of § 535-55, lose
its use or uses as a multiple dwelling or two-family detached dwelling,
then in addition to not reestablishing such nonconforming use, such
dwellings shall have removed, prior to the reoccupancy of the entire
premises, all additional kitchens or kitchenettes that were previously
permissible when the allowable nonconforming use existed. Removal
shall include, but not be limited to, the removal of all structures and
appliances for the cooking or preparation of food as well as all plumbing
and gas lines feeding said kitchen or kitchenette back to their source of
§ 535-55 PORT JERVIS CODE § 535-55

§ 535-56. Noncomplying buildings.
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent normal maintenance
and repair, structural alteration in, or the reconstruction of a noncomplying
building, provided that such action does not increase the degree of
nonconformity by more than 25% or create any new nonconformity with
regard to the regulations pertaining to such buildings.

origin, multiple gas manifolds to a single manifold and meter, multiple
electrical meters and boxes to a single box, and wall openings allowing
for a through way in the interior of the structure. No nonconforming
multiple dwelling or two-family detached dwelling that shall lose its use
or uses as a multiple dwelling or two-family detached dwelling shall be
able to establish a new use, including a use as a single-family dwelling,
without a full inspection by the Code Enforcement Officer to confirm
removal of all additional kitchens or kitchenettes. [Added 5-28-2013
by L.L. No. 5-2013; amended 8-28-2018 by L.L. No. 7-2018]
A. Residential buildings or structures. Any existing one- or two- or
multiple-family residential building or structure, or building accessory
thereto, made noncomplying as to bulk by this chapter or any
amendment thereof shall be permitted to comply with the yard and
setback requirements as specified for the highest residential district
having the same or less lot width. In no event, however, shall the yard
and setback requirements of any be less than the requirements for the
R-2 Zone. No front setback may, in any event, be closer to the
designated street line than the existing established setback.
B. Nonresidential buildings and structures. Normal maintenance and
repair of, structural alteration in, or reconstruction of a building or
structure with noncomplying bulk is permitted if the same does not
increase the degree of noncomplying bulk in such building or structure
by more than the above-referenced 25%, in such building or structure.
C. Adjoining lots. Two or more adjoining nonconforming subdivision lots,
regardless of ownership, in a subdivision approved by the Planning
Board shall have three years from the date of filing with the office of the
County Clerk to obtain a building permit. Any noncomplying lot in a
subdivision approved by the Planning Board and filed with the office of
the County Clerk more than three years prior to the effective date of
this chapter and in the same ownership shall not be eligible to receive a
building permit. Said subdivision or part thereof shall be resubmitted to
the Planning Board for approval in accordance with the applicable
provisions of this chapter. Any lot in a subdivision approved by the
Planning Board after the effective date of this chapter but which is
made nonconforming as to bulk by any future amendments of this
chapter shall have three years from the date of filing to obtain a
building permit.

§ 535-58. Termination of nonconforming uses.
Each of the nonconforming uses specified in this section is deemed
sufficiently objectionable, undesirable, and out of character in the district in
which such use is located as to depreciate the value of other property and
uses permitted in the district and blight the proper and orderly development
and general welfare of such district and the community, to a point that each
such nonconforming use must be, and shall be, terminated on or before
the expiration of the specified period of time after the effective date of this
chapter, which period of time is specified for the purpose of permitting the
amortization of the remaining value, if any, of such use:
§ 535-59. Required modification of nonconforming uses.
Each of the nonconforming uses specified in this section is deemed
sufficiently objectionable, undesirable, and out of character in the district
in which such use is located as to depreciate the value of other property
and uses permitted in such district and blight the proper and orderly
development and general welfare of such district and the City, to a point
requiring that each of such nonconforming uses be modified to the extent
possible within a specified period of time as set forth below:
D. Noncomplying lots. A residential lot separated from any other land in
the same ownership and noncomplying as to bulk, whether or not
located in and part of a subdivision plat approved by the Planning Board
and filed in the office of the County Clerk, and which has a minimum lot
width of 60 feet, may be used for a one-family detached residence,
provided that such use shall comply with the bulk requirements as
specified in the highest residential district having the same or less lot
width.
A. Open land. In any residence district, any nonconforming use of open
land, including but not limited to such uses as a parking lot, mobile
home, junkyard, or open storage yard for materials or equipment, may
be continued for three years after the effective date of this chapter,
provided that, after the expiration of that period, such nonconforming
use shall be terminated.
B. Sign. Any sign not of a type permitted, or of a permitted type but of a
size exceeding the maximum permitted size by more than 10%, may be
continued for one year following the effective date of this chapter,
provided that, after the expiration of that period, such nonconforming
use shall be terminated. Any sign that is now nonconforming by reason
of a previous chapter shall be terminated upon the adoption of this
chapter.
A. Open land. In any residence district, any nonconforming use of open
land, including such uses as parking lots, junkyards, fuel tanks, or open
storage yards for material or equipment, regardless of the presence of
any building thereon, may be continued as is for one year after the
enactment of this chapter, during which time the Building Official shall
§ 535-57 PORT JERVIS CODE § 535-59
520:782
§ 535-60. Repairs and maintenance.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing regulations, nothing in this article
shall be deemed to prevent normal maintenance and repair of any use or
building, or the carrying out upon the issuance of a building permit of major
structural alterations or demolitions necessary in the interest of public
safety. In granting such a building permit, the Building Official shall state
the precise reason why such alterations were deemed necessary.
notify each property owner that the use of such property is to be
terminated, unless within 60 days the owner applies to the Planning
Board for a conditional use permit. On or before the expiration of
said one-year period such nonconforming use shall be modified in
accordance with such reasonable conditions as shall be imposed by the
Planning Board when issuing a conditional use permit, which conditions
shall be designed to minimize any detrimental effect that such use of
open land may have on adjoining or nearby lots in a residence district.
B. Building not fully enclosed. In any district, other than as residence
district, any use which is nonconforming because it is not located within
a building fully enclosed on all sides may be continued for three years
after the effective date of this chapter, provided that, after the
expiration of that period, such nonconforming use shall be terminated.
Any other provision to the contrary notwithstanding, however, no such
use will be required to terminate if, within said period, such use shall be
located within a completely enclosed building complying with the
requirements of the district in which it is located or if, within said
period, such use shall be surrounded with a solid fence, of material and
design acceptable to the Planning Board, which fence shall be one foot
higher than any material stored outdoors, provided that such fence
shall be maintained in good condition at all times.

ARTICLE XIII
Planning Board
§ 535-61. Site development plan rules and regulations.
A. Authorization. Pursuant to General City Law, in all cases where this
chapter requires authorization and approval of site development plans
by the Planning Board or Building Official, no building permit and/or
certificate of occupancy/compliance shall be issued by the Building
Official except upon authorization of and in conformity with the plans
approved by the Planning Board or Building Official as hereinafter
provided.
B. Applicability.
(1) No site development plan approval shall be required for singlefamily
detached residential uses or for additions, alterations or
structures accessory thereto. All other principal uses, conditional
uses and expansions of nonconforming or noncomplying uses shall
require a site plan approval prior to the issuance of a building
permit or certificate of occupancy/compliance. No lot or parcel of
land shall be used except in conformity with an approved site
development plan, when required.
(2) Site plans for all permitted uses or uses permitted by right, and
expansions thereof, or changes of use which do not require a
variance or conditional use permit, or expansions of nonconforming
or noncomplying uses which do not require a variance and are
allowed in this chapter, shall be reviewed and approved by the
Building Official.
(3) Site plans for all conditional uses, or uses which require a variance,
shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning Board.
(4) Any approvals by the Building Official given pursuant to this
section shall be reported to the Planning Board at the next
regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning Board.
C. Application fee. All applications made to the Planning Board or Building
Official shall be in writing on forms prescribed by the Planning Board or
Building Official and shall be accompanied by a fee as determined by
the fee schedule of the City of Port Jervis.
(1) A site plan requiring Planning Board approval shall be submitted to
the Planning Board Secretary at least 14 days prior to the Planning
Board meeting at which review is sought. Of the 15 copies
required, the Building Official shall retain one copy and send two
copies to the Director of Public Works.
(2) A site plan requiring Building Official approval shall be submitted
to the Building Official with four copies.
§ 535-61 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 535-61
520:785
D. Sketch plan. For purposes of an initial informal submission, the
applicant should provide a sketch plan with as much information as may
be required by the Planning Board to determine basic conformance
with applicable regulations and to determine the exact nature of
SEQRA review required. The sketch plan review by the Planning Board
shall not constitute a formal review, and no approval can be granted
based on it. At this time, the applicant should outline any modifications
he/she is requesting from the requirements specified herein. In the
event that a conditional use approval is required, or that a draft
environmental impact statement will be required to be submitted, the
Planning Board shall simultaneously consider all applications and
documents.
E. Preliminary approval. If a particular application is, in the opinion of the
Planning Board, of sufficient complexity to warrant review in stages,
the Planning Board may defer the submission of certain required
detailed engineering work at time of public hearing, rendering a
preliminary decision on the basis of a less than complete submission
and a final decision only on the basis of a complete submission (similar
to the review of a major subdivision according to the City Subdivision
Regulations).
F. Materials to be submitted. The following information must be submitted
to the Planning Board or Building Official for site plan approval, unless
items are specifically waived by the Planning Board or Building Official

Building Official shall take into consideration the public health, safety
and general welfare and the comfort and convenience of the public in
general and of the prospective occupants of the proposed development
and residents of the immediate neighborhood in particular and may
attach reasonable conditions and safeguards as a precondition to its
approval. The Board shall consider the special conditions set forth for
any use requiring Planning Board authorization in Article XIV and the
following general objectives:
§ 535-61 PORT JERVIS CODE § 535-61
520:788
(1) Traffic access. All proposed traffic accessways are adequate but not
excessive in number; adequate in width, grade, alignment and
visibility; not located too near street corners or other major access
points or places of public assembly; located on a roadway capable
of adequately and safely handling the additional traffic; and will
provide for other similar safety considerations.
(2) Circulation and parking. Adequate off-street parking and loading
spaces are provided to prevent parking in public streets of the
vehicles of any persons connected with or visiting the use and the
interior circulation system is adequate to provide safe accessibility
to all required off-street parking.
(3) Landscaping and screening. All recreation areas, parking and
service areas are reasonably screened at all seasons of the year
from the view of adjacent residential lots and streets and the
general landscaping of the site is in character with that generally
prevailing in the neighborhood. As approved by the Planning Board
or the Building Official, any such required landscaping and
screening shall be bonded, as provided for elsewhere in this
chapter. Existing trees over 12 inches in caliper should be
preserved to the maximum extent possible. Roadside plantings
shall be in conformance with the requirements of the City
Department of Public Works.204
(4) Character and appearance. The character and appearance of the
proposed use, buildings, and/or outdoor signs will be in general
harmony with the character and appearance of the surrounding
neighborhood and that of the City of Port Jervis and will not
adversely affect the general welfare of the inhabitants of the City of
Port Jervis, such determination to be made by the City's Design
Review Board. Signs and lights will be compatible and in scale with
building elements and will not represent significant impact on the
environment or result in a waste of the land and other natural
resources of the City. To the greatest possible extent, development
will be in harmony with the natural environment, and adequate
mitigating measures will be taken to offset potential significant
deterioration resulting from the project. Signs shall conform to
size, shape, color, materials and location as called for by the
Planning Board, the Design Review Board and/or the Building
Department.
(5) Development. The site development plan elements, including
buildings, parking, drainage, circulation, signs and lighting, will
not adversely affect the potential of adjacent properties or the
property under review from its highest and best use.
204. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 535-61 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 535-61
520:789
(6) Fire and police protection. All proposed structures, equipment or
material shall be readily accessible for fire and police protection.
(7) Harmony. The proposed use shall be in such location, size and
character that, in general, it will be in harmony with the
appropriate and orderly development of the district in which it is
proposed to be situated and will not be detrimental to the orderly
development of adjacent properties in accordance with the zoning
classification of such properties.
(8) In or adjacent to residence district. In addition to the above, in the
case of any use located in, or directly adjacent to, a residence
district:
(a) The location and size of such use, the nature and intensity of
operations involved in or conducted in connection therewith,
its site layout and its relation to access streets shall be such
that both pedestrian and vehicular traffic to and from the use
and the assembly of persons in connection therewith will not
be hazardous or inconvenient to, or incongruous with, said
residence district or conflict with the normal traffic of the
neighborhood; and
(b) The location and height of buildings, the location, nature and
height of walls and fences, and the nature and extent of
landscaping on the site shall be such that the use will not
hinder or discourage the appropriate development and use of
adjacent land and buildings or impair the value thereof.
(9) Environmental consideration. The proposed use shall not have a
significant adverse environmental impact as defined by the New
York State Environmental Quality Act. In the event that any aspect
of the proposed use might have a significant environmental impact,
the Planning Board shall require either a special report of limited
scope, or a draft environmental impact statement of enlarged
scope, addressing the background information, the anticipated
impact(s), and the proposed mitigation measures.
(10) Dumpster enclosure and screening requirements. If a person or
commercial establishment as defined in Chapter 457 of the Code
uses or maintains a dumpster the following requirements for
enclosure or screening shall apply: [Added 10-28-2013 by L.L.
No. 8-2013]
(a) The enclosure shall provide complete visual screening.
(b) The enclosure shall be compatible in color with the principal
structure on the lot.
(c) The enclosure shall be a three-sided masonry or concrete
enclosure, six feet in height with a solid, swing-open gate, door
or fence made from a suitable material. The gate, door or fence
§ 535-61 PORT JERVIS CODE § 535-61
520:790
shall be equipped with an appropriate mechanism for holding
the doors open only during garbage pickup operation and shall
close securely.
(d) The enclosure and/or screening shall be kept in good repair or
condition and all garbage, refuse, rubbish or waste shall be
kept only within the container and permit the lids on said
container to remain completely closed at all times.
(e) The Planning Board may also require a roof if the site is sloped
and adjoining neighbors are at a higher elevation, making the
containers visible.
(f) Any other requirements with respect to dumpsters or solid
waste as defined in Chapter 457 of the Code shall also apply.
H. Public hearing. The Planning Board shall not authorize any use
requiring approval of plans by the Planning Board without first holding
a public hearing. Notice of the hearing and the substance of the
application shall be given by publication in the official newspaper of the
City at least 10 days before the date of such hearing. In addition to such
published notice, the applicant shall cause notice to be given of the
substance of the application together with notice of the hearing thereon
by causing notices thereof to be mailed (certified mail, return receipt
requested) at least 10 days before the date of the hearing to the owners
of the property abutting that of the applicant and all other owners of
property within 300 feet, or such additional distance as the Planning
Board may deem advisable, from the exterior boundaries of the land
involved in such application, as the names of said owners appear on the
last completed assessment roll of the City. At the discretion of the
Planning Board, the Secretary of the Planning Board or the applicant
shall furnish proof of compliance with the notification procedure, all
costs required and fees assessed by the Secretary of the Planning Board
to be borne by the applicant. Any or all of the notices required by this
section shall be issued by the Secretary of the Planning Board on order
of the Planning Board or upon order of the Chairperson of the Board if
the application is received when the Board is not in session and the
Chairperson deems it necessary or desirable to expedite the public
hearing on such application. Provided that due notice shall have been
published as above provided and that there shall have been substantial
compliance with the remaining provisions of this section, the failure to
give notice in exact conformance herewith shall not be deemed to
invalidate any action taken by the Planning Board. This same public
hearing may serve the purposes of SEQRA, the contents of the draft
environmental impact statement (if required) also being the proper
subject of public comment.
I. Notification of adjacent municipality. If the land involved in any
application lies within 500 feet of the boundary of any other
municipality, the City Clerk-Treasurer shall also transmit to the
municipal clerk of such other municipality a copy of the official notice of
§ 535-61 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 535-61
520:791
public hearing thereon not later than the day after such notice appears
in the official newspaper of the City.
J. Referral to county. Should any proposed site plan approval, conditional
use approval, or special permit consist of or include any of the following
conditions, the Planning Board shall notify the City Clerk-Treasurer,
who shall, prior to final action by said Board, refer the proposal to the
Orange County Planning Department in accordance with §§ 239-1 and
239-m of Article 12-B of the General Municipal Law on the form titled
"County Zoning Referral."
(1) Any site development plan involving real property lying within a
distance of 500 feet from:
(a) The boundary of any village or town.
(b) The boundary of any state park or other recreation area.
(c) The right-of-way of any county or state parkway, thruway,
expressway, or other controlled access highway.
(d) The right-of-way of any stream or drainage channel owned by
the county or for which the county has established channel
lines.
(e) The boundary of any county- or state-owned land on which a
public institution is located.
K. Action on application. Within 62 days after the date of such hearing, the
Planning Board shall approve with or without modification or
disapprove such site plan, and the grounds of a modification, if any, or
the grounds for disapproval shall be stated upon the records of the
Planning Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the time in
which the Planning Board must take action on such site plan may be
extended by mutual consent of the applicant and the Planning Board.
When so approving a site plan, the Planning Board shall state in writing
such revisions, if any, as it deems necessary to be made prior to
submission of the site plan in final form for signature by the
Chairperson. An approval of a site development plan by the Planning
Board shall expire unless a building permit is secured within six months
of the approval and unless actual construction is begun within nine
months of the approval. The decision of the Planning Board shall be
certified by the Chairperson of the Planning Board and filed in the office
of the City Clerk-Treasurer and a copy thereof mailed to the
applicant.205
L. Improvements. The Planning Board shall require that on- or off-site
improvements be installed, including but not limited to on- or off-site
drainage systems to ensure that all drainage, storm runoff and
205. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 535-61 PORT JERVIS CODE § 535-61
520:792
subsurface water are carried into approved watercourses and drainage
systems shown on the Official Map. The Planning Board shall further
require that all such off-site improvements and/or drainage systems be
installed on property granted to the City by fee, easement or otherwise,
as determined by the Planning Board.
(1) No certificate of occupancy/compliance shall be issued for the site
until all the improvements shown on the site development plan,
including off-site requirements required by the site development
plan, have been duly installed and all easements and property
interests granted or dedicated to the City.
(2) A partial certificate of occupancy/compliance for a period of 90
days, but not more than one year in the aggregate, for a building,
structure or part thereof may be issued before all the on-site
improvements are complete; provided, nonetheless, that such
portion or portions of the site improvements as are necessary to
permit the site to be occupied safely without endangering life or
the public welfare have been completed. The Building Official shall
require a cash deposit to insure and guarantee the completion of
the on-site improvements. The Building Official or the Planning
Board's professional consultants shall determine the sum of such
cash deposit.
M. Field changes. The site shall be developed in strict conformity with the
approved site development plan, except as provided for below. When
the approval of a minor field change is requested of the Building Official
or other appropriate City agency, such request shall be submitted to the
appropriate inspecting agency in writing. No field change shall be valid
unless a copy of the requested change is filed with the Planning Board
or Building Official, with the approval of the appropriate agency noted
thereon or appended thereto, within five days of such approval. Such
change shall be deemed acceptable if not acted upon by the Planning
Board within 45 days or Building Official within five days.
N. Signing of plan.
(1) Upon submission of the final site development plan with
modifications required by the Planning Board or Building Official in
its final approval and upon satisfaction of any conditions imposed
by such approval, the Chairperson of the Planning Board or
Building Official shall sign the approved site development plan and
file one copy with the Building Official, who may thereafter issue a
building permit or certificate of occupancy/compliance in reliance
thereon.
(2) After approval is granted, with or without conditions, to any site
plan the applicant or his representative shall present the plan to
the Planning Board for signature of the Planning Board
Chairperson within 60 days after the vote granting approval or
conditional approval. If the plan is not presented in final approved
§ 535-61 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 535-61
520:793
§ 535-62. Stated policy relative to the Central Business and Service
Commercial Districts.
form within said 60 days, the site plan approval shall be deemed
null and void.
O. Renewal of permit. The Board may require that its approval be
periodically renewed. Such renewal shall be granted and may be
withheld only upon a determination by the Building Official to the effect
that such conditions as may have been prescribed by the Board in
conjunction with the issuance of the original permit have not been, or
are being no longer, complied with. In such cases, a period of 60 days
shall be granted the applicant for full compliance prior to the
revocation of said permit. Any use authorized by the Planning Board
shall be deemed to be a conforming use in the district in which such is
located, provided that:
(1) The provision in this chapter under which such permit was issued is
still in effect;
(2) Such permit was issued in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter; and
(3) Such permit shall be deemed to affect only the lot or portion
thereof for which such permit shall have been granted.
P. Maintenance. It shall be the duty of every property owner to maintain
his/her property in conformity with the approved site development plan.
Failure to do so may constitute a violation of this chapter, resulting in
civil or criminal penalties, forfeiture of bonds, suspension of
consideration of all applications before the Planning Board relating to
the same property, and other remedies deemed necessary by the
appropriate authorities.
Q. Expansion of existing structure subsequent to site plan review and
approval. Any principal or accessory structure incorporated within a
site plan approved by the Planning Board and granted a special use
permit under the provisions of this section subsequently may be
expanded by not more than 15% of its ground floor area in square feet,
upon the granting of a duly issued building permit. Enlargement of any
such structure by more than 15% of its ground floor area in square feet
requires approval by the Planning Board acting upon a new application
under the full provisions of the section.
A. Policy. Relative to the Central Business and Service Commercial
Districts, it is the stated policy of the City of Port Jervis to:
(1) Achieve a dynamic mix of higher-density uses that will generate a
high level of mutually beneficial interrelationships between the
business community and its clients/customers and within the
business community itself.
§ 535-61 PORT JERVIS CODE § 535-62
520:794
(2) Provide an ample supply of decent housing for those who would
most benefit from being able to walk to places of employment and
to places providing goods and services, thus enriching the vitality
of the area through a strong resident population.
(3) Achieve a reasonable pedestrian scale (with circulation assisted by
sidewalks, malls, bridges, elevated walkways, mini parks, etc.) that
encourages walking between two or more places of business and
that encourages lingering and relaxing out-of-doors as weather
permits.
(4) Provide an adequate supply of short- and long-term municipal and
private parking to serve customers, merchants, employees,
residents, tourists, and commuters.
(5) Generate a sufficient tax base that will support a high level of
public services and amenities
B. Effectuation. In order to effectuate this policy, the Planning Board, in
performing site plan reviews and in issuing conditional use permits,
shall be guided by the following considerations:
(1) Multistory, multi-use structures. The scale of operation of the
Central Business and Service Commercial Districts requires an
optimum high density of usage for each and every property located
therein. In order to support the higher costs of traffic control and
parking facilities, pedestrian circulation, street furniture and
lighting, and police and fire protection, multistoried and, wherever
appropriate, multi-use structures should be encouraged, but not
required.
(2) Accessory residential uses. In addition to owner/caretakeroccupied
residences accessory to principal uses this chapter
encourages residential apartments on the second floor and above
in multistoried, multi-use structures. To achieve this intention, the
Planning Board shall:
(a) Discourage any single-storied structures.
(b) Permit no dwelling units on the first (or ground) floor.
(c) Require off-street parking to be provided at the standard of one
parking space per dwelling unit.
(d) Require usable open space (exterior) and common lounge/
recreation area (interior) to be provided for all structures
containing three or more dwelling units.
(e) Require the provision of an enclosed refuse collection area.
(f) Require the provision of a centralized coin-operated facility, if
laundry facilities (washer and dryer) are not provided within

ARTICLE XIV
Conditional Use Standards
§ 535-63. Authorization of conditional uses.
On application, and after public notice and hearing, the Planning Board may
authorize the issuance by the Building Official of permits for any of the
conditional uses for which this chapter requires such permits, in the district
in which such use is proposed to be located. In approving any such use, the
Planning Board shall take into consideration the public health, safety, and
welfare and the comfort and convenience of the public in general and of the
residents of the immediate neighborhood in particular and may prescribe
such appropriate conditions and safeguards as may be required in order
that the result of its action shall, to the maximum extent possible, further
the expressed intent of this chapter.
A. Conditional use rules and regulations. The procedure for obtaining a
conditional use permit shall be identical to that of site development
plans and shall be conducted concurrently where applicable. The
Planning Board may, at its discretion, waive any of the rules or
regulations it considers not pertinent to conditional use approval.
B. Conforming use. Any use for which a conditional use permit may be
required shall be deemed to be a conforming use in the district in which
such use is located, except as provided below, provided that such
permit shall affect only the lot or portion thereof for which such permit
shall have been granted.
C. Nonconforming use of open land. In its review of the nonconforming
use of open land, the Planning Board may impose only such reasonable
conditions, including but not limited to the placing of fencing and
screening, as will minimize the impact such open use has upon
surrounding residential properties. In such cases the Planning Board
may also permit reasonable changes in existing structures on the land,
within the limitations of the district in which said use is located, for the
purpose of reducing the nonconforming open use of the land.
D. Periodic renewal. The Planning Board may require that conditional use
permits be periodically renewed. Such renewal shall be granted
following a due public notice and hearing and may be withheld only
upon a determination by the Planning Board to the effect that such
conditions as may have been prescribed by the Planning Board in
conjunction with the issuance of the original permit have not been, or
are being no longer, complied with. In such cases a period of 60 days
shall be granted the applicant for full compliance prior to the
revocation of said permit. The sixty-day time period for full compliance
only applies for the first violation. If any subsequent violation occurs the
conditional use permit will be revoked.
§ 535-63 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 535-64
520:799
§ 535-64. General requirements.
Prior to approving any conditional use, the Planning Board shall determine
the conformity of such use and the proposed development therefor with
the conditions and standards as set forth in this chapter, including the
conditions and standards as set forth for site development plans. Conditions
prerequisite to approval of such uses are of a general and specific nature.
In various provisions of this chapter, specific standards are enumerated for
certain uses, which standards shall be the minimum conditions for such use.
The general conditions and standards for conditional use approval are as
follows:
A. Harmony. The proposed use shall be of such location, size and character
that it will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development
of the district in which it is proposed to be situated and shall not be
detrimental to the site or adjacent properties in accordance with the
zoning classification of such properties.
B. Traffic. The location and size of such use, the nature and intensity of
operations involved in or conducted in connection therewith, its site
layout, and its relation to access streets shall be such that both
pedestrian and vehicular traffic to and from the use and the assembly of
persons in connection therewith will not be hazardous.
C. Adjacent land and buildings. The location and height of buildings, the
location, nature and height of walls and fences, and the nature and
extent of landscaping on the site shall be such that the use will not
hinder or discourage the development and use of adjacent land and
buildings.
D. Fire and police protection. All proposed structures, equipment, or
material shall be readily accessible for fire and police protection.
E. Public facilities and services required. The proposed use will not
require such additional public facilities or services or create fiscal
burdens upon the City greater than those which characterize uses
permitted by right.
F. Inspection. As a condition of all conditional use permits, right of entry
for inspection with reasonable notice shall be provided for to determine
compliance with the conditions of said permit.
G. Time limitation for completion. As a condition of all conditional use
permits, a time limitation for completion of proposed plans may be
imposed.
H. Additional standards. In addition to the general standards for
conditional use permits as set forth above, the approving board may, as
a condition of approval of any such use, establish any other additional
standards, conditions and requirements, including a limitation on hours
of operation, as it may deem necessary or appropriate to promote the

that the site is capable of supporting without causing adverse effects to
the resources of the City:
(1) The maximum number of dwelling units that may be approved in a
development of multiple dwellings shall be computed by dividing
the usable area in acres of the site by the sum of the lot area
requirements for all dwelling units, based on habitable rooms in
each dwelling unit, as provided in Subsection C(3) below.
(2) The usable area of the site shall not include those portions of the
site that are occupied by water bodies, wetlands, floodplains, high
tides, slopes in excess of 20%, rights-of-way of existing public or
private roads, and utility easements that would prevent use or

ARTICLE XVI
Design Review Board
§ 535-76. Findings and purpose.
The Common Council hereby finds that excessive uniformity, dissimilarity,
inappropriateness, or poor quality of design in the exterior appearance of
buildings erected in any neighborhood adversely affects the desirability of
the immediate area and neighboring areas for residential, business, or other
purposes and by so doing impairs the stability and value of both improved
and unimproved real property in such areas, prevents the most appropriate
development and use of such areas, contributes to the degeneration of
property in such areas with attendant deterioration of conditions affecting
the health, safety, and general welfare of the community, and contributes to
the diminution of the taxable value of real property in such areas and its
ability to support the municipal services provided therefor. It is the purpose
of this article to prevent these and other harmful effects of such exterior
appearance of buildings erected or altered in any neighborhood and thus to
promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the community, conserve
the value of buildings, and encourage the most appropriate use of land
within the City of Port Jervis.
§ 535-77. Composition.
The Planning Board of the City of Port Jervis shall act as the Design Review
Board for the purposes of this chapter.
§ 535-78. Meetings, records, rules and regulations.
Meetings of the Design Review Board may be held concurrently with, or
separately from, the regular meetings of the Planning Board. A majority of
said Board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The
Design Review Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings. All reports,
recommendations or decisions made by the Board must have the approval
of the majority of the Board and shall be officially filed with the City
Clerk-Treasurer. All meetings of the Board shall be open to the public.
Applicants before the Design Review Board shall provide a full set of plans
and accompanying data for its use and permanent file. The applicant shall
not take any action prior to receiving a decision from the Design Review
Board. The Design Review Board must take action within 45 days of the
date of any referral to the Board of a completed application as required
in § 535-79. The applicant may be requested to appear to review with the
Board any submission to it. The Design Review Board shall have the power
from time to time to adopt, amend and repeal rules and regulations not
inconsistent with this chapter.
§ 535-79. Referrals; disapprovals.
A. Concurrent review. In all cases where site plan approval is required, as
stated in other sections of this chapter, or where subdivision approval is
§ 535-76 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 535-79
520:817
§ 535-80. Criteria for recommendations.
The Design Review Board shall base its recommendations on the following
criteria. No building or structure or land development shall be so
detrimental to the desirability, property values or development of the
surrounding area as to provoke one or more of the harmful effects set forth
in § 535-76 by reason of:
required, the review by the Design Review Board for similarity,
dissimilarity, or inappropriateness of structures shall be given, if at all
possible, concurrent with the Planning Board's review for subdivision
and/or site plan approval. If the architectural plans and designs are not
advanced enough to permit simultaneous review, the Planning Board
may act but condition its final approval on subsequent design review.
B. Action independent of Planning Board. In all cases where site plan
approval is not required by the Planning Board, such as for one- and
two-family residences, and for remodeling and renovation projects,
separate application shall be made to the Design Review Board and
approval is required prior to the issuance of a building permit.
C. Referrals. The Building Official shall promptly refer to the Design
Review Board every application for a building permit. Such Board may
approve, or conditionally approve, subject to specified modifications, or
disapprove any application for a building permit, provided that such
Board finds the structure or building, if erected or altered as proposed
in the application for building permit, would be so detrimental to the
desirability, property values, or development of the surrounding areas
as to be the cause of one of the harmful effects set forth in § 535-76
hereof.
D. Recommendation to Building Official. The Building Official shall refuse
any building permit application which is disapproved as provided
herein. If the Design Review Board shall fail to disapprove, or
conditionally approve subject to specified modifications, any such
application referred to it within 45 days of the date of filing of such
application, or if such Board shall approve any such application, the
Building Official shall forthwith issue the building permit, provided that
it conforms in all respects to all other applicable laws and regulations.
E. Exclusion. This chapter shall not apply to a residential accessory
structure on individual property when not part of a major or minor
subdivision. Furthermore, no design review shall be required for the
alteration of the interior of any structure, or for the normal
maintenance and repair of the exterior of any structure.
A. Excessive similarity. Excessive similarity to any other existing structure
or one for which a permit has been issued, or to any other structure
included in the same permit application, facing upon the same or
intersecting street and within 500 feet of the proposed site as measured
along center lines of streets in a residence district, and within 250 feet
§ 535-79 PORT JERVIS CODE § 535-80
520:818
of the proposed site in any nonresidential district in respect to one or
more of the following features of exterior design and appearance:
(1) Apparently identical elevations as they relate to form, proportion,
texture and color;
(2) Substantially identical size and arrangement of either doors,
windows, porticos, or other openings or breaks in the elevation
facing the street, including reverse arrangement;
(3) Other signification identical features of design, such as, but not
limited to, material, roofline and height, or other design elements,
provided that a finding of excessive similarity shall state not only
that such excessive similarity exists but also that it is of such a
nature as to be reasonably expected to provoke one or more of the
harmful effects set forth in § 535-76; or
(4) Other significant identical features of site design, such as, but not
limited to, setbacks and alignment with street and other structures.
B. Excessive dissimilarity. Excessive dissimilarity in relation to any other
structures existing or for which a permit has been issued, or to any
other structures included in the same permit application, facing upon
the same or intersecting street and within 500 feet of the proposed site
as measured along center lines of streets in any residence district, and
within 250 feet of the proposed site in any nonresidential district, in
respect to one or more of the following features, provided that the
finding is not based on personal preference as to taste or choice of
architectural style:
(1) Cubical contents.
(2) Gross floor area.
(3) Height of building or height of roof.
(4) Other significant design features, such as types of materials used,
the durability of materials and the texture of the buildings, roof
structures, chimneys, exposed mechanical equipment, service and
storage enclosures, signs, landscaping, retaining walls, fencing,
lighting posts and standards.
C. Inappropriateness. Inappropriateness in relation to the established
character of other structures in the immediate area or neighboring
areas with respect to the significant design features, such as the
texture, color, character (style), and form of architectural design,
provided that the Board shall find that the inappropriateness which
exists is of such a nature as to be reasonably expected to be the cause of
one or more of the harmful effects set forth in § 535-76 hereof and that
the finding is not based on personal preference as to taste or choice of
architectural style.

disapproving a building permit application and of the Building Official
in denying such permit because of such disapproval may take an appeal
therefrom to the Zoning Board of Appeals in the same manner as is provided
for other zoning appeals, and such Zoning Board of Appeals, with the same
power and authority therein vested in passing upon appeals before it under
the provisions of law and these regulations, and in exercise thereof, may
reverse or affirm, or modify and affirm, the actions of the Design Review
Board and of the Building Official.
§ 535-82. Procedures.

procedural outline designed to carry out the intent of this chapter. Such
procedure shall be submitted to the Common Council for approval in the
form of a Common Council resolution.
§ 535-83. Employees and expenses; fees.
A. Employees and expenses. The Design Review Board shall have the
power and authority to employ experts and staff and to pay for their
services and such other expenses as may be necessary and proper, not
exceeding, in all, the appropriation that may be made for such Board.
Legal counsel for the Design Review Board shall be the Planning Board
Attorney.
B. Fees. Every application for review by the Design Review Board shall be
accompanied by a fee as prescribed by the fee schedule of the City of

Zoning Board of Appeals may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may
modify the order, requirement, decision, interpretation or
determination appealed from and shall make such order, requirement,

been made in the matter by the administrative official charged with the
enforcement of this chapter and to that end shall have all the powers or
the administrative official from whose order, requirement, decision,
interpretation or determination the appeal is taken.
C. Use variances.
(1) The Zoning Board of Appeals, on appeal from the decision or
determination of the administrative official charged with the
enforcement of this chapter, shall have the power to grant use
variances, as defined herein.
(2) No such use variance shall be granted by the Zoning Board of
Appeals without a showing by the applicant that applicable zoning
regulations and restrictions have caused unnecessary hardship. In
order to prove such unnecessary hardship the applicant shall
demonstrate to the Zoning Board of Appeals that for each and
every permitted use under the zoning regulations for the particular
district where the property is located:
(a) The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided that
lack of return is substantial as demonstrated by competent
financial evidence;
210. Editor's Note: Throughout this chapter, references to the "Board of Appeals" were
amended to "Zoning Board of Appeals" at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General
Provisions, Art. III).
§ 535-84 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS § 535-85

from a decision or determination of the administrative official
charged with the enforcement of this chapter, to grant area
variances as defined herein.
(2) In making its determination, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall take
into consideration the benefit to the applicant if the variance is
granted, as weighted against the detriment to the health, safety
and welfare of the neighborhood or community by such grant. In
making such determination the Board shall also consider:

character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby
properties will be created by the granting of the area variance;

shall grant the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and
adequate and at the same time preserve and protect the character
of the neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the

the two following conditions, the Secretary of the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall transmit to the designated office or official a copy of the

pursuant to this section and Department of Health requirements.
(5) The cost to install a backflow prevention device shall be borne by
the owner of the property.
(6) The Director of Public Works or designee shall make a
