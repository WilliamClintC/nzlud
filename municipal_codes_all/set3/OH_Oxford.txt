EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR’S NOTE:  Source material for the Codified Ordinances of Oxford was
either ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by
the Adopting Ordinance.  Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any
history indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance.  In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Oxford Codified Ordinances is indicated.

   101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture or

violation of any section included in such reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)

irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
(ORC 1.52)

      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
(ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
(ORC 1.49)
   101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

   (c)   Purpose of Special Meetings. The regularly scheduled meetings of this
body shall be held on the first and third Tuesday of each month in the Council
chambers at the Court House.  Within the context of this section, a special

the purpose of this section, may be for the purpose of:
      (1)   Continuing or commencing a regular meeting of Council in discussing
and acting upon all such business as may come before the body; or
      (2)   A special meeting within the context of parliamentary definition,

meeting, as defined herein, shall be held until the Clerk of Council has given
at least 24 hours advance notice of the date, time, place and purpose of such
meeting to those news media that have requested notification, except in the
event of an emergency. An emergency exists when immediate official action is
necessary. In that event, the member, or members, calling such a meeting shall

the Clerk and sending forth their name, address and telephone number. The Clerk
shall notify such person of the date, time, place and purpose of special
meetings either by e-mail or telephone and will in any case endeavor with all
reasonable effort and dispatch to make such notification immediately. When time
permits reasonable anticipation of timely mail delivery, the Clerk may notify
such person by mail. When, in the judgment of the Clerk, it seems reasonable to
believe mail notification will not be timely, the Clerk shall make all
reasonable efforts to contact such person by e-mail or telephone.

practices as defined in this chapter, or upon its own initiative, in matters
relating to such discriminatory practices, the Civil Rights Director may

in, he shall endeavor to eliminate such practices by informal methods of
conference, conciliation and persuasion. If after such investigation and
conference, the Director is satisfied that any unlawful discriminatory practice
of the respondent will be eliminated, it may treat the complaint as conciliated
and notify the complainant that it will not initiate prosecution of the matter.

discriminatory practices or to obtain conciliation of the matter, or, if the
circumstances warrant, in advance of or during any such preliminary
investigation or endeavors to conciliate the matter, the Director shall issue
and cause to be served upon the respondent a notice of an investigative
hearing, notifying the respondent of an investigative hearing before the Civil

of the Civil Rights Commission, permitted to appear for the presentation of
oral or written argument.
   (f)   In any proceeding the Civil Rights Commission shall not be bound by
the rules of evidence prevailing in the courts of law or equity, but shall in
ascertaining the practices followed by the respondent, take into account all
reliable, probative and substantial evidence, statistical or otherwise,
produced at the hearing, which may tend to prove the existence of an unlawful
discriminatory practice or a predetermined pattern of unlawful discriminatory
practice under this chapter, provided that nothing contained in this section
shall be construed to authorize or require any person to observe the proportion
which persons of any race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sexual

criterion other than the individual qualifications of the applicant.

   (i)   In conducting any hearing as provided herein, the Commission may
subpoena as witnesses any person believed to have knowledge of facts relevant

the Civil Rights Commission shall issue subpoenas as if issued on its own

         D.   In accordance with ORC Section 718.051 and the Rules and
Regulations, taxpayers subject to the city income tax on the net profits from a
business or profession may file the city income tax return by using the Ohio
Business Gateway.
      (3)   A return filed under this Section shall be timely if the return is
postmarked no later than April 15.
   (e)   Extensions of Time for Filing Returns.
      (1)   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a Federal
income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a City Income Tax
Return by filing a copy of the taxpayer’s Federal extension request with the
City Tax Division.  Any taxpayer not required to file a Federal income tax
return may request an extension for filing a City Income Tax Return in
writing.  The request for extension must be filed on or before the original due
date for the annual return.  If the request is granted, the due date for filing
a return is extended for six (6) months from the original due date of such
return.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deny a taxpayer’s request for extension
if the taxpayer:
         A.   Fails to timely file the request; or
         B.   Fails to file a copy of the Federal extension request, (if
applicable); or
         C.   Owes the City any delinquent income tax, penalty, interest or
other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of income tax; or
         D.   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (3)   The granting of an extension for filing a City tax return does not
extend the due date as provided in this Section for payment of the tax; hence,
penalty and interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the period of extension
at the rate set out by Section
 181.03(a).  No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is
filed and the final tax paid within the extension period provided all other
filing and the final tax paid within the extension period provided all other
filing and payment requirements of the Tax Code have been met.  Any extension
by the Tax Administrator shall be granted  upon the condition that declaration
filing and payment requirements have been fulfilled, however, if, upon further
examination it then becomes evident that declaration filing and payment
requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be assessed in
full and in the same manner as though no extension had been granted.
   (f)   Payment of Tax.
      (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due. 
However, credit shall be allowed for:
         A.   Any portion of the tax so due which shall have been deducted at
the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.06; and
         B.   Any portion of said tax which shall have been paid by the
taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.07; and
         C.   Credit to the extent allowed by Section
 181.14 for tax paid to another municipality.
      (2)   Subject to the limitations contained in Section
181.11 of this Tax Code, any taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to
which the City is entitled under the provisions of the Tax Code may have such
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at this
election indicated on the return, such overpayment, or part thereof, shall be
refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than five
dollars ($5.00) shall be collected or refunded.
   (g)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due or claim a refund of tax
overpaid subject to the requirements an/or limitations contained in Sections
181.11 and
181.14.  The Tax Administrator shall provide by regulation the format in which
such amended return shall be filed.  A taxpayer may not change the method of
accounting or appointment of net profits after the due date for filing the
original return.
      (2)   Within three (3) months from the final determination of any Federal
tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s City tax liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended City return showing income subject to the City tax
based upon such final determination of Federal tax liability and pay any
additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment. 
   (h)   Required Supplemental Information.  Information returns, schedules and
statements required to support tax returns which are incomplete without such
information shall be filed within the time limits set forth for the filing of
the tax returns and the failure to file such information returns, schedules and
statements shall be a violation of this Tax Code.  Provided, however, that the
taxpayer shall have fourteen (14) days after notification by the Tax
Administrator, or his authorized representative, to file the items required by
this paragraph.  Examples of supplemental information includes but is not
limited to copies of W-2 forms, 1099- MISC forms, page one of Form 1040, page
one and two of Form 1120, 1120S(including (K-1), Form 2106, page one and two of
Form 1065, Schedule C (including cost of goods manufactured and/or sold),
Schedule E, Schedule F and any other Federal Schedules if applicable.
(Ord. 2957.  Passed 5-1-07.)
   181.06  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Withholding by Employer.  Each employer within or doing business
within the City who employs one or more persons on a  salary, qualifying wage,
commission or other compensation basis shall deduct, when such salary,
qualifying wage, commission or other compensation is paid, allocated or set
aside, the tax at the rate provided in Section
181.03 hereof on of the gross salaries, qualifying wages, commissions or other
compensation due by such employer to the each employee; and shall, on or before
the fifteenth (15th) day of the month following such withholding, make a return
and pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes so deducted.  Returns
shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable to the Tax
Administrator, and shall be subject to the Rules and Regulations prescribed by
the Tax Administrator.  The employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax
required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not the taxes have, in fact,
been withheld.
    (b)   Filings by Employers.  So long as the taxes withheld by an employer
for the City during the measurement period as less than three hundred dollars
($300.00) per month, payments may be made quarterly on or before the last day
of the month following the end of each quarter, subject to the approval of the
Tax Administrator.  The Tax Administrator may revoke the approval of quarterly
filing and payments whenever the Tax Administrator has reason to believe that
the conditions for granting such authorization have changed, were judged
incorrectly, were not met, or when it is in the best interest of the City to do
so.  Notice of withdrawal shall be made in writing and, in such case; the
employer must begin to file in accordance with this Section.
   (c)   Employer Considered as Trustee.  Each employer in collecting such tax
shall be deemed to hold the same, until payment is made by such employer to the
City, as a trustee for the benefit of the City, and any such tax collected by
such employer from his employees shall, until the same is paid to the City, be
deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer.  Each employer shall be
liable for the payment of the tax to be deducted and withheld whether or not
such tax, in fact has been withheld.
   (d)   Individual Liability.  Any person who is required to withhold tax from
salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation shall pay such
tax to the City in accordance with the provisions of this Section.  In the
event taxes withheld from the salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and
other compensation of employees are not paid to the City in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, all officers, members, managers, employees, and
trustees having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility of
filing the return and making the payment are jointly and severally personally
liable for the tax not returned or paid to the City as well as any related
interest and penalties, and are also liable under the provisions of Section
 181.12 hereof.  The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation,
limited liability company, or business trust does not discharge an officer’s,
member’s, manager’s, employee’s or trustee’s liability for a failure of the
corporation, limited liability company, or business trust to file returns or
pay said taxes.
   (e)   List of Employees.  Each employer shall file a withholding tax
reconciliation showing the sum total of all compensation paid all employees,
the portion of which, (if any) was not subject to withholding along with an
explanation for same, and the portion of which was subject to withholding 
together with the amount of such withholdings remitted.  Such return shall
include information concerning each employee from whom the City tax was
withheld, showing the name, address, and zip code of each such employee, the
total amount of compensation paid during the year and the amount of City tax
withheld.  If the total tax from any employee included tax withheld and
remitted to another municipality, the amount of same shall be separately shown
on the return of information to the City concerning each employee.  The
withholding tax reconciliation shall be filed by each employer on or before the
February 28th following the end of such calendar year.
   (f)   Contractors and Subcontractors.  In addition to the qualifying wage
reporting requirements of this Section, any person required by the Internal
Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-MISC payments to individuals not treated
as employees for services performed shall also report such payments to the City
when the services were performed in the City.  The information may be submitted
on a listing, and shall include the name, address, and zip code (or Federal
identification number), and the amount of the payments made.  Federal form(s)
1099 may be submitted in lieu of such listing.  The information shall be filed
annually on or before February 28th following the end of such calendar year.
   (g)   Domestic Servants.  No person shall be required to withhold the tax on
the qualifying wages or other compensation paid domestic servants employed
exclusively in or about such person’s residence.  However, such domestic
servants shall be responsible for filing and paying their own returns and
taxes.
   (h)   Electronic Funds Transfers.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the payment of
taxes by electronic funds transfer does not affect an employer’s obligation to
file returns as required under this Section.  The Tax Administrator may adopt
rules governing the format for filing of returns under this Section by
employers who remit undeposited taxes by electronic funds transfer.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall adopt rules governing the remittance of
taxes by electronic funds transfer as provided for in this Section.  The rules
shall govern the modes of electronic funds transfer and under what
circumstances each mode is acceptable, the content and format of electronic
funds transfers, the coordination of payment of electronic funds transfer.  The
Tax Administrator may implement means of acknowledging, upon request of an
employer, receipt of tax remittances made by electronic funds transfer, and may
adopt rules governing acknowledgments.  The cost of acknowledging receipt of
electronic remittances shall be paid by the person requesting acknowledgement.

previous year or where he has filed a previous return and has failed to file a
declaration on which he has estimated and paid tax equal to or greater than

   181.11  COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS.
   (a)   Time Limitations on Suits.  All taxes imposed by this Chapter shall be

other debts of like amount are recoverable.  No additional assessment shall be
made after three (3) years from the time the tax was due or the return was
filed, whichever is later; provided however, there shall be no period of
limitation on an additional assessment in a case of a return that omits gross
income in excess of twenty-five per cent (25%) of that required to be reported
or in the case of filing a false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the
tax, or in the case of failure to file a return.  In those cases in which the

time of the final determination of the Federal tax liability.

of the overpayment, with the following exception: No interest shall be allowed
on any overpayment that is refunded within ninety (90) days after the final
filing date of the annual return or ninety (90) days after the complete return
is filed, whichever is later.  For purposes of computing the payment of
interest on overpayments, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be
treated as having been paid before the date on which the tax return for that
year was due without regard to any extension of time for filing that return. 
The interest shall be paid at the rate of interest prescribed by  ORC 5703.47.
(Ord. 2957.  Passed 5-1-07.)

   181.13  BOARD OF REVIEW.
   (a)   Composition.  A Board of Review, consisting of three City residents
appointed by the City Manager and approved by the Council, is hereby created. 
Board members shall be appointed for terms of three years; however, the members
of the first Board shall be appointed for one, two and three years
respectively.  A majority of the members of the Board shall constitute a
quorum.  The Board shall adopt its own procedural rules and shall keep a record
of its transactions.  Any hearing by the Board may be conducted privately and

be disclosed by this Chapter shall apply to such matters as may be heard before
the Board on appeal.
   (b)   Approval of Rules and Regulations.  All rules and regulations and
amendments or changes thereto which are adopted by the Tax Administrator under
the authority conferred by this Chapter must be approved by the Board before
the same becomes effective.  After such approval, such rules, regulations,
amendments, and changes shall be filed with the Clerk of Council and shall be
open to public inspection.  The Board shall hear and pass on appeals from any

request shall be in writing, shall state with particularity why the decision
should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within thirty days
from the announcement of such ruling or decision by the Tax Administrator.
   (e)   Restriction of Penalty and Interest.  The imposition of penalty and

basis for an appeal.
   (f)   Hearings.  The Board of Review shall schedule a hearing within forty-
five (45) days after receiving the request, unless the taxpayer waives a
hearing.  If the taxpayer does not waive a hearing, the taxpayer may appear

precludes a person from carrying forward, for use with respect to any return
filed for a taxable year beginning after 2018, any amount of net operating loss
that was not fully utilized by operation of division (C)(24)(c)(iii)(a) of this
section. To the extent that an amount of net operating loss that was not fully
utilized in one or more taxable years by operation of division (C)(1)(h)(iii)
(a) of this section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed
for a taxable year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation
described in division (C)(24)(c)(iii)(a) of this section shall apply to the

182.12 (A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer

the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this

   (A)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the City of Oxford shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying
wages earned and/or received by each employee in the City of Oxford.  Except
for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under Section
182.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
182.01 of this chapter, of 2%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that
the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively
pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit
of, the employee.   
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the City of Oxford the greater of the income taxes deducted
and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the City of Oxford in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or
if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted
and withheld on behalf of the City of Oxford in any month of the preceding
calendar quarter exceeded $200.
Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made so that the
payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the
last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last  day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         (c)     Intentionally left blank.
      (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City of Oxford. The payment of
tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an
employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required
under this section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by  Tax Administrator and the City of Oxford as the
return required of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax
under this Chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the City of Oxford income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the City of Oxford the tax withheld relieves the employee
from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)     Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
City of Oxford income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent
the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City of Oxford until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the City of Oxford during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,

calendar year; 
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the City of Oxford
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section
Occasional Entrant - Withholding.

corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a

following conditions applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the

entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
City of Oxford only if the employee spent more time performing services for or
on behalf of the employer in the City of Oxford than in any other municipal
corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an
employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more
of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the
employee's principal place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first

employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's

services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the City of Oxford exceeds the 20-day threshold, the
employer shall withhold and remit tax to the City of Oxford for any subsequent
days in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in the City of Oxford.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the City of
Oxford under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
the City of Oxford for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the employee for personal services performed in the City of Oxford.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is the City of Oxford and the
employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
182.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
City of Oxford, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked
outside the corporate boundaries of the City of Oxford.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, a the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.

services within the City of Oxford, make any sales in the City of Oxford, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the City of Oxford during the
taxable year.  If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the City
of Oxford for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer
and to properly comply as a taxpayer with the City of Oxford's income tax
ordinance and rules and regulations."  The person shall sign the affidavit
under penalty of perjury.
         (c)     If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)

or rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or
documents.

States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the City of
Oxford for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension

evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate
eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.  However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. 
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)     Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the

division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to

division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order

period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

   (R)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a

taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the City of
Oxford's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)
(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown. 
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a

      (3)    An election made under divisions (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated City of Oxford income tax return for that taxable year if
the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the City of Oxford. A taxpayer that is required to
file a consolidated City of Oxford income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated City of Oxford income tax return for all subsequent taxable
years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the
Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
182.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated City of Oxford income tax
return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
182.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated City of Oxford income tax
return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's
net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of Oxford. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of Oxford. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of Oxford;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to City of Oxford
income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated City of Oxford income tax return
shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
182.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated City of Oxford income tax
return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by the City of Oxford in accordance with this
Chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City of Oxford before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the City of Oxford may continue to
file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   182.06  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)    Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the City of Oxford who is
required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to
another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this Chapter may
claim a nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the
other municipality.  Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit shall
not exceed the tax due the City of Oxford under this Chapter. 
   (B)     The City of Oxford shall grant a credit against its tax on income to
a resident of the City of Oxford who works in a joint economic development zone
created under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created
under Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it
grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in
another municipal corporation.
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality. 
   (D)     Intentionally left blank.

this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld for the City of Oxford from qualifying wages
shall be considered as paid to the City of Oxford in equal amounts on each
payment date unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts
were actually withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid on the
dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the City of Oxford,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45) percent of the tax liability

         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half (67.5) percent of

shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
182.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
182.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the City of Oxford under Section
182.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City of Oxford
but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year
that includes the first day of the taxable year.

(Ord. 3462.  Passed 2-20-18.)
   182.09  REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in

accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax

      (1)    Overpayments of ten dollars or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars or
more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
       (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except
as provided in division (C)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall
issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or
partially denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was
denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the
assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been

on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
182.18 (A)(4).

   182.10  SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR
REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the City of Oxford, but
should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City
of Oxford as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the City of Oxford is subject to recovery by the City

or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first municipality with
respect to such income or wages. 
   (C)    If the City of Oxford's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the
other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City of Oxford's tax rate.  However, if the City of Oxford's tax rate is
greater than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of
the nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the City of Oxford, along with any
penalty and interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 3462.  Passed 2-20-18.)
   182.11  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
the City of Oxford changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return
with the City of Oxford. The amended return shall be filed on a form required
by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal

return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten

facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
182.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the City of Oxford. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
182.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.  All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.

tax liability affecting the taxpayer's the City of Oxford's tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended City of Oxford return showing income
subject to City of Oxford income tax based upon such final determination of
federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional the City
of Oxford income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any
overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten dollars.

whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
182.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
182.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City of Oxford does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
182.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
182.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover City of Oxford income tax or related
penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time
periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 3462.  Passed 2-20-18.)
   182.13  AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest
(Ord. 3462.  Passed 2-20-18.)
   182.14  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC.  With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other City of Oxford official, or
the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the
assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by
filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the
receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator
under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery
is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within  60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City of Oxford
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 3462.  Passed 2-20-18.)
   182.15  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the City of Oxford that arises pursuant to the City of Oxford's income tax
imposed in accordance with this Chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due. 
(Ord. 3462.  Passed 2-20-18.)
   182.16  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the City of Oxford
as authorized by this Chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this Chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the City of Oxford from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 3462.  Passed 2-20-18.)
   182.17  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the City of Oxford ordinance or
state law to be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the City of Oxford or the Tax
Administrator.

         (a)    Any return required to be filed under applicable law for
taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         (b)    Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to the City of Oxford on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the City of Oxford to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be

   (C)    Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer

   182.19  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (A)    Nothing in this Chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the

thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is

for the income tax levied by the City of Oxford or for the withholding of such
tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.
Identification information.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits  the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this Chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section 182.18, in addition to any
applicable penalty described in Section
182.99.
         (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
182.19 within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
182.18.
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
182.99 for a violation of Section
182.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

subject to appeal.

with the City of Oxford at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by
the City Manager of the City of Oxford. This member may be an employee of the

the discretion of the administrative official.
      (3)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person
or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not

meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.

as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the

remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the

Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member

Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax
Review. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons
why the assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed
within 60 days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day

determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination as
provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC.

CHAPTER.
   (A)    A taxpayer may elect to be subject to Sections

Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, upon the taxpayer's
election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)    The Tax Commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator of the
municipal net profit tax for which the taxpayer as defined in
182.28(C) of the Codified Ordinances is liable for the term of the election;
      (2)    The Tax Commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to sections
718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code, Sections

Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the Tax Commissioner and the City of Oxford, on a form prescribed

until the taxpayer notifies the Tax Commissioner and the City of Oxford of its
termination of the election.
         (b)    A notification of termination shall be made, on a form

         (c)    Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the

this chapter.
   (C)    The Tax Commissioner shall enforce and administer Sections
182.27 to

      (3)    Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out
the duties imposed upon the Tax Commissioner by those Sections.

182.02 of the this chapter.
(Ord.  3463.  Passed 2-20-18.)
182.28  DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in Sections
182.27 to
182.42 is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable context
in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax and in
Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then the use of
the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax shall
have control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Revised Code, unless
the term is defined in Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code, in which case the
definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference in this chapter to the
Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United States related to
federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this Section and Section
182.02, the definition in this Section shall control for all uses of that term
in Sections
 182.27 to
182.42 of this chapter.
   As used in Sections
182.27 to
182.42 of this chapter only:
   (A)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under Section
182.29, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward
available to the person for the municipal corporation.
   (B)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code and
Section
 182.02, means a C corporation's federal taxable income before net operating
losses and special deductions as determined under the Internal Revenue Code,
adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this Section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this Section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    Division (B)(4)(a) of this Section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
Section
182.33.
      (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of Section
182.33.
If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (C)(48)(b) of Section
 182.02, and is not a publicly traded partnership that has made the election
described in division (C)(24)(e) of Section
182.02, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal taxable income under this
Section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation, except guaranteed payments and
other similar amounts paid or accrued to a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deductible expense unless such payments are in consideration for the use
of capital and treated as payment of interest under section 469 of the Internal
Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to
a qualified self-employed retirement plan with respect to a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of the
taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and
amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deduction.
Nothing in division (B) of this Section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in Section
182.02(C)(48), except that "taxpayer" does not include natural persons or
entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745. of the Revised Code.
"Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when
such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (D)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to Sections
182.27 to
 182.42 for the purpose of reporting municipal income taxes, and includes
declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections
182.27 to
182.42 is changed accordingly but may consist of an aggregation of more than
one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The Tax Commissioner may
prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable year for a taxpayer that
has had a change of its taxable year for federal income tax purposes, for a
taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years for federal income tax
purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for a new taxpayer that
would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to Section
182.37.
      (Ord.  3463.  Passed 2-20-18.)
182.29  APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This Section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the City of Oxford and that has made the election under Section
182.27.
   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this Section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the City of Oxford shall be considered as having a taxable situs
in the City of Oxford for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City of Oxford during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City of Oxford to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
182.04;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City of
Oxford to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same
period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
Section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the City of Oxford, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Commissioner may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
182.37.
      (3)    The Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this Section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
 182.37.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this Section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)   The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this Section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this Section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the Tax Commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this Section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the City of
Oxford as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the City of Oxford  only if, regardless of where title passes,
the property meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the City of
Oxford from a stock of goods located within the City of Oxford.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the City of Oxford from a
location outside the City of Oxford, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
City of Oxford and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
City of Oxford to the extent that such services are performed in the City of
Oxford.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the City of Oxford  shall be sitused to the City of
Oxford.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the City of Oxford shall be sitused to
the City of Oxford.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City of Oxford based upon the extent to which
the tangible personal property is used in the City of Oxford.
   (E)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the City of Oxford
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to the City of Oxford based upon the ratio
of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or
lease of real estate located in the City of Oxford to the commissions received
from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable
year.
   (F)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (C)(12)(l) and (C)(35)(b). of Section
182.02 by the City of Oxford or substantially similar provision of the codified
ordinances of another municipal corporation, the taxpayer shall add the amount
that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned
to the City of Oxford. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its
net profit that was apportioned to the City of Oxford any amount other than the
amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the amount
related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City of Oxford
under this Section.
   (G)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this Section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this Section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

municipal net profits tax for taxpayers making the election provided in Section
182.27. The Tax Administrator shall review these returns and information, as
well as the information received pursuant to divisions (B) and (C) of this
Section, and has discretion to refer any taxpayer for audit by the Tax
Commissioner. Such referral shall be made on a form prescribed by the
commissioner and shall include any information that forms the basis for the
referral.
      (2)    If the Tax Commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the Tax Administrator under this Section, the City of Oxford reserves its right
to pursue any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure that the
correct tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.
         (Ord.  3463.  Passed 2-20-18.)
182.31  FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (A)   (1)    For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual

182.35, shall be submitted to the Tax Commissioner, on a form and in the manner
prescribed by the commissioner, on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth
month following the end of the taxpayer's taxable year.
      (2)    If a taxpayer has multiple taxable years ending within one
calendar year, the taxpayer hall aggregate the facts and figures necessary to
compute the tax due under this chapter, in accordance with Sections
182.28,
182.29, and, if applicable,
182.33 onto its annual return.

         (b)    A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically

   (D)   (1)   (a)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a tax return with the
commissioner under this Section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)    An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this
Section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax
Commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)    If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with Section
182.01, the commissioner may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this Section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
   (E)    Each return required to be filed in accordance with this Section
shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the Tax Commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.
   (F)    When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the Tax Commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
(Ord.  3463.  Passed 2-20-18.)
182.32   ELECTRONIC FILING.
   (A)    All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under Section
182.27 shall file any tax return or extension for filing a tax return, and
shall make payment of amounts shown to be due on such returns, electronically,
either through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by
the Tax Commissioner.
   (B)    A taxpayer may apply to the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the
commissioner, to be excused from the requirement to file returns and make
payments electronically. For good cause shown, the commissioner may excuse the
applicant from the requirement and permit the applicant to file the returns or
make the payments by nonelectronic means.
   (C)    The Tax Commissioner may adopt rules establishing the following:
      (1)    The format of documents to be used by taxpayers to file returns
and make payments by electronic means;
      (2)    The information taxpayers must submit when filing tax returns by
electronic means.  (Ord.  3463.  Passed 2-20-18.)
182.33  CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (A)    As used in this Section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this Section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
Section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Commissioner. The Tax
Commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this Section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this Section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this Section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section
182.27, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division (S) of Section
182.05 is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for the remainder of the five-year
period.
      (5)    When an election made under Section
182.27 is terminated, a valid election made under this Section is binding upon
the Tax Administrator for the remainder of the five-year period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the Tax Commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this Section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
182.28, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of Section
182.28 to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to
the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.29, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
 182.29, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in Section
182.29, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections
182.27 to
182.42 on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
182.29 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that Section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that Section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Section
 182.27 to
182.42 or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the corporation, an affiliated
group of which the corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year,
or any one or more members of such an affiliated group.  (Ord.  3463.  Passed
2-20-18.)
182.34  FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
 182.27 fails to pay any tax as required under Sections
182.27 to
182.42, or any portion of that tax, on or before the date prescribed for its
payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and paid, in the same manner as
the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per annum prescribed by section
5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date prescribed for its payment until it
is paid or until the date an assessment is issued under Section
182.37, whichever occurs first.
(Ord.  3463.  Passed 2-20-18.)
182.35  DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this Section:
      (1)    "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this Section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this Section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The Tax Commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the Tax Commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this Section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this Section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this Section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this Section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this Section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections
182.27 to
182.42 and shall be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in
accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this Section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the inco
me received during the year up to the end of the month immediately preceding
the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
         (Ord.  3463.  Passed 2-20-18.)
182.36  ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by Sections
 182.27 to
182.42 or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code, the following penalties shall
apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under Sections
 182.27 to
182.42 fails to make and file the return within the time prescribed, including
any extensions of time granted by the Tax Commissioner, the commissioner may
impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five dollars per month or fraction of a
month, for each month or fraction of a month elapsing between the due date,
including extensions of the due date, and the date on which the return is
filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under this division shall not
exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)   If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Sections
182.27 to
182.42 fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a penalty not to exceed the
following:
         (a)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (b)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
182.27 fails to timely pay an amount of tax required to be paid under this
chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to fifteen per cent of the
amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections
182.27 to
182.42 that does not contain information upon which the substantial correctness
of the return may be judged or contains information that on its face indicates
that the return is substantially incorrect, and the filing of the return in
that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a desire that is apparent
from the return to delay or impede the administration of Sections
182.27 to
182.42, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections
 182.27 to
182.42, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of one thousand
dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to be shown on the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
Section
182.38, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of one thousand
dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any penalty imposed under this
division, any refund issued on the claim, and interest on any refund from the
date of the refund, may be assessed under Section
 182.37 without regard to any time limitation for the assessment imposed by
division (A) of that Section.
   (B)    For purposes of this Section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this Section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this Section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this Section may be abated by the Tax Commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)    All amounts collected under this Section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections
182.27 to
 182.42 and shall be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in the
same proportion as the underlying tax liability is required to be distributed
to such municipal corporations under section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
(Ord.  3463.  Passed 2- 20-18.)
182.37  ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under Sections
182.27 to
182.42 fails to file the return within the time prescribed, files an incorrect
return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for the period covered
by the return, the Tax Commissioner may make an assessment against the taxpayer
for any deficiency for the period for which the return or tax is due, based
upon any information in the commissioner's possession.
   The Tax Commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in Section
 182.38 for the same period of time. There shall be no bar or limit to an
assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return subject to assessment
as required by Sections
 182.27 to
182.42, or that files a fraudulent return. The commissioner shall give the
taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided in section
5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the commissioner shall provide
instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a hearing on the
petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the Tax Commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the Tax
Commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the Tax
Commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this Section.
   (D)    All money collected under this Section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this Section.
   (E)    If the Tax Commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this Section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this Section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the Tax Commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by Section
182.38, with interest on that amount as provided by that Section.
(Ord.  3463.  Passed 2-20-18.)
182.38  REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
182.27 to
182.42, including assessments, shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner within
three years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of
the tax, or within any additional period allowed by division (A) of Section
182.37. The application shall be filed in the form prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner.
   (B)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the Tax Commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this Section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this Section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.  (Ord.  3463.  Passed
2-20-18.)
182.39  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under Section
182.27 and used to determine the tax due under Sections
182.27 to
182.42 must be altered as the result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal
income tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or the internal revenue
service, and such alteration affects the taxpayer's tax liability under those
Sections, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax Commissioner
in such form as the commissioner requires. The amended return shall be filed
not later than sixty days after the adjustment is agreed upon or finally
determined for federal income tax purposes or after any federal income tax
deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit resulting therefrom, has been
assessed or paid, whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer intends to file an
amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to amend its type of
return from a separate return to a consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's
consolidated federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the
commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this Section is a
return subject to assessment under Section
182.37 for the purpose of assessing any additional tax due under this Section,
together with any applicable penalty and interest. The amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return no longer subject to assessment that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
Section
182.38, if the application otherwise conforms to the requirements of that
Section. An application filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments
required in the taxpayer's annual return that are affected, either directly or
indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return
unless it is also filed within the time prescribed in Section
182.38. The application shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return.
(Ord.  3463.  Passed 2-20-18.)
182.40  EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)    The Tax Commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to Sections
182.27 to

the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or

of this section.  If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

   313.01  OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. 
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.  Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place. 
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.  If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

   313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

   313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)

being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used.  (ORC 4511.14)

the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left

whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This limitation does not apply to
the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person authorized to withdraw blood
under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this subsection, if in
that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person would be endangered
by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains.  The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or

         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty. 
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them.  Whoever violates
subsection (a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while
under the influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of
a controlled substance.  The court shall sentence the offender for either
offense under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as
otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).

commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years.  The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. 
The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock
device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days.  The
court shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection
unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a
sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of
house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or
with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.  The court
may impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term.  The
cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community

determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).

commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to

jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed one year.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may

established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or

under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

religious event provided the holder of a  probationary driver’s license with
the written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section.
The Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall make available at no cost a form to serve
as the written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section,

and holders of probationary driver’s licenses may utilize that form or may
choose to utilize any other written documentation to meet the requirements of
that subsection.
      (4)   No holder of a probationary driver’s license who has held the

highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking with more than one person who is not a family
member occupying the vehicle unless the probationary license holder is
accompanied by the probationary license holder’s parent, guardian or custodian.
   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or
B. of this section if, at the time of the violation, an emergency existed that

vehicle in violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. of this section; or the
holder was an emancipated minor.
   (c)   (1)   If a person is issued a probationary driver’s license prior to
attaining the age of seventeen years and the person pleads guilty to, is
convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving
violation during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the
person is issued the probationary driver’s license, the court with jurisdiction
over the violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle
upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking for a period not to exceed six months
or the date the holder attains the age of seventeen years, whichever occurs
first.
      (2)   Any person who is subject to the operating restrictions established
under subsection (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for driving privileges without being accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection.  In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted.  If a person is convicted of,
pleads guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a
second or subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the
violation may terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this
division.
      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under
subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
   (d)   No holder of a probationary license shall operate a motor vehicle upon
a highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking unless the total number of occupants of the vehicle
does not exceed the total number of occupant restraining devices originally
installed in the motor vehicle by its manufacturer, and each occupant of the
vehicle is wearing all of the available elements of a properly adjusted
occupant restraining device.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or
is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for such a violation or for causing the arrest of or commencing a
prosecution of a person for such violation.
   (g)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Occupant restraining device” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C.
4513.263.
      (2)   “Family member” of a probationary license holder includes any of
the following:
         A.   A spouse;
         B.   A child or stepchild;

         F.   A son or daughter of the probationary license holder’s stepparent
if the stepparent has not adopted the probationary license holder;
         G.   An eligible adult, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4507.05.
      (3)   “Moving violation” means any violation of any statute or ordinance
that regulates the operation of vehicles, streetcars, or trackless trolleys on
the highways or streets.  “Moving violation” does not include a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4513.263 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a
violation of any statute or ordinance regulating pedestrians or the parking of
vehicles, vehicle size or load limitations, vehicle fitness requirements, or
vehicle registration.
   (h)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. (ORC

   335.032 USE OF ELECTRONIC WIRELESS COMMUNICATION DEVICE PROHIBITED WHILE
DRIVING.
   (a)   No holder of a temporary instruction permit who has not attained the
age of eighteen years and no holder of a probationary driver’s license shall
drive a motor vehicle on any street, highway, or property used by the public
for purposes of vehicular traffic or parking while using in any manner an
electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to either of the
following:
      (1)   A person using an electronic wireless communications device for
emergency purposes, including an emergency contact with a law enforcement
agency, hospital or health care provider, fire department, or other similar
emergency agency or entity;

free manner who does not manipulate the device while driving.
   (c)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (c)(2) of this section, whoever

this section shall be fined three hundred dollars ($300.00).  In addition, the

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct.  However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

section, the court may order, for thirty days, the immobilization of the
vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license
plates.  If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio R.C.

in accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the
immobilization before the termination of the period of immobilization ordered
unless the court is presented with current proof of financial responsibility
with respect to that vehicle.
   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order.  The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination.  If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved.  When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section.  The
person charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may

liability arising from any injury or death sustained by the person who was
issued the affidavit due to the failure of the person to wear an occupant
restraining device unless the physician or chiropractor, in issuing the
affidavit, acted in a manner that constituted willful, wanton or reckless
misconduct.

Chapter 119, establishing a process for a person to be included in the database
under subsection (c)(5) of this section.  The information provided and included
in the database under subsection (c)(5) of this section is not a public record
subject to inspection or copying under Ohio R.C. 149.43.
   (d)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on
any street or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (b) hereof has been or is being
committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or summons for
a violation of that nature or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution
of a person for a violation of that nature, and no law enforcement officer
shall view the interior or visually inspect any automobile being operated on
any street or highway for the sole purpose of determining whether a violation

person to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant
restraining device in violation of subsection (b)(1) or (3) or the failure of a
person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an automobile being
operated by that person is wearing all of the available elements of a properly
adjusted occupant restraining device, in violation of subsection (b)(2)  of
this section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort
action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.  But the trier of
fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of
evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action
and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic
loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff's failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.  Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.     It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the
occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   (1)   Whoever violates subsection (b)(1) of this section shall be
fined thirty dollars ($30.00).

and storage fees normally imposed by the Municipality for towing and storing
motor vehicles.  If the motor vehicle is a leased vehicle, it shall not be
released to the lessee until the lessee presents proof that that person is the
lessee of the motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally
imposed by the Municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles.
         C.   If a person is charged with a violation of subsection (f)(1)A. of

   The following words and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the
meanings respectively ascribed to them:
   (a)   “Multi-space meter” means a device installed by the City for
acceptance of required parking fees for multiple parking spaces.  A multi-space
meter may control multiple parking spaces on-street (curbside, parallel, angled

or may require a patron to enter a space number in conjunction with making
payment.  Multi-space meters may accept one or more of the following payment
options: lawful coins of the United States, tokens, cash, credit cards, smart
cards or other stored value cards.  At all times, payment is required in
advance at any multi-space parking meter.
   (b)   “Multi-space meter space” means any parking space, designated or not,
in the vicinity of which a posted sign states the requirement for payment at a

space meter shall display brief directions as to its operation and the value of
lawful coin required to be deposited.
Each single-space meter shall contain a timing mechanism which shall indicate
either a balance of legal parking time or overtime parking by an appropriate
signal at the expiration of such lawful time.  At all times, payment is
required in advance at any single-space meter.
   (e)   “Single-space meter space” means a space within a single-space meter
area, which is designated for the parking of a single vehicle by marked lines
on the curb or a paved surface area adjacent to a single-space meter.  Posted
notice on the meter or on signs shall indicate the maximum consecutive parking
time limit during which a vehicle may be legally parked in a particular single-
space meter space and the days and hours when the requirement to deposit lawful
coin shall apply.

   355.01  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   (a)   General Finding. The Council finds, as a result of public testimony,
professional urban planning studies, and other evidence, that the continued
vitality of the City depends on the preservation of safe, healthy and
attractive neighborhoods. The Council further finds that the flight of
residents and property owners from the core area of cities can be traced in
part to the deterioration of such cities as attractive and comfortable places
in which to reside. The Council further finds that one fact that has
contributed to this deterioration in the City is the excessive and burdensome
practice of an over abundance of residents and non-residents in certain areas
and neighborhoods parking their motor vehicles for extended periods of time
therein. Since there is in the City at any time a large surplus of motor
vehicles over available on and off-street parking spaces, this condition
detracts from a healthy and complete urban environment. A system of
preferential resident parking will serve to reduce a number of strains on
residents of the City and thus promote the general public welfare.
   (b)   Specific Findings. The following specific legislative findings of the
Council in support of preferential resident parking are set forth as
illustrations of the need compelling the enactment of this Chapter. They are
intended as illustrations only and do not exhaust the subject of the factual
basis supporting its adoption:
      (1)    The safety, health and welfare of the residents of the City can be
greatly enhanced by the maintenance of the attractiveness, convenience and
livability of its neighborhoods and other residential areas;
      (2)    It is a fact of modern living in the City that a large portion of
municipal residents possess automobiles and as a result are daily faced with
the need to store these motor vehicles in or near their residences;
      (3)    Certain neighborhoods and areas of the City do not have sufficient
on or off-street space to accommodate the convenient parking of motor vehicles
by residents thereof in the vicinity of their homes;
      (4)    Such neighborhoods above are often further  burdened by influxes
of motor vehicles owned by non-residents which compete for the inadequate
availability of on-street parking spaces;
      (5)    There further exists certain parking "attractors" within the City,
such as Miami University, public schools, municipal facilities, business
facilities and the hospital which further exacerbate resident parking problems;
      (6)    Unnecessary vehicle miles, noise, pollution and strains on
interpersonal relationships caused by the conditions set forth herein work
unacceptable hardships on residents of these neighborhoods and other
residential areas by causing the deterioration of air quality, safety,
tranquility and other values available in an urban residential environment;
      (7)    If allowed to continue unchecked, these adverse effects on the
residents of the City will contribute to a further decline of the living
conditions therein, a reduction in the attractiveness of residing within said
City, and consequent injury to the general public welfare;
      (8)    A system of preferential resident parking as enacted in this
Chapter will serve to promote the safety, health and welfare of all the
residents of the City by reducing unnecessary personal motor vehicle travel,
noise and pollution, and by promoting improvements in air quality, the
convenience and attractiveness of urban residential living, and the increased
use of alternative forms of transportation. The public welfare will also be
served by ensuring a more stable and valuable property tax base in order to
generate the revenues necessary to provide essential public services.
         (Ord. 2580.  Passed 4-7-98.)
   355.02  DEFINITIONS.

valid permit as described herein shall be exempt from parking time restrictions
established pursuant to this Chapter;
 
   (d)   "Residential parking permit" shall mean a permit issued by the City to
allow a motor vehicle to be parked in a certain area within the City. "Parking

(Ord. 3371.  Passed 9-20-16.)
   355.03  DESIGNATION CRITERIA.
   (a)    A residential area shall be deemed eligible for consideration as a
residential permit parking area if based on surveys and studies prepared at the
direction of the City Manager, or designee, objective criteria establish that
the residential area is overcrowded with vehicles for any extended period
during the day or night, or weekends, or during holidays. Such objective
criteria shall include a minimum numerical standard for assessing overcrowded
parking throughout the City.
   (b)    In determining whether a residential area identified as eligible for
residential permit parking may be designated as a residential permit parking
area, the City Manager and the Council shall take into account factors which
include, but are not limited to the following.
      (1)    The on-street parking survey shall be conducted on at least three
separate days at some time during the hours for which the restricted parking is
being sought. The survey shall seek to determine whether at the time of the
survey:
         A.   At least 50% of the on-street parking spaces in the proposed
restricted parking block are occupied; or
         B.   At least 75% of the total number of on-street parking spaces in
the proposed restricted parking block are occupied by non-resident vehicles.
      (2)    If the survey shows that the on-street parking spaces are so
occupied (meeting either the 75% and 50% minimum occupancy test), the City
Manager shall certify this fact to the City Council along with any
recommendation he may have to whether Council should implement restricted
parking in the proposed restricted parking block.
         (Ord. 2580.  Passed 4-7-98.)
   355.04  DESIGNATION PROCESS.
   (a)   Upon receipt of a verified petition by residents of at least 60
residential living units in the residential area proposed for designation or
residents living in 51 percent of the residential living units in the area
proposed for designation, the City Manager or designee shall undertake or cause
to be undertaken such surveys or studies as are deemed necessary to determine
whether a residential area is eligible for residential permit parking. Each
residential living unit shall be limited to one signature per residential
living unit. Such surveys or studies shall be completed within 90 days of
receipt of a petition calling for such surveys or studies to be undertaken,
unless otherwise provided for by the Council.
   (b)   (1)   Within 30 days of the completion of surveys and studies to
determine whether designation criteria are met, the City Manager or designee
shall give notice as herein provided of a public hearing or hearings on the
subject of the eligibility of the residential area under consideration for
residential permit parking. Said hearing or hearings shall be conducted for the
purpose of ascertaining boundaries for the proposed residential permit parking
area and the hours of the permit.
      (2)   Notice of public hearing or hearings provided for herein shall be
published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City at least ten (10)
days before the hearing date and circularized generally in the neighborhood.
The notice shall clearly state the purpose of the hearing, the location and
boundaries tentatively considered for the proposed residential permit parking
area and, if applicable, the permit fee to be charged therefore.
   Residents within the boundary of the proposed residential permit parking

under an existing or former law of this State, another state, or the United
States or under an existing or former municipal ordinance.
   (d)   Any provision of the Codified Ordinances that refers to a section, or
to a division of a section, of the Codified Ordinances that defines or
specifies a criminal offense shall be construed to also refer to an existing or
former law of this State, another state, or the United States, to an existing
or former municipal ordinance, or to an existing or former division of any such
existing or former law or ordinance that defines or specifies, or that defined
or specified, a substantially equivalent offense. 
(ORC 2901.04)
   501.05  CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (a)    A person is subject to misdemeanor prosecution and punishment in this
Municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.
      (2)    While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this
State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction or activity in this Municipality.
      (5)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or

image, or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
   (b)   Notwithstanding the usual definition of the words “City” and
“Municipality”, and notwithstanding any limited words of any particular
provision of this Code, all police regulations and criminal offense provisions
contained in the Code of the City of Oxford, or contained within the Revised
Code of the State of Ohio, shall apply on all lands and to all lands owned by
the City of Oxford and situated outside the corporate limits of said City, to
the full extent authorized by the statutes of this State.  The criminal law of
the State of Ohio and of the City of Oxford shall be the regulations and law in
effect in and upon all Municipally owned real estate.
(Ord. 1495.  Passed 12-5-78.)
   (c)   In homicide, the element referred to in subsection (a)(1) hereof is
either the act that causes death, or the physical contact that causes death, or
the death itself.  If any part of the body of a homicide victim is found in
this Municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within this
Municipality.
   (d)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.  Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (e)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (f)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (g)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (h)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (i)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (j)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01.
(ORC 2901.11)
   501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)    The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
   501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. 
(ORC 2923.02)
   501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. 
(ORC 2901.24)
   501.13  CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;

   501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
         The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case
file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the
payment terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it
may modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
(ORC 2929.28)
(b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
   A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred eighty
days;
   B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
   C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
   D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of                                       Maximum
Misdemeanor                                     Fine 
First degree                                        $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00

Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section

501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal

involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series. 
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

part of which are written off as bad debt but subsequently collected, less the
expenses of their collection shall be included in gross revenue in the quarter
collected;
         C.   Late payment charges;
         D.   Maintenance charges;
         E.   Charges for services other than video service, reasonably
identifiable on books or records the Video Service Provider keeps in the

same number of days to the next business day.
   (b)    The following procedure and schedule shall be followed for
transmission of water utility bills to customers, and customers' payment of
utility bills:
   FIRST OF THE MONTH- bills are mailed
   18th Of The Month- the net amount of the bill is due on the 18th. If the net
amount is not paid in full on or before the 18th, the gross amount will be due
on the 19th. The gross amount is considered the "Past Due" amount, if not
received by the 19th.
   FIRST OF THE NEXT (SECOND) MONTH - the second month's bill is issued and
indicates the current amount due plus the amount of arrearage (past due
amount), and therefore serves as a past due notice. Any partial payment is
first applied to the oldest unpaid balance.
   18th OF THE SECOND MONTH- the first month's bill is now approximately 30
days past due, and the current month's bill is now due. If any portion of the
prior month's past due amount remains unpaid at the close of business on the
18th, a termination of service (shut off) notice will be mailed on the 19th
notifying the customer that the Past Due portion must be received in the
utility office before 5:00 p.m. on the 28th.
   28th OF THE SECOND MONTH- This is the customer's last day before termination
notice to pay the full Past Due amount, or to contact the City to discuss a
good faith dispute of the bill or enter into a Utility Payment Agreement with
the City.
   29th OF THE SECOND MONTH - the fourth and final notice will be in the form
of a door hanger left at the service address after the 28th (as scheduling
permits). If the full Past Due amount from the first month is not received in
the utility billing office by 12:00 p.m. (noon) the following business day,
water utility service will be terminated.

the excess concentration in any or all, as the case may be, shall be subject to
a surcharge as follows:
      (1)    Pounds of excess suspended solids as listed in the current Fee
Ordinance.
      (2)    Pounds of excess biochemical oxygen demand as listed in the
current Fee Ordinance.
      (3)    Pounds of excess oil and grease as listed in the current Fee
Ordinance.
   (d)   (1)   Addition to the surcharge, the user will pay the user charges as
defined and set forth previously in this code.
      (2)   The pounds of biochemical oxygen demand, pounds of suspended solids
and pounds of oil and grease per day, above the concentrations previously
described for normal strength wastewater that are discharged to the wastewater
treatment system, shall be determined by the City or their authorized
representative.
      (3)   In addition to the surcharge on biochemical oxygen demand,
suspended solids and oil and grease, the City shall have the right to surcharge
any user for the discharge of any other pollutant into the wastewater system or
for any other reason it deems necessary and appropriate, such as excessively
high rates of discharge, requirements of special equipment or monitoring and
other special circumstances.
   (e)    Any commercial user, as defined in this code, that serves or prepares
food for human consumption shall pay a surcharge as per the current Fee
Ordinance for 100 cubic feet of metered water consumption.
   (f)   Commercial user surcharges have been determined based upon sampling of
the sewer system and the resulting conclusion that commercial users serving or
preparing food in fact exceed the normal wastewater standard for oil and grease
as set forth in this code.
   (g)   (1)   Any commercial user that estimates that such user discharges an
amount of oil and grease that is less than 20 parts per million shall have the
option, at said user's expense, of installing a sampling manhole at a location,
and constructed according to specifications, approved by the City Engineer.
      (2)   Whenever such a sampling manhole has been installed and approved by
the City Engineer, the City shall take samples from such manhole at least once
every three months provided said user shall have made such a request and shall
have paid a sampling fee as per the current Fee Ordinance, payable for each
such sampling request to the Finance Director.
      (3)   If the City sampling indicates said user to be exceeding 20 parts
per million of oil and grease discharge, then such user shall pay a surcharge
at the rate as per the current fee ordinance until such time as subsequent
sampling, at the request and expense of said user or at the option and expense
of the City, indicates said user to be discharging normal wastewater as defined
in this code.
      (4)   If said City sampling indicates said user to be discharging 20
parts per million or less of oil and grease, then no surcharge will be assessed
until such time as subsequent sampling, at the option and expense of the City,
indicates a necessity for a surcharge due to a discharge of oil and grease in
excess of 20 parts per million.

within the City, said user shall complete and file with the City a
"pretreatment wastewater questionnaire" as supplied by the City and no building
permit shall be issued and no water service shall be supplied to any such
industrial user until the required pretreatment survey questionnaire has been
satisfactorily completed and filed.
(Ord. 3261.  Passed 12-17-13.)
   923.45  NONACCEPTABLE WASTEWATER AND INDUSTRIAL PRETREATMENT.
   (a)    The City shall make and enforce rules and regulations establishing
the types and characteristics of wastewater, industrial wastes and other
matters which shall be discharged into the sanitary sewerage system, the types
and characteristics of wastewater and industrial wastes admissible to the
system only after pretreatment, requisites for pretreatment, and otherwise
governing the discharge of wastewater, industrial wastes and other matters into
the system in interest of safety and efficient operation of the wastewater
treatment plant. Applicable industrial pretreatment conditions and industrial
pretreatment regulation, as promulgated under Section 307(b) and (c) of the
Clean Water Act, are hereby incorporated in this chapter and made a part
thereof. National Categorical Pretreatment Standards, as promulgated by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and as adopted hereinafter, shall be met
by all discharges of the regulated industrial categories. An application for
modification of the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards may be
considered for submittal to the regional administrator by the authority when
the authority's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of the
pollutants as defined by 40 Code of Federal Regulations 403.7.
   (b)    An industry must, upon application for sewer service, present to the
City a tabulation of the chemical analysis of the wastes to be discharged to
wastewater system and the volume of such wastes, or if this is not available,
the expected waste analysis based upon similar processes now in operation.
   (c)    In cases where the character of wastewater or industrial waste from
any manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises is such that it
will damage the sewerage system or cannot be treated satisfactorily at the
wastewater treatment plant, the City shall compel such users to dispose of such
waste and prevent it from entering the sewerage system.
   (d)    In cases where the character of the wastewater or industrial waste
from any manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises is such that
it imposes an unreasonable burden upon the wastewater collection, pumping or
treatment works greater than that imposed by the average wastewater entering
the sewerage system, the City may: Compel such manufacturing or industrial
plant, building or premises to pretreat such wastewater in such manner as
specified by the City before discharging it into the sewerage system; require
flow control or equalization of such wastes so as to avoid any slug loads or
excessive loads that may be harmful to the treatment work; and/or require
payment of a surcharge on any such flows or loadings discharged to the
treatment works to cover the additional costs of having capacity for and
treating such wastes.
   (e)    The discharge of non-acceptable industrial wastewater into the
sewerage system, whether directly or indirectly, is prohibited. Wastewater
shall be deemed non-acceptable when the concentration of harmful or toxic
substances in the wastewater exceeds certain prescribed tolerable limits. Toxic
or harmful substances include, but are not necessarily limited to, the
following:

   The preceding list of toxic or harmful substances is subject to revision as
required to meet current water quality standards imposed by state or federal
agencies. In special cases involving low volume users, the concentration of
toxic or harmful substances in the wastewater may be exceeded if it is
determined by the City that the total pounds of toxic or harmful substances
discharged to the wastewater system are not harmful to or will not interfere
with the wastewater treatment process or will not violate water quality or
effluent standards.

on analysis, an average of 50 milligrams per liter of oil or grease determined
as total soluble matter.
      (8)    Any garbage that has not been properly shredded to a degree that
all particles will be carried freely under the flow conditions of the sewer and
with no particle greater than 1/2 inch in any dimension.
      (9)    Any water or wastes containing suspended solids of such character
or quality that unusual attention or expense is required to handle such
materials at the wastewater treatment plant, or having a chlorine demand
greater than 25 parts per million.
      (10)    Any water or wastes discharged in large enough quantities to
cause a violation of the City's NPDES permit or to make the sludge unsuitable
for reclamation.
      (11)    Any water or wastes discharged in large enough quantities to
cause the effluent from the treatment works to be objectionably colored.
      (12)    Radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration
as may exceed limits in compliance with applicable state or federal
regulations.
      (13)    Any slug load which shall mean any pollutant including oxygen
demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.) released in a single extraordinary discharge
episode of such volume or strength as to cause interference with or to the
publicly-owned treatment works.
   The above list is subject to revisions as required to meet current water
quality standards imposed by the state or federal agencies.
   (g)    No statement contained in this section shall be interpreted as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the City and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the City for treatment. In all such cases, the provisions
set forth in this code establishing sewer service charges will be governing
factors in any contracts entered into, and no special agreement between the
City and any industrial concern shall violate any pretreatment standards and
requirements.
   (h)    (1)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in
the opinion of the City of Oxford and/or the Butler County Health Department
they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease
in excessive amounts or any flammable wastes, sand and other harmful
ingredients except that such interceptors shall not be required for private
living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be located as to be
readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
      (2)   Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious

discharged any storm water, ground water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, to
any sanitary sewer.
   (d)    It shall be unlawful to discharge into the building sanitary sewer
the surface water which collects in basement or foundation excavations. If the
building sanitary sewer is complete before the plumbing can be connected
thereto, the builder or sewer tapper shall keep the end of the building
sanitary sewer tightly closed with a plumber's plug or other watertight plug.
   (e)    The owner(s) of all houses, buildings or properties used for human
occupancy, employment, recreation or other purposes, situated within the City
and abutting on any street, alley or right-of-way in which there is now located
or may in the future be located a public sanitary sewer of the City, is hereby
required at the owner's expense to install suitable toilet facilities therein
and to connect such facilities directly to the proper public sewer in
accordance with the rules and regulations within 90 days after date of official
notice to do so.
   (f)    No person, firm or corporation shall be permitted to connect to or
discharge wastewater to the Oxford, Ohio wastewater system unless it has been
determined by the City that there is sufficient capacity in the system to
collect, convey and treat the proposed wastewater discharge of such person,
firm or corporation.
   (g)    No user shall ever increase the use of process water or attempt to
dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment
to achieve compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards or any other
standard developed by the State or City.
   (h)    Upon the promulgation of Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards
for a particular industry, the federal standard, if more stringent, shall
supersede the limitations imposed under this ordinance. All affected users
shall be notified of applicable reporting requirements, reports and compliance
dates.
(Ord. 3261.  Passed 12-17-13.)
   923.47  WASTEWATER MONITORING AND INSPECTION.
   (a)    All industrial users who discharge or propose to discharge
wastewaters to the wastewater treatment system shall maintain such records of

accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
Construction shall be completed within 120 days of receipt of permit by
discharger.
   (d)    The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the
industrial user's premises outside of the building. When such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the City may allow such
facility to be constructed in the public right-of-way, with the approval of the
public agency having jurisdiction of such right-of-way, and located so that it
will not be obstructed by public utilities, landscaping or parked vehicles.
   (e)    When more than one user can discharge into a common sewer, the City
may require installation of separate monitoring equipment for each user. When
there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and
characteristics produced by different operations of a single user, the City may
require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each discharge.
   (f)    Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with City requirements and all
applicable construction standards and specifications.
   (g)    Compliance determinations with respect to the prohibitions and
limitations contained in this chapter may be made on the basis of either
instantaneous grab samples or composite samples of wastewater. Composite
samples may be taken over a 24-hour period or over a longer or shorter time
span as determined necessary by the City in order to meet the needs of specific
circumstances.
   (h)    Laboratory analysis of industrial wastewater samples shall be
performed in accordance with the current edition of "Standards Methods",
"Method for Chemical Analysis of Water and Waste" published by the U.S. EPA or
the "Annual Book of Standards, Part 23, Water, Atmospheric Analysis" published
by the American Society for Testing and Materials. Analysis of those pollutants
not covered by these publications shall be performed in accordance with
procedures established by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio EPA).
In addition, all measurements, tests and analysis of the characteristics of
wastewater shall also be made in conformance with the most current Federal
Register (40 CFR Part 136) entitled "Guidelines for Establishing Test
Procedures for the Analysis of Pollutants".
   (i)    Sampling of industrial wastewater for the purpose of compliance
determination with respect to the prohibitions and limitations contained in
this chapter will be done at such intervals as designated by the City. All
records of sampling and similar information shall be kept for a period of at
least three years.
   (j)    Duly authorized employees of the City bearing proper credentials and
identifications shall be permitted to enter all properties for the purposes of
inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and testing pertinent to
discharge to the community system in accordance with the provision of this
chapter.
   (k)    Duly authorized employees of the City are authorized to obtain
information concerning industrial processes which have a direct bearing on the
kind of source of discharge to the wastewater collection system. The industry
may withhold information considered confidential provided the industry
establishes that revealing such information to the public might result in an
advantage to competitors.
   (1)    While performing necessary work for private properties referred to in
subsection (j) hereof, the City or duly authorized employees of the City shall
observe all safety rules applicable to the premises. (Ord. 3261.  Passed 12-17-

   (a)    Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this chapter.
Facilities to prevent accidental discharge or prohibited materials shall be
provided and maintained at the owner's or operator's own cost and expense.
Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to the City for review and shall be approved by
the City before construction of the facility. Review and approval of such plans
and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify his facility as necessary to meet the requirements of
this chapter.
   (b)    If for any reason a facility does not comply with or will be unable
to comply with any prohibition or limitations in this chapter, the facility
responsible for such discharge shall immediately notify the City so that
corrective action may be taken to protect the treatment system. In addition, a
written report addressed to the City detailing the date, time and cause of the
accidental discharge, the quantity and characteristics of the discharge and
corrective action taken to prevent future discharges shall be filed by the
responsible industrial facility within five days of the occurrence of the non-
complying discharge. (Ord. 3261.  Passed 12-17-13.)
   923.99  PENALTIES AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)    Whenever the City determines that any person has violated or is
violating any prohibition, limitation or provisions of this chapter, they may
serve upon such person a written notice stating the nature of the violation and
providing a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days for a satisfactory
correction thereof. Such notice shall also state that any person in violation
of this code shall be liable for any resulting damages at the rates listed in
the current City of Oxford Fee Ordinance or applicable fines.
   The City may, for good cause shown, suspend wastewater treatment service and
the wastewater discharge permit of a discharger when it appears to the City
that an actual or threatened discharge presents or threatens an imminent or
substantial danger to the health or welfare of person or environment,
interferes with operation of the publicly operated treatment works, or violates
any pretreatment limits imposed by this chapter or any wastewater discharge
permit issued pursuant to this chapter. Any discharger notified of the
suspension of the City's wastewater treatment service and/or the discharger's
wastewater discharge permit shall within a reasonable period of time, as
determined by the City, cease all discharges. In the event of failure of the
discharger to comply voluntarily with the suspension order within the specified
time, the City shall commence judicial proceeding immediately thereafter to
complete the discharger's compliance with such order. The City shall reinstate
the wastewater discharge permit and/or the wastewater treatment service and
terminate judicial proceedings pending proof by the discharger of the
elimination of the non-complying discharge or conditions creating the threat of
imminent or substantial danger as set forth above.
   (b)    Whenever the City determines that any person has violated or is
violating any prohibition, limitation or provision of this chapter, the City
may terminate water and sewer service.
   (c)    After the City Manager has reviewed the facts, he may issue an order
to the party responsible directing that, following a specified time period, the
water and sewer service be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities,
devices or other related appurtenances shall have been installed or existing
treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are properly
operated and such further orders and directives as are necessary and
appropriate.
   (d)    At the end of each calendar year, the City will publish a list of all

applicable pretreatment standards and requirement may not be eligible to
receive a contractual award for the sale of goods or services to the City of
Oxford. Existing contracts for the sale of goods or services to the City of
Oxford held by a user found to be in significant noncompliance with
pretreatment standards or requirements may be terminated at the discretion of
the Service Director.
      (7)   Penalties for Prohibited Wastewater Discharges.  In addition to all
the enforcement mechanisms in this section, each industrial user found to be in
noncompliance will be subject to charges for the handling, treatment, removal,
and disposal of all identified, prohibited materials or conditions that are
discharged to the public sewer system prior to the corrections being made. Such

provided for in this chapter, shall be deposited as received by the Finance
Director, who shall keep the same in a separate fund designated Water Capacity
Benefit Fund.  The funds may be invested in interest bearing accounts until
used.  Subject to the provisions of any ordinance or indenture of mortgage
authorizing and securing the issuance of mortgage revenue bonds for the
treatment plant, moneys in the fund shall only be used for capital improvements
for the water treatment plant and works.
   (c)   Maintenance of Records.  The Finance Director shall maintain and keep

provide an annual accounting for each Capacity Benefit Permit account showing
the source and amount of all funds collected and the projects that were
funded. 
(Ord. 2414. Passed 8-15-95.)
   924.09  ANNUAL REVIEW AND MODIFICATION.
   (a)   The Authorities having jurisdiction shall annually, in conjunction
with the annual capital budget and  capital improvements plan adoption
processes, review the development potential of the subarea and the capital
improvements plan and make such modifications as are deemed necessary as a
result of:
      (1)   Development occurring in the prior year;
      (2)   Capital improvements actually constructed;
      (3)   Changing facility needs;
      (4)   Inflation;
      (5)   Revised cost estimates for capital improvements;
      (6)   Changes in the availability of other funding sources applicable to
public facility projects; and
      (7)   Such other factors as may be relevant.
   (b)   Modifications to the development potential, the capital improvements
program, and the Capacity Benefit Permit coefficients shall be recommended for
adoption prior to March of each year and shall be effective on the first date
allowable by law.
   (c)   Modifications deemed to be necessary as a result of unforeseen
circumstances or to ensure the equitable and proportionate application of the
Capacity Benefit Permits, may be made during the course of the year subject to
approval by Council and proper public notice in the manner provided for by
Municipal regulations.
   (d)   Failure of the Authorities to review, as provided herein, shall not
effect the enforcement and application of this chapter. 
(Ord. 2414. Passed 8-15-95.)
   924.10  IMPOSITION OF CAPACITY BENEFIT PERMIT.
   (a)   No permit shall be issued for a development in a designated
development subarea as herein defined unless the Capacity Benefit Permit is
imposed and calculated pursuant to this chapter; and payment thereof shall be
included as a standard condition of municipal approval for any Planned Unit
Development, subdivision, or other site development approval.
   (b)   Capacity Benefit Permits shall not exceed the cost of providing
capital improvements for which the need is reasonably attributable to those
developments that pay the Capacity Benefit Permit.  The funds shall be spent on
new or enlarged capital improvements that reasonably benefit those developments
that pay the Capacity Benefit Permits.
   (c)   Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, Capacity Benefit
Permits also may include a proportionate assessment for the cost of existing
capital improvements serving new development.  To determine an equitable
assessment for such existing capital facilities and infrastructure, the
following factors shall be considered:
      (1)   The need for new facilities to serve new development based on a
capital improvements plan that shows:
         A.   Any deficiencies in existing facilities that serve existing
development and the means by which existing development will be assessed and
assessments used to make up such deficiencies, and
         B.   Any capital improvements that are attributable to the demands
placed on specified facilities by new development;
      (2)   The need for Capacity Benefit Permits funds considering the
availability of other means to fund capital improvements including, but not
limited to, user charges, taxes, intergovernmental transfers and other revenue,
and special taxation or assessment districts;
      (3)   The cost of existing capital improvements;
      (4)   The method by which the existing capital improvements were
financed;
      (5)   The extent to which developments paying the Capacity Benefit Permit
already have contributed to the cost of the existing facility and the credit
against Capacity Benefit Permits that may be due therefrom;
      (6)   The extent to which new development will contribute to the cost of
the existing facility in the future (i.e., user fees, debt payments, or
proportion of future taxes reasonably expected to be used for future capital
costs) and the credit against Capacity Benefit Permits that may be due
therefrom;
      (7)   The extent to which new development is required as a condition of
approval to construct facilities that substantially benefit other development
and the credit against Capacity Benefit Permits that may be due therefrom; and
      (8)   The time-price differential inherent in comparisons of amounts paid
and benefits received at different times and the credit against or reduction in
Capacity Benefit Permits that may be due therefrom.
   (d)   That portion of Capacity Benefit Permit revenues reasonably
attributable to the equitable assessment described in subsection (f) of this
section may be spent on new or enlarged capital improvements that will
reasonably benefit anticipated future development rather than those
developments that have paid for Capacity Benefit Permits.
   (e)   Capacity Benefit Permits that are assessed against new development
shall be assessed in such a manner that any new development having the same
impact on capital facilities shall be assessed the same Capacity Benefit
Permit.
   (f)   In order to minimize the effect of Capacity Benefit Permits funds on
the cost of new development, the following mechanism, or one achieving the same
effect, may be used, at the sole discretion of Council, to delay payment of
Capacity Benefit Permits for construction of buildings against which fees are
to be assessed.
      (1)   The fee shall be assessed against the parcel of real property on
which the building is to be sited.  A notice of the Permit, including the
amount owed, shall be recorded in the appropriate real property title records.
      (2)   The Water Treatment Plant Capacity Benefit Permit assessment shall
become due and payable at the time the normal sanitary sewer tap-in fee is paid
for the subject building. 
(Ord. 2414. Passed 8-15-95.)
   924.11  CALCULATION OF CAPACITY BENEFIT PERMIT.
   (a)   "Equivalent dwelling unit" means, in the context of the Water Capacity
Benefit Permit, the cumulative total of plumbing fixtures units, (as defined in
the Ohio Plumbing Code), considering type, size and quantity, which are
generally equivalent to the average total of plumbing fixture units found in a
typical single family house (a total of 20 plumbing fixture units).  One single
family dwelling unit equals one "residential dwelling unit" and shall be
treated as one equivalent dwelling unit.
   (b)   The Municipality shall calculate the amount of the applicable Capacity
Benefit Permit due for each permit by:
      (1)   Determining the applicable designated development area;
      (2)   Verifying the number and type of residential dwelling units,
equivalent dwelling units in the case of nonresidential development, or other
unit of measure as may be applicable, for which each permit is sought;
      (3)   Determining the applicable per unit Capacity Benefit Permit; and
      (4)   Multiplying the applicable per unit Capacity Benefit Permit by
         A.   The appropriate number of residential dwelling units or
         B.   The equivalent dwelling units calculated for nonresidential
development.
         C.   Other unit of measure as may be applicable.
   (c)   If the development for which a permit is sought contains a mix of
uses, the Municipality must separately calculate the Capacity Benefit Permit
due for each type of development.
   (d)   Prior to making an application for a permit, an applicant may request
a nonbinding Capacity Benefit Permit estimate from the Municipality, which
shall base such estimate on the development potential of the particular site in
equivalent dwelling units given the maximum intensity permitted by existing
zoning and the applicable Capacity Benefit Permit coefficient. 
(Ord. 2414. Passed 8-15-95.)
   924.12  ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT SUBAREA.
   The principal reason for identifying a development area or combination of
development areas is to ensure that development areas projected to experience
significant development in the future will be served adequately by necessary
capital improvements.  Development subareas are established as shown on the
Development Subareas Map.
   (a)   Such development subareas will be established by separate action of
Council consistent with facility service areas established in the capital
improvements plan for each capital improvement.  Such areas will provide a
nexus between those paying the Permits and benefits received to ensure that
those developments paying Capacity Benefit Permits receive substantial
benefits.
   (b)   Additional development subareas or combinations of development
subareas may be designated by Council as development areas consistent with the
procedure set forth in this chapter.  The Council must consider the following
factors in determining when and whether to add development areas:
      (1)   The comprehensive plan.
      (2)   Any standards of adequate public facilities incorporated in the
capital improvements plan.
      (3)   The projected full development as permitted by land use ordinances
and timing of development areas.
      (4)   The need for and cost of unprogrammed capital improvements
necessary to support projected development.
      (5)   Such other factors as Council may deem relevant.
   (c)   The designated development subarea for the Water Treatment Plant
Capacity Benefit Permit shall be all lands within the corporate limits of the
City, and any land annexed in the future shall be included in the subarea.
      (Ord. 2414. Passed 8-15-95.)
   924.14  CAPACITY BENEFIT PERMIT COEFFICIENTS.
   (EDITOR’S NOTE: See Section 921.37(h).)
   924.15  BONDING OF EXCESS FACILITY PROJECTS.
   The Municipality may issue bonds, revenue certificates, and other
obligations of indebtedness in such manner and subject to such limitations as
may be provided by law in furtherance of the provision of capital improvement
projects.  Funds pledged toward retirement of bonds, revenue certificates, or
other obligations of indebtedness for such projects may include Capacity
Benefit Permits and other Municipal revenues as may be allocated by Council. 
Capacity Benefit Permits paid pursuant to this chapter, however, shall be
restricted to use solely and exclusively for financing directly, or as a pledge
against bonds, revenue certificates, and other obligations of indebtedness for
the cost of capital improvements as specified herein. 
(Ord. 2414. Passed 8-15-95.)
   924.16  EFFECT OF CAPACITY BENEFIT PERMIT ON OTHER MUNICIPAL REGULATION.
   This chapter shall not affect, in any manner, the permissible use of
property, density of development, design and improvements standards and
requirements, or any other aspect of the development of land or provision or
capital improvements subject to the planning and zoning regulations or other
regulations of the Municipality, which shall be operative and remain in full
force and effect without limitation with respect to all such development.
(Ord. 2414. Passed 8-15-95.)
   924.17  CAPACITY BENEFIT PERMIT IS ADDITIONAL AND SUPPLEMENTAL REQUIREMENT.
   (a)   The Capacity Benefit Permit is additional and supplemental to, and not
in substitution of, any other requirements imposed by the Municipality on the
development of land or the issuance of permits.  It is intended to be
consistent with and to further the objectives and policies of the comprehensive
plan, the capital improvements plan, and other municipal policies, ordinances,
and resolutions by which the City seeks to ensure the provision of public
facilities in conjunction with the development of land.
   (b)   In no event shall a property owner be obligated to pay for capital
improvements in an amount in excess of the amount calculated pursuant to this
chapter; but, provided that property owner may be required to pay, pursuant to
Municipal ordinances, regulations, or policies, for other capital improvements
in addition to the Capacity Benefit Permit for capital improvements as
specified herein. 
(Ord. 2414. Passed 8-15-95.)
   924.18  DELINQUENT ACCOUNT ACTIONS.
   (a)   Charges are a Lien.  Permits charged pursuant to this chapter are
hereby made a lien upon the premises subject to the application for permit.  If
such Permits are not paid within thirty days after the Permits become due and
payable, the Finance Director, at the direction of the City Manager, may
certify the amount for such fees to the County Auditor.  The Auditor shall
place same upon the tax duplicate with interest at the highest rate allowable
by Ohio statutes and cause such amount to be collected as other Municipal taxes
are collected.  The effective date for such lien shall be upon the date of
certification to the County Auditor.
   (b)   Suspension of Plan Reviews and Application Processing.  No plans or
other submittal documents shall be accepted for review and/or processing, and
the review of documents or processing of any application which is already in
progress shall cease, if the applicant has failed to pay any fees which are due
and payable to the Municipality in accordance with this chapter or other
Municipal regulations.
   (c)   Interest Rate on Unpaid Permits.  Any Capacity Benefit Permit due and
owing the Municipality shall bear interest at the highest rate allowable by law
per annum, if such amount is not paid within thirty days of invoice date. 
(Ord. 2414. Passed 8-15-95.)
   924.19  PERMIT ISSUANCE.
   No permit shall be issued by any agency or person acting for the
Municipality until all charges and Permits required by Municipal regulations,
and which are due and payable, have been paid in full.  This section takes
precedence over any other section of the Codified Ordinances requiring that any
permit or approval be issued within a limited or set amount of time.

Capacity Benefit Permits, may be made during the course of the year subject to
approval by Council and proper public notice in the manner provided for by
Municipal regulations.
   (d)   Failure of the Authorities to review, as provided herein, shall not
effect the enforcement and application of this chapter.
(Ord. 2415.  Passed 8-15-95.)
   925.10  IMPOSITION OF CAPACITY BENEFIT PERMIT.
   (a)   No permit shall be issued for a development in a designated
development subarea as herein defined unless the Capacity Benefit Permit is
imposed and calculated pursuant to this chapter; and payment thereof shall be
included as a standard condition of municipal approval for any Planned Unit
Development, subdivision, or other site development approval.
   (b)   Capacity Benefit Permits shall not exceed the cost of providing
capital improvements for which the need is reasonably attributable to those
developments that pay the Capacity Benefit Permit.  The funds shall be spent on
new or enlarged capital improvements that reasonably benefit those developments
that pay the Capacity Benefit Permits.
   (c)   Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, Capacity Benefit
Permits also may include a proportionate assessment for the cost of existing
capital improvements serving new development.  To determine an equitable
assessment for such existing capital facilities and infrastructure, the
following factors shall be considered:
      (1)   The need for new facilities to serve new development based on a
capital improvements plan that shows:
         A.   Any deficiencies in existing facilities that serve existing
development and the means by which existing development will be assessed and
assessments used to make up such deficiencies; and
         B.   Any capital improvements that are attributable to the demands
placed on specified facilities by new development;
      (2)   The need for Capacity Benefit Permits funds considering the
availability of other means to fund capital improvements including, but not
limited to, user charges, taxes, intergovernmental transfers and other revenue,
and special taxation or assessment districts;
      (3)   The cost of existing capital improvements;
      (4)   The method by which the existing capital improvements were
financed;
      (5)   The extent to which developments paying the Capacity Benefit Permit
already have contributed to the cost of the existing facility and the credit
against Capacity Benefit Permits that may be due therefrom;
      (6)   The extent to which new development will contribute to the cost of
the existing facility in the future (i.e., user fees, debt payments, or
proportion of future taxes reasonably expected to be used for future capital
costs) and the credit against Capacity Benefit Permits that may be due
therefrom;
      (7)   The extent to which new development is required as a condition of
approval to construct facilities that substantially benefit other development
an the credit against Capacity Benefit Permits that may be due therefrom; and
      (8)   The time-price differential inherent in comparisons of amounts paid
and benefits received at different times and the credit against or reduction in
Capacity Benefit Permits that may be due therefrom.
   (d)   That portion of Capacity Benefit Permit revenues reasonably
attributable to the equitable assessment described in subsection (f) of this
section may be spent on new or enlarged capital improvements that will
reasonably benefit anticipated future development rather than those
developments that have paid for Capacity Benefit Permits.
   (e)   Capacity Benefit Permits that are assessed against new development
shall be assessed in such a manner that any new development having the same
impacts on capital facilities shall be assessed the same Capacity Benefit
Permit.
   (f)   In order to minimize the effect of Capacity Benefit Permits funds on
the cost of new development, the following mechanism, or one achieving the same
effect, may be used, at the sole discretion of Council, to delay payment of
Capacity Benefit Permits for construction of buildings against which fees are
to be assessed.
      (1)   The fee shall be assessed against the parcel of real property on
which the building is to be sited.  A notice of the Permit, including the
amount owed, shall be recorded in the appropriate real property title records.
      (2)   The Wastewater Treatment Plant Capacity Benefit Permit assessment
shall become due and payable at the time the normal sanitary sewer tap-in fee
is paid for the subject building. 
(Ord. 2415.  Passed 8-15-95.)
   925.11  CALCULATION OF CAPACITY BENEFIT PERMIT.
   (a)   Equivalent dwelling unit means, in the context of the Wastewater
Capacity Benefit Permit, the cumulative total of plumbing fixtures units, (as
defined in the Ohio Plumbing Code), considering type, size and quantity, which
are generally equivalent to the average total of plumbing fixture units found
in a typical single family house (a total of 20 plumbing fixture units).  One
single family dwelling unit equals one “residential dwelling unit” and shall be
treated as one equivalent dwelling unit.
   (b)   The Municipality shall calculate the amount of the applicable Capacity
Benefit Permit due for each permit by:
      (1)   Determining the applicable designated development area;
      (2)   Verifying the number and type of residential dwelling units,
equivalent dwelling units in the case of nonresidential development, or other
unit of measure as may be applicable, for which each permit is sought;
      (3)   Determining the applicable per unit Capacity Benefit Permit; and
      (4)   Multiplying the applicable per unit Capacity Benefit Permit by:
         A.   The appropriate number of residential dwelling units or
         B.   The equivalent dwelling units calculated for nonresidential
development.
         C.   Other unit of measure as may be applicable.
   (c)   If the development for which a permit is sought contains a mix of
uses, the Municipality must separately calculate the Capacity Benefit Permit
due for each type of development.
   (d)   Prior to making an application for a permit, an applicant may request
a nonbinding Capacity Benefit Permit estimate from the Municipality, which
shall base such estimate on the development potential of the particular site in
equivalent dwelling units given the maximum intensity permitted by existing
zoning and the applicable Capacity Benefit Permit coefficient.
(Ord. 2415.  Passed 8-15-95.)
   925.12  ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT SUBAREA.
   The principal reason for identifying a development area or combination of
development areas is to ensure that development areas projected to experience
significant development in the future will be served adequately by necessary
capital improvements.  Development subareas are established as shown on the
Development Subareas Map.
   (a)   Such development subareas will be established by separate action of
Council consistent with facility service areas established in the capital
improvements plan for each capital improvement.  Such areas will provide a
nexus between those paying the Permits and benefits received to ensure that
those developments paying Capacity Benefit Permits receive substantial
benefits.
   (b)   Additional development subareas or combinations of development
subareas may be designated by Council as development areas consistent with the
procedure set forth in this ordinance.  The Council must consider the following
factors in determining when and whether to add development areas:
      (1)   The comprehensive plan.
      (2)   Any standards of adequate public facilities incorporated in the
capital improvements plan.
      (3)   The projected full development as permitted by land use ordinances
and timing of development areas.
      (4)   The need for and cost of unprogrammed capital improvements
necessary to support projected development.
      (5)   Such other factors as Council may deem relevant.
   (c)   The designated development subarea for the Wastewater Treatment Plant
Capacity Benefit Permit shall be all lands within the corporate limits of the
City of Oxford, Ohio, and any land annexed in the future shall be included in
the subarea.

regulations of the Municipality, which shall be operative and remain in full
force and effect without limitation with respect to all such development.
(Ord. 2415.  Passed 8-15-95.)
   925.17  CAPACITY BENEFIT PERMIT IS ADDITIONAL AND SUPPLEMENTAL REQUIREMENT.
   (a)   The Capacity Benefit Permit is additional and supplemental to, and not
in substitution of, any other requirements imposed by the Municipality on the
development of land or the issuance of permits.  It is intended to be
consistent with and to further the objectives and policies of the comprehensive
plan, the capital improvements plan, and other municipal policies, ordinances,
and resolutions by which the City seeks to ensure the provision of public
facilities in conjunction with the development of land.
   (b)   In no event shall a property owner be obligated to pay for capital
improvements in an amount in excess of the amount calculated pursuant to this
chapter; but, provided that property owner may be required to pay, pursuant to
Municipal ordinances, regulations or policies, for other capital improvements
in addition to the Capacity Benefit Permit for capital improvements as
specified herein. 
(Ord. 2415.  Passed 8-15-95.)

CROSS REFERENCES
Land appropriation for parks - see Ohio R.C. 715.21, 719.01
   937.01  MEMORIALS AND TRIBUTES IN PARKS.
   (a)   City Parks are a scarce resource provided for active recreational use
and passive celebration of natural beauty by the general public.  The City
Council recognizes the desires of members of the public to memorialize or pay
tribute to deceased friends or relatives at or in conjunction with a favorite
park or recreational activity.  The Council believes that placement of
memorials or tributes to private individuals in City parks must be governed by
a policy that preserves a positive experience for the public in the park,
ensures that all costs of a memorial or tribute are borne by those requesting
it, and provides a net benefit to park users.
   The following types of memorials are authorized on the following conditions,
subject to specific approval that shall be given on a case by case basis
consistent with the foregoing policy:
      (1)   For a minimum contribution of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) to the
Parks and Recreation Gift Fund, a memorial certificate may be provided to the
family or friend and the gift may be acknowledged in an annual report kept on
file at the Oxford Municipal Building.
      (2)   For a donation to the Parks and Recreation Gift Fund of the value
of an existing tree as determined by the Director of Parks and Recreation and
the cost of staff time and materials, a small plaque of a uniform design
determined by the Director of Parks and Recreation and bearing the species name
and the name of the individual honored may be placed at the base of the tree.
      (3)   For the cost of acquisition and installation, a bench, drinking
fountain or other public amenity certified as needed and consistent with park
design standards by the Director of Parks and Recreation may be donated.  An
appropriate memorial plaque, as determined by the Director of Parks and
Recreation, may be affixed to the donated amenity.
      (4)   Placement of a freestanding memorial to individuals in parks will
be considered only when the individual memorialized is of extraordinary stature
and the memorial is exceptional in design.  An extended approval process
involving appropriate Board and City Council action will be required.
   (b)   When a park is scheduled for renovation, no plaques or amenities may
be placed until park design standards and amenity selections are finalized.
   (c)   The City will not bear responsibility for replacement of lost, stolen
or vandalized plaques.

regulations for the control of plats and subdivisions are adopted by the Oxford
City Council, under authority granted by Chapter 711 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   101  PURPOSE
   These Regulations are adopted as minimum requirements for the regulation and
control of land subdivision within the City of Oxford. These regulations are
intended to:
   (A)    To ensure sound, harmonious subdivision development and City growth
that will become a permanent City asset by establishing minimum standards for
subdivision design and construction.
   (B)   To secure and provide for the proper arrangement of streets or
highways in relation to existing or planned streets or highways, and to the
Official City of Oxford Thoroughfare Plan.
   (C)   To secure and provide for the proper arrangement and efficient use of
land in conjunction with the Official City of Oxford Comprehensive Plan.

and pedestrian circulation, utilities, recreation, light and air.
   (E)    To provide for the avoidance of congestion of traffic.
   (F)    To provide common grounds of understanding and a sound working
relationship between the City and the subdivider and to safeguard the interests
of the homeowner, the applicant, the City and its citizens.
   (G)    To monitor and prevent the scattered and premature platting of lots
beyond the effective operating range of existing public utilities and
improvement.
   (H)    To cause the cost of design and the installation of improvements in
newly platted subdivisions to be borne by the subdivider or applicant rather
than by any direct or indirect burden upon existing property owners beyond the
limits of the subdivision for the improvements servicing their property.
   (I)    To coordinate new subdivision designs with the design of the City as
a whole based on an orderly and efficient sequence of interrelated subdivisions
forming communities.
   (J)    To protect, to the maximum degree possible, historic sites, scenic
points, desirable natural growth, watercourses and other water areas, and other
environmentally sensitive features worthy of preservation.
   (K)    To provide for the accurate surveying of land, preparing and
recording plats and the equitable handling of all subdivision plats by
providing uniform approval procedures for observance by both the approving
authority and applicants.
   (L)    To provide a strong sense of community identity based on a shared,
coherent, functionally efficient physical environment.
   (M)    To inform interested persons of the procedures and standards, for
design and construction of subdivision improvements in the City of Oxford.
   (N)    To provide technically feasible and economically reasonable standards
to achieve a level of subdivision design and construction to minimize damage to
property, degradation of natural resources, and to promote and maintain the
health, safety and general well-being of all life and inhabitants of Oxford.
   (O)   To assure sites suitable for building purposes and human habitation,
and to provide for the harmonious development of the City.
   (P)   To guarantee proper access of firefighting equipment and public
service equipment.
   102  AUTHORITY
   Ohio Revised Code Chapter 711 provides for the legislative body and Planning
Commission of a municipal corporation to adopt regulations governing plats and
subdivisions of land within such jurisdiction.
   103  ADMINISTRATION
   These regulations shall be administered by the City of Oxford Community
Development Department.
   104  JURISDICTION
   These regulations herein shall apply to all plats and all subdivisions of
land within the corporate limits of the City. The City of Oxford City Council
shall have the power of final approval of all plats and all subdivisions within
such territory, pursuant to Section 711.09 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   105  RELATIONS TO OTHER LAWS
   (A)   The provisions of these regulations shall supplement any and all laws
of the City of Oxford and the State of Ohio, or any and all rules and
regulations promulgated by authority of such law or resolution relating to the
purpose and scope of these regulations. Whenever the requirements of these
regulations are at variance with the requirements of any other lawfully adopted
rules, regulations, ordinances, or resolutions, the most restrictive or that
imposing the highest standard shall govern. These regulations shall be
interpreted as minimum requirements.
   (B)   The arrangement, character, width and location of all thoroughfares or
extensions thereof shall conform to the requirements of these regulations and
the Official Thoroughfare Plan of the City of Oxford. Thoroughfares not
contained in the aforementioned plan shall conform to the recommendations of
the Planning Commission based upon the Design Standards set forth in these
regulations. In addition, no plat of land will be approved unless it conforms
to the Zoning Ordinance.
   106  VARIATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS
   (A)   Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape
or is surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict
application of the requirements contained in these regulations would result in
real difficulties or substantial hardship or injustice, Council, after a report
by the Planning Commission, may vary or modify such requirements so that the
subdivider may develop his property in a reasonable manner, but so that, at the
same time, the public welfare and interests of the City and surrounding areas
are protected and the general intent and spirit of these regulations preserved.
   (B)   If a subdivider requests release of his performance bond, as outlined
in Section
203 prior to the installation of sidewalks along the front of the lots in the
subdivision, which have not yet been built upon, he may do so with the consent
of Council by providing the City with a bond to ensure completion of the
sidewalks at a later date.
      (1)   This bond may be cash, or any other bond acceptable to the Law
Director in the amount of one and one-half (1½) times the current cost of such
sidewalks, to provide assurance that these items will be completed.
   107  ENFORCEMENT
   (A)     No plat of any subdivision shall be entitled to record in the Office
of the County Recorder of Butler County or have any validity until it has been
approved in the manner prescribed herein.
   (B)   Council shall not permit any public improvement over which it has any
control to be made, or any money expended for improvements in any area that has
been subdivided, or upon any street that has been platted after the date of the
adoption of this chapter, unless such subdivision or street has been approved
in accordance with the provisions contained herein.
   (C)   Building permits may not be issued until all major utilities are
installed and the street is constructed to the Engineering Division's
satisfaction. Minimum improvements must be completed to a point where vehicles
have reasonable access to the lot for which a permit is being requested.
   108  CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS
   Any regulations or provisions of this chapter may be changed and amended
from time to time by Council, provided, that such changes or amendments shall
not become effective until after study and report by the Planning Commission
and after a public hearing has been held, public notice of which has been given
in a newspaper of general circulation at least thirty (30) days prior to such
hearing.
   109  VALIDITY AND SEPARABILITY
   If any section, paragraph, subdivision, clause, phrase or provision of these
Subdivision Regulations is adjudged invalid or held unconstitutional, the same
shall not affect the validity of these Subdivision Regulations as a whole or
any part or provision thereof other than the part so decided to be invalid or
unconstitutional.
   110  GENERAL
   (A)   No person being the owner, agent or person having control of any land
within the City shall subdivide such land in lots unless by a plat, in
accordance with the regulations  contained herein.
   (B)    Each subdivider of land should confer with the City Manager or
designated City official, before preparing a subdivision plat in order to
become thoroughly familiar with the subdivision requirements, with the
regulations of the Zoning Ordinance and with the proposals of the City
Comprehensive Plan and Thoroughfare Plan affecting the territory in which the
proposed subdivision lies.
   (C)    Wherever any subdivision of land hereafter is laid out, the applicant
or his agent shall apply for and receive approval on a Preliminary and Final
Plat as required by these regulations before any Record Plat may be given final
approval. Said plats and plans of proposed improvements, and all procedure
relating thereto, shall in all respects be in full compliance with these
regulations.
   (D)   No owner, subdivider, or agent of the owner, of any land located
within a subdivision or proposed subdivision, shall enter into any contract for
the sale of, or shall offer to sell said subdivision or any part thereof,
transfer or sell any land by reference to, exhibition of, or by the use of a
plat of the subdivision, nor shall any construction work on the proposed
subdivision proceed until such plat has been approved and recorded in the
manner prescribed in these regulations. The description of such lot or parcel
by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other documents used in
the process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the transaction from
the provisions of these regulations. Any work performed prior to Record Plat
approval will be at the risk of the subdivider.
   (E)   Subdividers are cautioned that the Planning Commission, City Council 
and its staff, in reviewing the Subdivision Plans, shall not be bound by the
modifications to the property in question or the location or construction of
infrastructure, stormwater utility provisions, or any other modification in the
review of the subdivision plans, until formal subdivision plans are formally
approved. Such approval may require removal, relocation, or alteration of such
facilities or structures and restoration of the premises at the subdivider's
expense and may result in delay of plat approval.
   (F)    All land offered to the City for use of streets, alleys, easements,
parks and other public uses shall be accepted by City Council.
   (G)   Zoning approval of a planned unit development does not constitute
subdivision approval. The procedures for approval of planned unit developments
are subject to the approval procedure specified by Chapter
1145 of Planning and Zoning Code.
   (H)   These subdivision regulations apply to residential, commercial and
industrial land proposed to be subdivided. All parcels shall follow the
underlying zoning requirements in regards to site development requirements. The
Planning Commission and City Council may approve variations to the design
standards requirements of these regulations for commercial and industrial land
in accordance with Section
106 above.
(Ord. 3149.  Passed 5-17-11.)
1101.2  SUBDIVISION PROCESS
   Plats containing less than three lots shall follow Section
1101.6, Minor Resubdivisions, Lot Splits and Lot Consolidations and the
provisions therein.

   200   PRE-APPLICATION MEETING AND CONCEPT PLAN
   (A)   The subdivider should meet with the City staff to review a Concept
Plan, prior to the submission of the Preliminary Plat. Although not mandatory,
a Concept Plan review is highly recommended. The purpose of this meeting is to
discuss, early and informally, the purpose and effect of these regulations and
the criteria and standards contained herein. Such meeting is designed to
familiarize the subdivider with the Comprehensive Plan, the Thoroughfare Plan,
and other relevant plans, applicable zoning standards, present proposed
drainage, sewage, and water systems for the City, to ascertain the location of
proposed highways, street connectivity,  public ways, parks, playgrounds, and
other development and to determine the need for a traffic impact study, based
upon the level of impact of this development upon surrounding traffic flow and
safety.
   (B)   The information in
Attachment A  shall be included on a Concept Plan submitted by the subdivider
to be discussed at the pre-application meeting.
   (C)   Upon submittal of a Concept Plan to the City (Community Development
Department), a meeting will be scheduled with the reviewing departments within
fifteen (15) working days. At the meeting, the reviewing departments shall be
required to provide the subdivider a written response with any comments and
concerns including any exceptions, conditions, designs, or requirements
necessary to ensure compliance. Staff has the discretion to recommend if a
Concept Plan should also be presented to the Planning Commission prior to a
Preliminary Plat submittal. No comments or statements made during a pre-
application meeting, or presentation of a Concept Plan to the Planning
Commission, or any of its members, shall be construed as a final acceptance of
a Preliminary Plat until the formal hearing approval of the Planning Commission
and City Council is granted.
   (D)   If the subdivider chooses not to request a pre-application meeting or
submit a Concept Plan, the preparation of a Preliminary Plat for submission to
the Planning Commission for formal consideration can occur.
   201  PRELIMINARY PLAT
   (A)   A Preliminary Plat shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for a
recommendation and then to Council for approval or disapproval. If Council
approves the Preliminary Plat, the subdivider may proceed with the preparation
of the Construction Drawings and the Final Plat. No lots shall be sold from
such plat until approved as herein provided and properly recorded.
   (B)   The design and layout of all subdivisions shall conform to the
requirements of Section 4. The subdivider shall submit a Preliminary Plat for
the entire subdivision, in accordance with the submission requirements of
Attachment B. Any missing information will constitute an incomplete
application.
   (C)   All applications for a Preliminary Plat shall be submitted by a date
determined by the Planning Commission prior to the meeting date in which the
applicant expects to attend. Any late applications shall not be accepted.
   (D)   An approved Preliminary Plat is valid for 3 years from the City
Council Ordinance date, unless otherwise stipulated.  All sections of an
approved preliminary plat shall be filed for final plat approval within three
(3) years of the date of the approval of the preliminary plat. When this 3 year
time period expires, the preliminary plat will be considered void, unless an
extension of the approval has been granted in accordance with Section 205.
   202  CONSTRUCTION DRAWINGS/ IMPROVEMENT PLANS
   (A)   Once the Preliminary Plat has been approved by City Council, the
subdivider shall provide Construction Drawings with all the information
outlined in
Attachment C  with the application, illustrating grading work, construction of
the required street, including water, sanitary and drainage improvements to the
City (Community Development Department). The plans will be distributed to the
reviewing departments. Reviewing departments shall provide written approval,
refusal or requests for modifications to the applicant within thirty (30) days
of the date the plans were received.
   (B)   Construction Drawings for improvements shall be in accordance with any
stipulations set forth in the Preliminary Plat approval, the specifications of
these regulations, the Typical Section Drawings in
Attachment H  herein, the Water and Sanitary Sewer Improvement Specifications
Manual, Storm Water Management Design Manual, Stormwater Drainage Plan, Curb,
Gutter & Sidewalk Specifications Manual, Sanitary Sewer Pump Station
Requirements, and the Water System Master Plan. No work shall commence on the
site until the improvement plans submitted have been approved by all reviewing
departments, approval of the Final Plat and until proof of the recording of the
Record Plat. Any work that has been started prior to recording the Record Plat
or prior to approval from the EPA shall be done so at the risk of the
subdivider.
   (C)   An approved set of Construction Drawings are valid for 2 years from
the date that all signatures are received. All signatures of the reviewing
departments must be obtained before release of the approved Construction
Drawings. When this 2 year time period expires, the Construction Drawings will
be considered void, unless an extension of the approval has been granted in
accordance with Section
205.
   203  FINAL PLAT & RECORD PLAT
   (A)   A Final Plat may be submitted for the entire subdivision or section(s)
thereof. A Final Plat shall be submitted to Council for approval or disapproval
by Ordinance. The Final Plat must substantially correspond to the approved
Preliminary Plat.
   (B)    The corresponding Record Plat may be submitted simultaneously with
the Final Plat with all the information shown on the Record Plat as outlined in
Attachment E  and all necessary clauses outlined in
Attachment H .
   (C)   The design and layout of all subdivisions shall conform to the
requirements of Section
1101.4 . The subdivider shall submit a Final Plat for each section of the
subdivision, in accordance with the submission requirements of
Attachment D . Any missing information will constitute an incomplete
application.
   (D)   All applications for a Final Plat shall be submitted to the Community
Development Department by a date determined by the City Council prior to the
meeting date in which the applicant expects to attend the first reading before
City Council. Any late applications shall not be accepted. A Final Plat
application shall be accompanied with proof of approved, unexpired Construction
Drawings.
   (E)   An approved Final Plat is valid for 1 year from the City Council
Ordinance date, unless otherwise stipulated. All recordings shall be completed
and construction of the infrastructure improvements started within this 1 year
time period or the Final Plat will be considered void, unless an extension of
the approval has been granted in accordance with Section
205 .
   (F)   Following approval of the Final Plat of each section by City Council;
prior to recording the Record Plat and the start of construction, the
subdivider shall file with the Clerk of Council a surety bond, irrevocable
letter of credit, cashier's check or a certified check upon a solvent local
bank conditioned to secure and guarantee the construction of the improvements
in accordance with the requirements of Section
1101.4  and in a satisfactory manner within a period not exceed two years. No
such bond or check shall be accepted unless it is enforceable by or payable to
the City in a sum at least equal to the cost of constructing the improvements
as estimated by the City Engineer and in form with surety and conditions
approved by the City Attorney. Property Bonds for the purpose of guaranteeing
the construction improvements are strictly prohibited.
   (G)   Once the surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit, cashier's check or
certified check is received, the circulation process necessary to obtain the
required signatures of approval and endorsement of the Record Plat will begin
and shall be complete within ten (10) days. The Record Plat will not be
released to the subdivider for recording at the Butler County Recorder's office
until the aforementioned bond is accepted by the City.
   (H)   After final recording at the Butler County Recorder's Office, the
applicant shall furnish a proof of such recording for filing to the Community
Development Department prior to the issuance of any construction permits for
site preparation.
   (I)   All streets shall be constructed, satisfactory to the City Engineer.
No building permits may be issued until all major utilities are installed and
the street is constructed to the City Engineer's satisfaction.
   204  AS-BUILT DRAWINGS
   (A)   At the completion of construction, the Subdivider and/or Owner of the
property subdivided shall be required to submit "As-Built" Construction
Drawings. "As-Built" Construction Drawings shall be revised as necessary to
show the exact locations of critical infrastructure components in accordance
with the rules and regulations of any applicable reviewing department. "As-
Built" Construction Drawings shall be verified by field survey, and shall be
prepared by a professional surveyor and/or engineer, licensed in the State of
Ohio and as permitted by law. "As-Built" Construction Drawings shall be
submitted and approved by all reviewing departments, requiring them, prior to
the release of the performance bond and the acceptance of any public
infrastructure improvements on the subject property. All changes from the
approved Construction Drawings shall be clearly identifiable and in accordance
with the submission requirements of
Attachment F .
   (B)   After all construction work required by the Construction Drawings has
been completed and approved by the City Engineer and/or the representative of
the utility company involved, the subdivider must post a maintenance bond to
maintain and keep in repair, all streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, drainage
facilities and structures for a period of one year. Ten (10%) percent of the
performance bond shall be retained for a period of one year as surety for such
maintenance.
   (C)   Building permits to individual lots will not be released until as-
builts are submitted, accepted and the proper bond has been posted.
   205  EXTENSION OF TIME
   A subdivider may request in writing that City Council grant an extension of
six (6) months, for the approval to the Preliminary Plat, Construction Drawings
or Final Plat, provided they can show reasonable cause for inability to
complete said improvements within the required timeframe. A maximum of two (2)
extensions may be granted.
   The subdivider is solely responsible for knowing the expiration dates and
meeting or extending them in accordance with these Regulations. The City shall
have no duty, obligation or responsibility to remind or notify subdividers of
approaching expiration dates.
   206  FAILURE TO COMPLETE IMPROVEMENTS
   In case the subdivider fails to complete the required public improvements
work within such time period as required by the conditions or guarantees as
outlined above, City Council may proceed to have such work completed and
reimburse itself for the cost thereof by appropriating the cash deposit,
certified check, surety bond, or by drawing upon the letter of credit, or shall
take the necessary steps to require performance by the bonding company.
(Ord. 3149.  Passed 5-17-11.)
1101.3  SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS.

(Ord. 3149.  Passed 5-17-11.)
1101.4  DESIGN STANDARDS AND CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   400  GENERAL STATEMENT
   (A)   In laying out a subdivision, the subdivider shall comply with the
following design standards and requirements. The regulations contained herein,
the Zoning Ordinance, Comprehensive Plan, Stormwater Drainage Plan, Water
System Master Plan, and the City of Oxford Thoroughfare Plan shall control the
manner in which streets, lots, and other elements of a subdivision are arranged
on the land. These design controls shall help ensure:
      (1)   Convenient and safe streets;
      (2)   Creation of useable lots;
      (3)   Provision of space for public utilities;
      (4)   Reservation of land for recreation uses;
      (5)   To minimize the impact on natural resources and the environment,
and
      (6)   To ensure that planning of attractive, connected and functional
neighborhoods shall be promoted, minimizing the undesirable features of
unplanned, unconnected, undirected, haphazard growth.
   
   (B)   The Planning Commission has the responsibility for reviewing the
layout of each future subdivision early in its design development. The
development shall be laid out
      (1)   To minimize
         (a)   The effect on ground water and aquifer recharge;
         (b)   Excavation and embankment;
         (c)   Unnecessary impervious cover;
      (2)   To provide adequate access to lots and sites; and
      (3)   To mitigate adverse effects of noise, odor, traffic, drainage,
utilities and increased storm water runoff on neighboring properties.
   401  SUITABILITY OF LAND
   If the Planning Commission finds that land proposed to be subdivided is
unsuitable for subdivision development due to poor drainage, flood hazard,
topography, inadequate water or sewer supply, slippage potential, unstable
subsurface conditions due to poor soils or other reasons and other such
conditions which may endanger health, life, safety, or property and, if by any
public agencies concerned it is determined that in the best interest of the
public the land should not be developed for the purpose proposed, the Planning
Commission shall not approve the subdivision unless adequate methods for
solving the problems are advanced by the subdivider. For major subdivisions a
written statement may be required by the Planning Commission describing
characteristics of the development site, such as bedrock geology and soils,
topography, flood prone areas, existing vegetation, structures and road
networks, visual features, and past and present use of the site.
   402  SENSITIVE DEVELOPMENT AREAS
   (A)   A Sensitive Development Area is defined as any land(s) or soil(s)
proposed to be subdivided that, if subjected to improper use or management, is
otherwise determined to be incapable or unsuitable of urban use. Sensitive
Development Areas can also be considered those lands that pose special hazards
to development or the environment, consisting of lands or soils of such
sensitive character that they may require special use, design and engineering
restrictions.
   (B)   For the Preliminary Subdivision Plat, the applicant must create an
inventory of sensitive areas identified in Section
402 (d) 1-8 from publicly available resources such as OEPA, ODNR, HAPC, FEMA,
USFWS, OHPO, OKI, Butler County Soil and Water Conservation District, and other
public entities. This information shall be provided with the preliminary
application. Design of the subdivision shall be based on a site analysis
provided by the applicant.
   (C)    After the approval of the Preliminary Subdivision Plat, the applicant
must develop a detailed site analysis of sensitive environmental areas on the
site, conducted by firm(s) specialized in the areas, at a minimum: Ecological
Survey, and Environmental Site Assessment. Other documentation may be required
based on the site and the discretion of the Planning Commission, including, but
not limited to: Stream and Wetland Mitigation, Water Way Permits,
Archaeological Inventory, Historic Architecture Inventory. The applicant must
also provide report of the analyses following current professional norms for
the discipline. It will be the Planning Commission's role to review information
submitted by the applicant on each discipline to make the recommendations to
City Council
   (D)   Design of the subdivision shall be based on the site analysis provided
by the applicant. To the maximum extent practicable, development shall be
located to preserve the natural features of the site, to avoid areas of
environmental sensitivity, and to minimize negative impacts and alterations of
natural features. The following specific areas shall be preserved as
undeveloped open space, and in accordance with the U.S. and Ohio Constitutions
and state or federal regulations:
      (1)   Unique and/or fragile areas, including wetlands, as may be defined
in Section 404, Federal Clean Water Act, as amended; and in Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency standards.
      (2)   Land in the floodway as identified and mapped using the Federal
Emergency Management Agency's Flood Hazard Boundary Maps. Federal Emergency
Management Agency in scientific and engineering reports entitled 'Flood
Insurance Study for Butler County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas' effective 12/
17/2010, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps for Butler County, Ohio
and Incorporated Areas effective 12/17/2010 and any revisions thereto are
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this chapter. 
      (3)   Steep slopes fifteen (15%) percent or more, unless appropriate
engineering measures concerning slope stability, erosion, and resident safety
are taken into account.
      (4)   Habitats of endangered wildlife, as identified on federal and state
lists.
      (5)   Historically and culturally significant structures and sites, as
listed on, but not limited to, the National Register of Historical Places or on
the local inventory of historic places maintained by the City of Oxford's
Historic Architectural Preservation Commission.
      (6)   Aquifers and tributary drainage systems.
      (7)   Tree growth areas or urban forested areas containing native mature
trees.
      (8)   Any area as identified on Map 3.3 of the Comprehensive Plan.
    (E)    The development shall be laid out to avoid adversely affecting
groundwater and aquifer recharge; to reduce excavation and embankment; to avoid
unnecessary impervious cover; to prevent flooding; to provide adequate access
to lots and sites; and, to mitigate adverse effects of noise, odor, traffic,
drainage, and utilities on neighboring properties. The placement of buildings
shall take into consideration topography, building height, orientation and
drainage. Storm Water Best Management Practices and Low Impact Development
Designs are desirable and encouraged. City guidelines for these practices and
designs can be found in the City of Oxford Storm Water Management Design
Manual.
    (F)   If the Planning Commission, or its designated representative, may
require the applicant to submit a statement in order to demonstrate that
satisfactory efforts have been made to mitigate any special hazards posed to
the site if these sensitive lands are subjected to improper use or management.
The statement, if required, shall be submitted in one or more of the following
forms:
      (1)   The statement shall describe in detail the extent of encroachment
on any Sensitive Development Area, the extent and nature of the proposed
alteration, the environmental impacts resulting from the proposed alteration,
and the proposed methods of mitigation.
      (2)    A Geotechnical Report and/or a Wetlands Assessment/Delineation,
prepared by a professional engineer, licensed in the State of Ohio, or by a
specialist in Streams and Wetland. This report can be in lieu of a development
narrative.

   403  TYPICAL SECTIONS
   Subdivisions shall be designed and constructed to conform to the Typical
Sections incorporated by reference herein as Attachment H. The Typical Sections
adopted as the standards for construction and design in the City are the
following:
   (A)   Principal Arterial street typical section;
   (B)   Minor Arterial street typical section;
   (C)   Major Collector street typical section;
   (D)   Minor Collector street typical section;
   (E)   Local street typical section;
   (F)   Alley typical section;

   W.1:   Standard Record Plat Title Sheet;
   W.2:   Standard Record Plat.
   404  STREETS
   The purpose of a street network is to connect spatially separated places and
to enable movement from one place to another. More specifically, the street
network provides continuous and direct routes; provides greater emergency
vehicle access; provides convenience and safety to drivers and pedestrians and
to provide access to residents for goods and services.
   Although the Planning Commission has established general street guidelines,
many of the specific technical standards governing the Public Streets are
regulated by the City of Oxford's Engineering Division.
   (A)   Relation to Adjoining Street System
      (1)   The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make
provisions for the continuation of the principal existing streets in adjoining
areas, or their proper projection where adjoining land is not subdivided,
unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions, or unless, in the
opinion of the Commission, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the
coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the possible future
development of adjacent tracts. The Planning Commission reserves the right to
disapprove any street plan which does not represent good design or does not
ensure continuity of the existing street system.
      (2)   Offset streets shall be avoided within a proposed subdivision and
adjacent to an existing subdivision.
      (3)   The street and alley arrangement(s) shall be such, so as not to
cause a hardship to owners of adjoining property when they plat their own land
and seek to provide for convenient access to it.
      (4)   Streets obviously in alignment with existing streets shall bear the
names of the existing streets. All proposed street names shall be checked
against duplication or near duplication of other street names.
      (5)   Wherever the tract to be subdivided abuts a dedicated or platted
half-width street or alley, the other half-width of such street or alley
falling within the proposed subdivision shall be platted.
      (6)   Any subdivision with its main entrance onto an Arterial or
Collector street shall provide a 25% wider opening at the entrance to the
subdivision than the rest of the subdivision street width, unless otherwise
determined by the Planning Commission.
   (B)   Street Classifications
      (1)   The classification of all proposed streets shall be determined by
the Planning Commission and shall conform to the Official City Thoroughfare
Plan. The proposed use of the street, type of traffic and future traffic volume
shall also be considered in determining the classification of a street.
   
   Street Classifications:
      (a)   Principal Arterial
      (b)   Minor Arterial
      (c)   Major Collector
      (d)    Minor Collector
      (e)   Local streets
      (f)   Alleys
   (C)   Street Improvements
      (1)   All public streets in residential subdivisions shall be the minimum
width necessary to safely and adequately accommodate the vehicular traffic
needs specific to the proposed subdivision, while balancing the needs of safe
alternative modes of transportation. In all instances, street widths shall be
measured from back-to-back of the installed curb. Minimum street width
requirements are contained in Attachment H.
      (2)   The City Engineer shall determine the need for a traffic impact
study, based upon the level of impact of this development upon surrounding
traffic flow and safety.
      (3)   All street and public ways shall be constructed to their full
specified width and to the appropriate grade and shall be surfaced in
accordance with applicable standard specifications of the City. Such
construction shall be subject to inspection by the City Engineer prior to
release of the performance bond by Council. It is the duty of the subdivider to
give proper notification to the City Engineer:
         (a)   Before the commencement of the work;
         (b)   Twenty-four hours prior to seeking an inspection; and
         (c)   At the end of the one-year maintenance improvements. 
      (4)   Proposed streets shall intersect one another and existing street(s)
at right angles as topography and other limiting factors allow.
      (5)   Street grade shall be designed to the Ohio Department of
Transportation Highway Design Manual and acceptable to the City Engineer.
      (6)   Where a tract of land is of such size, location or contour,
preventing a lot arrangement directly related to a normal street design, there
may be established one or more, dead-end/stub streets or other arrangements,
provided that proper access shall be given to all lots from a dedicated street.
      (7)   A cul-de-sac, dead-end/stub street or loop street shall not exceed
500 feet in length unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission due to
topography or unusual circumstances. (See also Section
405(B)(4)
      (8)   All subdivisions shall have at least two (2) entrances to an
existing street system unless otherwise determined by the Planning Commission.
The spacing of the entrances shall be separated and in accordance with traffic
engineering standards.
   (D)   Street Connectivity
   The purpose of this section is to support the creation of a highly connected
transportation system within the City in order to enhance traffic circulation
efficiency for drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists; promote various modes of
transportation; connect neighborhoods to each other and to local destinations
such as schools and parks; reduce emergency response times; reduce vehicle
miles of travel and travel time; increase effectiveness of municipal services
delivery.
      (1)   The following standard shall be met in all new residential
development     in order to increase connectivity.
         (a)   Any residential development shall be required to achieve a
connectivity index of 1.2 or greater unless the Planning Commission determines
that this requirement is impractical due to topography, existing development,
and/or natural features. A connectivity index is a ratio of the number of
street links (road sections between intersections and cul-de-sacs) divided by
the number of street nodes (intersections and cul-de-sac heads).
The following illustration provides an example of how to calculate the index.
Street links on existing adjacent streets that are not part of the proposed
subdivision are not included in the connectivity index calculation.
The measure of connectivity is the number of street links divided by the number
of nodes. Nodes exist at street intersections as well as cul-de-sac heads.
Links are the stretches of road that connect nodes. Stub outs shall also be
considered as links. In this example, there are five (5) links (circles) and
four (4) nodes (stars); therefore, the connectivity index is 1.25.

public streets.   
      (3)   Any proposed private street shall serve a minimum of six (6) lots
in order to be platted and recorded as a private street.
      (4)   All lots utilizing a private street for access shall be provided
with an access easement and maintenance agreement, to be noted on the Record
Plat and to be outlined with the appropriate covenants and restrictions as to
ensure that the private street is appropriately maintained. Such maintenance
agreement shall be acceptable to the Planning Commission and Law Director.
      (5)   The Planning Commission may require passing lanes, turnarounds, and
overhead and width clearances as necessary to accommodate, public utility and
fire and emergency vehicles.
   (F)   Rights-of-Way
   Defined as a general term identifying land or property, usually in the
configuration of a strip, acquired for or devoted to transportation purposes.
When used in this context, right-of-way shall include the roadway, shoulders or
berm, ditch, and slopes extending to the right-of-way limits under the control
of the state or local authority. The usage of the term "right-of-way" for land
platting purposes shall mean that every right-of-way hereafter established and
shown on a final Record Plat is to be separate and distinct from the lots or
parcels adjoining such rights-of-way and not included within the dimensions or
areas of such lots or parcels, provided the size of the lot for zoning purposes
shall be determined by the applicable zoning resolution.

      (3)   The right-of-way shall be measured from lot line to lot line and
shall be sufficiently wide to contain the roadway, curbs, sidewalks, utilities,
graded areas and shade trees.
      (4)   The right-of-way of a new street that is a continuation of an
existing street shall in no case be continued at a width less than that of the
existing street unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer and Planning
Commission.

            (i)   When adjoining undeveloped, vacant or agricultural land, such
buffer width may be reduced to ten (10') feet.
   In high-density developments, when building design and siting do not provide
privacy, the Planning Commission may require landscaping, fences, or walls to
screen dwelling units for privacy. Buffers shall be measured from the property
line.
   411 MAINTENANCE OF THE IMPROVEMENTS
   Whenever any subdivision contains park areas, sewage treatment plants, water
systems, drainage facilities or any other improvements to be used in common by
persons living in the subdivision and which improvements cannot be maintained
or are not maintained by an existing public agency, the deed restrictions
applicable to the subdivision shall contain provisions establishing
trusteeships and assessment procedures that will enable adequate care and
maintenance to be provided for such improvements at the cost of persons
residing in the subdivision.
   412  DEED RESTRICTIONS AND COVENANTS
   Deed restrictions or covenants running with the land may be included to
provide for the creation of a Home Owner's Association, Condominium
Association, or Board of Trustees in which individual owners share common
responsibilities for the cost and upkeep of common open space, private
driveways or streets, park areas, sewage treatment plants, water systems,
drainage facilities or other facilities and the enforcement of the covenants
and restrictions relating to the development. Any  restrictions or easements;
declaration of covenants, bylaws of a Home Owner's Association and its
incorporation; Declaration of Condominium Ownership or other covenants, if any,
shall be reviewed and approved by the City of Oxford Law Director and shall be
recorded with the Record Plat. Enforcement of said Restrictions and Covenants
is not the responsibility of the City.  (Ord. 3432.  Passed 9-19-17.)
1101.5  OPEN SPACE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS.

for in the zoning ordinance may be granted at the discretion of the Planning
Commission as part of the Open Space Subdivision approval process. Such
variation may be authorized on the condition that there are features, amenities
or planning mechanisms deemed adequate by the Planning Commission designed into
the project for the purpose of achieving the objectives intended to be
accomplished with respect to each of the regulations from which a departure is
sought. Any deviations from zoning ordinance standards will require the
Applicant to provide substitute safeguards for each regulation for which there
is noncompliance, in whole or in part, in the development plan.

Should an Open Space Residential Development propose a street width or
infrastructure detail that is not specifically included in Attachment H of
these regulations, the City Engineer shall evaluate and review the proposed
street and make a recommendation to the Planning Commission to determine if the
proposed street will be acceptable as proposed.

landscaping plans.
Plat: The drawing on which the subdivider's plan for a subdivision (preliminary
or final) is presented to the Planning Commission for approval.
Plat of Survey: A land survey performed by a professional surveyor which
identifies a minor subdivision or lot split.
Preliminary Plat: means a proposed subdivision of land together with certain
public improvements which are to be installed therein, including both narrative
and site design information, intended to provide the required reviewing
agencies with a firm understanding of the manner in which the site in question
is to be developed, and to determine whether there are any fundamental flaws
inherent in the proposed subdivision's design, as enumerated these regulations.
Public Improvements: means any of the following: roadway pavement, curbs,
gutters, sidewalks, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers and other
appurtenant construction as related to the subdivision improvement plan.
Public Utility Easement: An easement that may be required along the rear and
sides of lots where needed to accommodate access to a public utility or
sanitary structures. All public utility easements should be depicted on Record
Plats and state any and all conditions and restrictions of the easements.
Public Way: (See Right-of-Way). An alley, avenue, boulevard, bridge, channel,
ditch, easement, expressway, freeway, highway, land, parkway, right-of-way,
road, sidewalk, street, subway, tunnel, viaduct, walk, or other ways in which
the general public entity have a right, or which are dedicated, whether
improved or not.
Record Plat:  The drawing on which the plan of a subdivision is presented for
recording.
Replat: A new recording of a previously recorded subdivision in which the
purpose is to modify some portion of the originally recorded plat.
Resubdivision: Means a change in the plat or drawing of a recorded major or
minor subdivision if such change affects any street layout, lot line or public
way.
Right-of-Way: A general term to noting land, property or the interest therein,
usually in the configuration of a strip, acquired for or devoted to
transportation purposes. When used in this context, right-of-way includes the
roadway, shoulders or berm, ditch, and slopes extending to the right-of-way
limits under the control of the state or local authority. The usage of the term
"right-of-way" for land platting purposes shall mean that every right-of-way
hereafter established and shown on a final Record Plat is to be separate and
distinct from the lots or parcels adjoining such rights-of-way and not included
within the dimensions or areas of such lots or parcels, provided the size of
the lot for zoning purposes shall be determined by the applicable zoning
resolution.
Riparian Corridor/ Buffer: Riparian buffers are strips of grass, trees or
shrubs established adjacent to streams, ditches, wetlands or other water bodies
and are typically a minimum width of 35 feet with a maximum width of 180 feet
and are typically included in the flood hazard zone.
Section: means any area of land specifically so designated by a subdivider on a
Final Plat.
Sensitive Development Area:  Any land(s) or soil(s) proposed to be subdivided
that, if subjected to improper use or management is otherwise determined to be
incapable or unsuitable of urban use. Sensitive Development Areas can also be
considered those lands that pose special hazards to development or to the
environment, consisting of lands or soils that are of such sensitive character
that they made require special use, design, and engineering restrictions.
Setback Line: A line established by the subdivision regulations generally
parallel with and measured from the lot line, defining the limits of a yard in
which no building or structure, other than an accessory building, may be
located above ground.
Sidewalk: That portion of the road right-of-way outside the roadway, which is
improved for the use of pedestrian traffic.
Slippage Potential: The potential which land has to move, under the force of
gravity, should it be disturbed during construction activity.
Slope (Steep): Slopes are determined based on contour intervals of two feet or
less. The percent of slope (rise in feet per horizontal distance) shall be
established by measurement of distance perpendicular to the contour of the
slope. The percent of slope shall be calculated for each two-foot contour
interval. For example, any location on the site where there is a one-foot rise
over a 10-foot horizontal run constitutes a 10 percent slope; a 1.5 foot rise
over a 10-foot horizontal run constitutes a 15 percent slope; a twofoot rise
over a 10-foot horizontal run constitutes a 20 percent slope. For the purpose
of this code, steep slopes are slopes with hydric soils, moderately or severely
erodible soils, which can be engineered to be developed, but not without
additional effort or costs and are regulated to ensure development will not
induce soil erosion, require excessive grading, increase slope instability,
increased runoff, flooding and contamination of surface waters. 
Stopping Sight Distance: The distance down a roadway for which a motorist is
able to have unobstructed sight. Stopping sight distance is reduced by vertical
and horizontal road curvature, fixed objects on the side of the road, and
overhanging vegetation.
Stream, Intermittent: As defined by the U.S. Geological Survey, a watercourse
having a source and terminus, banks, and channel through which waters flow
intermittently throughout the year.
Street: means land connecting to the City highway system and actually
constructed and paved according to City specifications for streets or such land
for which bond has been given to, and approved and accepted by the City to
insure such construction and paving within a certain time, that has:
   (1)   Been duly dedicated by subdivision plat, approved and accepted by the
City and recorded in the plat records of Butler County, Ohio for all highway
purposes, or;
   (2)   Been unconditionally and irrevocably deeded to the City for all
highway purposes with an accompanying survey plat which deed and plat have been
accepted by and recorded by the City, or;
   (3)   Been described by metes and bounds survey and plat and is determined
to be equivalent to a plat dedicated or deeded as a street by virtue of at
least twenty-one years usage for street purposes by the general public which
determination may be made by Council by resolution or by a court of competent
jurisdiction. Council has sole discretion as to whether it desires to make any
such determination.
   (4)   Been expressly permitted by Council to remain privately owned while
open to general public use for highway purposes prior to the enactment of this
section as well as such land hereafter remaining privately owned by virtue of
the application of express provisions of law.
Street Classification: See Thoroughfare, Street, or Road.
Street Pattern: An overall design of streets
   (1)   Curvilinear Pattern: A pattern of streets that are curved.
   (2)   Gridiron Pattern: A street and blocked system resulting in the formal,
regular rectangular blocks and the resulting four way intersections.
   (3)   Radial Pattern: A street system in which the streets converge on a
central point or area.
   (4)   Rectilinear Pattern: A system that is characterized by right angle,
roadways, grid pattern blocks, and four way intersections.
Subdividers: See Developer.
Subdivision:  A subdivision of land is produced by the division of land into
three or more lots, sites or parcels.
   (1)   The division of any parcel of land shown as a unit or as continuous
units on the last preceding tax roll, into two (2) or more parcels, sites or
lots, any one of which is less than five (5) acres for the purpose whether
immediate or future, of transfer of ownership; provided, however, that the
division or partition of land into parcels of more than five acres not
involving any new streets or easements of access, and the sale or exchange of
parcels between adjoining lot owners, where such sale or exchange does not
create additional building sites, shall be exempted; or
   (2)   The improvement of one or more parcels of land for residential,
commercial or industrial structures or groups of structures involving the
division or allocation of land for the opening, widening, extension of any
street or streets, except private streets serving industrial structures; the
division or allocation of land as open spaces for common use by owners,
occupants or lease holders or as easements for the extension and maintenance of
public sewer, water, storm drainage or other public facilities.
Surveyor: Any person registered to practice surveying by the State Board of
Registration as specified in Section 4733.02, of the Ohio Revised Code.
Tract: The term is used interchangeably with the term lot, particularly in the
context of subdivisions, where one "tract" is subdivided into several "lots."
Thoroughfare, Street, or Road: The full width between property lines bounding
every dedicated
travelway, with a part thereof to be used for vehicular traffic and designated
as follows:
   (1)    Alley: A minor street used primarily for vehicular service access to
the back or side of properties abutting on another street.
   (2)   Arterial Street: A general term denoting a highway primarily for
through traffic, carrying heavy loads and large volume of traffic, usually on a
continuous route. Arterials include those classes of highways emphasizing a
high level of mobility for the through movement of traffic. Generally, travel
speeds and distances are greater on arterials as compared to the other
classifications. The highest classes of arterials include interstates and
freeways which are limited access to allow the free flow of traffic.
      A.    Principal Arterials:  Generally, State and US Highways, heavily
traveled County and City Roads, carrying both local and cross county traffic
that links urban and rural communities. Intended to move traffic to and from
interstates and major traffic generators with multiple lanes and a right-of-way
width of 132 feet.
      B.   Minor Arterials:  State and US Highways, County, Township and City
Roads intended to serve through traffic and longer trips. Distributes traffic
from principal arterials to lower class roads with right-of-way widths of 90
feet. Additional slope/utility easement as required.
   (3)    Collector Street: A thoroughfare, whether within a residential,
industrial, commercial, or other type of development, which provide for
distribution of traffic between major and local streets and abutting
properties, including the principal entrance and circulation routes within
residential subdivisions. Collectors collect traffic from the local streets and
roads then distribute the traffic to the arterials. Collectors provide both
mobility and land access. Generally, trip lengths, speeds, and volumes on
collectors are moderate.
      A.   Major Collectors: City, County, and Township roads, carrying local
traffic and moderate to short trips. Distributes traffic to and from principal
and minor arterials and local streets. Additional slope/utility easement as
required.
      B.   Minor Collectors: City, County and Township roads intended to serve
properties that abut them that provides links for short distance trips with
turn lanes as required by traffic analysis and additional slope/utility
easement as required.
   (4)    Cul-de-Sac: A local street of relatively short length with one (1)
end open to traffic and the other end terminating in a vehicular turnaround.
   (5)   Dead-end/ Stub Street: A street temporarily having only one (1) outlet
for vehicular traffic and intended to be extended or continued in the future.
   (6)    Local Street: A street primarily for providing access to individual
properties residential, commercial, or other abutting property. Provides access
to the collector and arterial system with Right-of-Way (R/W) widths of 60 feet.
Additional slope/utility easement as required. The primary function of local
streets and roads is to provide land access. Travel speeds, distances, and
volumes are generally low, and through traffic is usually discouraged on local
streets and roads.
   (7)   Loop Street: A type of local street each end of which terminated at an
intersection with the same arterial or collector street, and whose principal
radius points of the one hundred and eighty (180) degree system of turns are
not more than three thousand (3000) feet from said arterial or collector
street, nor normally more than six hundred (600) feet from each other.
   (8)    Marginal Access Street: A local or collector street, parallel and
adjacent to an arterial or collector street, providing access to abutting
properties and protection from arterial or collector streets.
   (9)   Private Street: A roadway which has not been dedicated to the City and
is completely maintained by the adjoining property owners. This roadway is not
maintained by the City and is owned entirely by the property owners who use it.
Thoroughfare Plan: A comprehensive plan that is adopted by the City of Oxford
City Council and establishes the official right-of-way width of major streets
and the general location recommended for arterial, collector and local
thoroughfares.
Through Lot: See Lot Types.
Urban Forest:  Means trees, woody vegetation, wildlife and other natural
resources found in the urban environment.
Variance: A modification of the strict terms of the relevant regulations where
such modification will not be contrary to the public interest and where owing
to conditions peculiar to the property and not the result of the action of the
applicant, a literal enforcement of the regulations would result in unnecessary
and undue hardship.
Vicinity Map: A drawing located on the plat which sets forth by dimensions or
other means, the relationship of the proposed subdivision or use to other
nearby developments or landmarks and community facilities and services within
the City in order to better locate and orient the area in question.
Watershed: The drainage basin in which the subdivision drains or that land
whose drainage is affected by the subdivision.
Wetland: Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water
at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal
circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life
in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs,
and similar areas. One or more indicators of wetland vegetation, hydric soil,
or wetland hydrology must be present for an area to be a wetland (U.S. Army
Corps. Engineers).
Yard: An open space that lies between the principal building or buildings and
the nearest lot line. The minimum required yard as set forth in the ordinance
is unoccupied and unobstructed from the ground upward except as may be
specifically provided in the zoning ordinance.
   (1)   Yard, Front: A space extending the full width of the lot between any
building and the front lot line and measured perpendicular to the building at
the closest point to the front lot line.
   (2)   Yard, Rear: A space extending across the full width of the lot between
the principal building and the rear lot line and measured perpendicular to the
building to the closest point of the rear lot line.
   (3)   Yard, Side: A space extending from the front year to the rear yard
between the principal building and the side lot line and measured perpendicular
from the side lot line to the closest point of the principal building.

   (b)   Procedure. 
      (1)   Upon the filing of an application and payment of a fee the Zoning
Administrator shall process the application as follows:

requirements of this Section can be satisfied.

the Zoning Administrator makes his or her report shall be available for public
inspection at the office of the Administrator.
      (5)   Applications that require public notice prior to a public hearing
shall be publicized in a newspaper, by mail, and by posting the property as

shall be published in at least one newspaper of general circulation in Oxford
at least 30 days prior to the scheduled public hearing for code amendments,
subdivisions and planned unit developments. 
Variances and Conditional Uses
A legal notice shall be published in at least one newspaper of general
circulation in Oxford at least seven 7 days prior to the scheduled public
hearing for variances and conditional uses.  Such notice shall state the time
and place of the hearing, the nature of the application or petition, and a
statement that describes whether this is a final decision or a recommendation
that will be referred to Council for a final decision.
         B.   Mail
Code Amendments, Subdivisions and Planned Unit Developments

shall be notified of applications for code amendments, subdivisions and planned
unit developments. 
Variances and Conditional Uses
Owners of all land abutting the site shall be notified of applications for
variances, and conditional uses.  This is a courtesy notice.  Failure by the

above to receive such notice shall not invalidate any action resulting from the
public hearing.
         C.   Posting 
At least seven (7) days prior to the public hearing, the applicant shall post
signs on the site, provided by the City, along each public right-of-way that
abuts the site and at other locations or intersections near or leading to the

list the type, time, and place of the hearing, and shall be legible from the
public right-of-way.  This is a courtesy notice.  Failure by the Zoning
Administrator to provide such signs as described shall not invalidate any
action resulting from the public hearing.  Removal of such signs, once set,
shall be a violation of this Code in addition to any other laws against their
removal that may apply.
      (6)   The Zoning Administrator shall include the application and any
additional information the Administrator determines appropriate, including a
staff report or recommendation, in the agenda for the meeting at which the

subsequent actions required to implement them.
      (8)   The Zoning Administrator shall ensure that all applications,
whether approved, denied, or withdrawn prior to a public hearing, are archived
in such a manner that permits a person to determine the nature of the
application, the applicant’s rationale in seeking a decision in their favor,
and the eventual disposition of the application.

Commission, by adoption of a motion by Council, or by application to Planning
Commission by at least one owner  of the property within the area proposed to
be rezoned.

text amendment, the Zoning Administrator shall place the item on the Planning
Commission agenda as required by Section 1129.09, Application Administration.

substantially similar to that required of an application for amendment.
   An application for amendment shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator. 
An application shall be complete prior to being scheduled for a public
hearing.  An application will be considered complete only if the Zoning
Administrator is satisfied that all of the materials required by this chapter
are included and are sufficient in their content to satisfy the intent of the
application requirements.

CHAPTER 1137
Nonconformities
1137.01   Purpose.
1137.02   Administration.
1137.03   Avoidance of undue hardship.
1137.04   Nonconforming land uses.
1137.05   Nonconforming lots.
1137.06   Nonconforming structures.
1137.07   Discontinuance of nonconformities.
1137.08   Restoration of nonconforming building damaged by fire, explosion, act
of God or the public enemy.
1137.09   Nonconforming vehicle management.
1137.10   Nonconforming signs.
   1137.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to recognize the existence of uses,
buildings, lots and structures that lawfully existed at the time of this Code's
enactment, or amendment thereto, but which now do not conform with one or more
of the regulations contained in this Code. This Chapter regulates the
disposition of legally established nonconforming uses, buildings, lots and
structures which are subject to regulations limiting their use, restoration,
reconstruction, extension, and substitution. Such nonconforming status shall be
permitted to continue only in conformance with this Chapter. The provisions are
intended to encourage the reduction of nonconformity with this Zoning Code in
the short-term and elimination of nonconformities in the long-term, while
respecting vested interests in the existing uses and improvements.
(Ord. 3206.  Passed 3-19-13.)
   1137.02  ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)       The provisions of this Chapter shall apply only to nonconformities
that have been legally established. A nonconformity that was not legally
established shall not qualify for any of the protections provided.
   (b)       An applicant and/or owner for any development review procedure
that deals with nonconformities shall bear the burden of proof in demonstrating
that the use was a legal nonconformity on the effective date of this Code.
   (c)    Board of Zoning Appeals shall have all powers conferred upon it as
per Section 713.15 of the Ohio Revised Code, or as authorized by the City of
Oxford Charter and in compliance with state law.
   (d)    The Zoning Administrator shall determine if a use, lot, structure, or
site is less nonconforming than another use, lot, structure, or site based upon
criteria such as required parking spaces, trip generation, potential nuisances,
setbacks, bulk, or other criteria relevant to the intent of this Code.
(Ord. 3206.  Passed 3-19-13.)
   1137.03  AVOIDANCE OF UNDUE HARDSHIP.
       (a)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Code shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building
or structure on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Code and upon which actual
building construction has been carried on diligently.
   (b)   Actual construction is defined to include the placing of construction
materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner.
   (c)   Where demolition or removal of an existing building has substantially
begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to
be actual construction, provided that the work shall be carried out
diligently. 
(Ord. 3206.  Passed 3-19-13.)
   1137.04  NONCONFORMING LAND USES.
   Any use of any structure or lot that was conforming or validly nonconforming
and otherwise lawful at the enactment date of this Code and is nonconforming
under the provisions of this Code or that shall be made nonconforming by a
subsequent amendment, may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the standards and limitations of this Section.
   (a)   General Regulations and Development Standards.
      (1)   A nonconforming use may not move in whole or in part to any other
location of the lot unless the use satisfies the provision of this Section.
      (2)   A nonconforming use may be enlarged, expanded or extended to occupy
parts of another structure or portions of a lot that it did not occupy on the
effective date of this Ordinance, provided such enlargement shall comply with
the provisions of this Chapter. Additionally, such expansion, extension and
enlargement shall not increase the degree of nonconformity, or increase in
intensity.
      (3)   Any building or structure containing a nonconforming use may be
enlarged up to 25% of the existing total gross floor area on the effective date
of this Ordinance, provided that the expanded portion complies with all
coverage and site development requirements of the zone in which it is located.
      (4)   A porch addition to the front façade of an existing residential
building that contains a nonconforming use may be permitted, provided that the
proposed addition satisfies the design standards, setback and lot coverage
regulations of the District. Such porch addition shall not be enclosed and
shall be open at least on 2 sides.
      (5)   Any proposed addition under Section
1137.04(a)(3) shall be considered as reconfiguration to an existing structure
and shall comply with the conditions set forth in this Chapter.
      (6)   The enlargement of a nonconforming use that has the effect of
making a structure nonconforming, other than as described in subsection (c)
above, shall not be permitted, but rather shall be construed as a request for a
variance.
      (7)   Any nonconforming vehicle management shall be made in conformance
with the current regulations when the improvement to the structure is
considered a reconfiguration and reconstruction.
      (8)   A legal nonconforming land use may be extended throughout those
parts of an existing building, provided that the extension shall not create any
new nonconformity. Such improvement is considered as reconfiguration and shall
comply with the conditions outlined below.
      (9)   Change to another Nonconforming Use.  Except as provided in this
Section, a nonconforming use may be changed only to a use that conforms to the
Ordinance. Once changed to a conforming use, no use may revert to a
nonconforming use.
   (b)   Improvements to a Structure.  Improvements to a structure containing a
nonconforming use may be permitted, but are subject to the following
conditions:
      (1)   Such improvements result from being remodeled, damaged or
demolished voluntarily.
      (2)   Such improvements shall not cause a new nonconformity, nor shall it
increase the degree of nonconformity or noncompliance existing prior to such
remodeling or improvements, except permitted in this Section. 
      (3)   For nonconforming residential uses in residential districts:
Improvements fall within the following three categories (as defined in Section
1159.19):
      (4)   Renovation: For renovation, the following shall apply:
         A.   Any structure may be maintained to its original footprint, no
reduction in occupancy.
      (5)   Reconfiguration:  For reconfiguration, the following shall apply:
         A.   Any structure that has more occupancy than permitted in the
underlying zoning district shall have its occupancy reduced by at least 30%
from the approved rental occupancy, or the allowable occupancy permitted in the
underlying district, whichever is larger.
         B.   The use and structure remain nonconforming unless they satisfy
the requirements of that District.
         C.   All fractional numbers of residential occupancy greater than or
equal to 0.5 shall be rounded up to the next whole number.
         D.   Proposed enlargement that is above and beyond 25% of the existing
total gross floor area on the effective date of this Code may be allowed,
provided additional reduction in occupancy from the approved rental permit
based on the ratio of each one percent of the additional enlargement, one
percent of reduction in occupancy is required subject to the approval of the
Planning Commission.
      (6)   Reconstruction: For reconstruction, the following conditions shall
apply:
         A.   The new building shall satisfy all the site development
regulations of that District.
         B.   The use shall satisfy the underlying use regulations.
      (7)   For other nonconforming uses: Nonconforming use may be expanded, as
described in Section
1137.04(a)(3).  In no instance, shall the uses increase in intensity.  (Ord.
3206.  Passed 3-19-13.)
   1137.05  NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   (a)   A lot in a residential zoning district that does not satisfy the site
development regulations for any permitted use in that District may have erected
on it a single-family dwelling if the lot has a minimum area of 3,000 square
feet and a minimum lot width of 33 feet. This provision shall apply even though
the lot fails to meet the requirements for lot areas, lot depth, lot width, or
any combination thereof that are generally applicable in the zoning district
provided that the new single-family conforms to the height, lot coverage,
vehicular access and yard or setback requirements of the District where the
property is located.
   (b)   Additions to a conforming/permitted use and structure on a
nonconforming lot are permitted if the addition satisfies all site development
regulations of the District where the property is located.
   (c)   The lot on which there is located a nonconforming use or structure,
shall not be reduced in any of the dimensional requirements to further increase
the structure's nonconformity.
(Ord. 3206.  Passed 3-19-13.)
   1137.06  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
       Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Code that could not be built under the terms of this Code by
reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on
the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure,
such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject
to the following provisions:
   (a)   Additions to a nonconforming structure are permitted if the addition
satisfies all  dimensional requirements of the code and the use occupying the
building is an approved permitted or conditional use.
   (b)   No nonconforming building or structure may be enlarged or altered in a
way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may
be altered to decrease its nonconformity.
   (c)   A nonconforming building or structure shall not be enlarged or
extended unless the proposed extension is in compliance with the regulations of
the District in which it is located, and will not increase any existing
nonconformity in any other portion of the building or structure.
   (d)   A nonconforming building or structure shall not be moved in whole or
in part to any other location on the lot or to another premise(s) unless the
building is made to conform to the regulations of the District in which it is
to be located.
   (e)       A building or structure that contains a dwelling unit, that has
less than the minimum required lot or dwelling square foot area may be changed
in any way that does not make the dwelling unit area more nonconforming and
does not violate any other provision of this code.
   (f)   Reconstruction of damaged and demolished nonconforming structures may
be permitted provided that the reconstructed portion satisfies the site
development regulations of the District.
      (Ord. 3206.  Passed 3-19-13.)
   1137.07  DISCONTINUANCE OF NONCONFORMITIES.
   (a)   A nonconforming land use, structure, or portion thereof, shall not be
reinstated if it is discontinued for a continuous one-year period and
thereafter any use of the premises shall conform to the use regulations of the
District in which the building or lot is located. The intent to continue a
nonconforming use shall not be assumed to be evidence of its continuance.
   (b)   A nonconforming structure or lot that has been made conforming shall
not be made nonconforming. 
(Ord. 3206.  Passed 3-19-13.)
   1137.08  RESTORATION OF NONCONFORMING BUILDING DAMAGED BY FIRE, EXPLOSION,
ACT OF GOD OR THE PUBLIC ENEMY.
   Any building which has been damaged by fire, explosion, act of God or the
public enemy may be repaired and reconstructed and used as before the time of
damage provided that a complete application for such repairs or reconstruction
is filed within one year of the date of such damage and such repair or
reconstruction is substantially completed within one year of the issuance of a
zoning certificate.
(Ord. 3206.  Passed 3-19-13.)
   1137.09  NONCONFORMING VEHICLE MANAGEMENT.
   (a)   A conforming land use that does not have a sufficient number of
parking spaces to satisfy this Code, or an amendment thereto, may continue
indefinitely; however, the  vehicle management and landscaping requirements for
the entire use shall be satisfied if the use is expanded within the existing
structure, if the structure is expanded or if the use is changed or
substituted.
   (b)     A use that is required to meet the nonresidential vehicle management
area regulations and that does not satisfy the design criteria of this Code may
continue indefinitely; however, the design criteria for the entire site shall
be made to comply with all provisions of this Code if the footprint of the
principle structure is expanded upon a change of use.
(Ord. 3206.  Passed 3-19-13.)
   1137.10  NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   (a)       Determination of Legal Nonconformity:
      (1)       An existing sign that does not conform to the specific
provisions of this Code may be eligible for the designation of a "legal
nonconforming sign" provided that the sign was covered by a valid permit or
variance, or complies with all applicable laws on the effective date of this
Code, and amendments thereto.
   (b)     Loss of Legal Nonconforming Status:  A legal nonconforming sign
loses the legal nonconforming designation if:
      (1)       The sign is relocated;   
      (2)       The sign is replaced;
      (3)       The structure or size of the sign is altered in any way except
towards compliance with this Chapter. This provision does not refer to general
maintenance, changeable marquees, or face and copy changes.
      (4)       The sign is part of an establishment that discontinues its
operation for a period of 1 year.
      (5)   The sign has not been used for a continuous period of six (6)
months.
   (c)   Maintenance and Repair of Nonconforming Signs:
      (1)   Normal maintenance shall be permitted, which includes painting of
chipped or faded signs; replacement of faded or damaged surface panels; or
repair or replacement of electrical wiring or electrical devices. A non-
conforming sign shall not be structurally altered to prolong the life of the
sign.
      (2)   If the sign suffers damage to an extent greater than 60% of the
estimated replacement value, the sign shall be replaced with a sign that
complies with Chapter
1151. 
   (d)   No new signs are permitted for nonconforming land uses.
(Ord. 3206.  Passed 3-19-13.)
CHAPTER  1139
Variances
1139.01   General.
1139.02   Procedure.
   1139.01  GENERAL.
   (a)   Purpose. A variance permits variation from the strict interpretation
of this Code so that no specific provision prevents development of a specific
site that would otherwise not be possible and that would satisfy the general
intent of the Code. Use variances are prohibited.
   (b)   Variance Requirement. Each variance shall be granted according to the
provisions of this chapter.
   (c)   Effect of Variance.
      (1)   A variance shall be valid only for the specific use, site,
location, and provision for which it is granted and changes to the use and site
that change the facts upon which it was granted shall be strictly interpreted.
      (2)   A variance does not expire, but becomes invalid if the use, site,
or location is changed in some way that changes the facts upon which it was
granted.
      (3)   An action or construction that is undertaken following the granting
of a variance does not create a nonconformity. A variance actually changes the
specific provisions of the Code as they pertain to a specific use, site, and
location.
         (Ord.  3036.  Passed 12-2-08.)
   1139.02  PROCEDURE.
    (a)   Application.   An application for a variance shall be filed with the
Zoning Administrator. An application shall be complete prior to being scheduled
for an adjudication hearing. An application will be placed on the agenda only
if the Zoning Administrator is satisfied that all of the materials required by
this chapter are included and are sufficient in their content to satisfy the
intent of the application requirements. The Board will not hear any appeal on
an application the Board deems incomplete.
      (1)   Contents of application for variance. Eight complete sets of all
information shall be submitted with an application. The Zoning Administrator
may modify this requirement based upon the type of materials included. The
applicant is encouraged to contact the Zoning Administrator prior to submitting
an application to discuss the submission requirement. If any information is
submitted in color or on non-standard paper, more copies may be required.
         A.    Application Fee.
         B.    Description of Use and Site.
         C.    The name, mailing address, and telephone number of the applicant
and the property owner.
         D.    If the applicant is not the owner, a statement from the owner
that the applicant is entitled to apply on his or her behalf (Letter of
Agency).
         E.    A legal description of the site, including all separate lots.
         F.    A description of the existing uses of the site.
         G.    The zoning district in which the site is located.

services performed, and expected number of customers, clientele, delivery, and
service vehicles.
            2.   The hours of operation.
         I.    The nature and magnitude of the requested variance.
         J.    The Code section from which the variance is requested.
         K.   A separate narrative statement that explains how the proposed
variance satisfies each of the Decision Standards required to grant a variance.
         L.    A list of the names and mailing addresses of all landowners
within  200 feet of the perimeter of the site.
      (2)   Site Plan. A scaled site plan shall include the following
information in detail. The required information may be submitted on multiple
site plans if inclusion of all information on a single plan makes it illegible
or difficult to understand.
         A.    North arrow.
         B.    Scale.
         C.    Vicinity map.    
         D.    All existing and proposed lot lines within the site.
         E.    Dimensions of all lots and of the entire site and any adjacent
rights-of-way.
         F.    Location, height, and use of all proposed and existing
structures.

landscaping.
         J.    Distances to residential zoning districts if within 1,000 feet.
         K.    The use of land and location of structures on adjacent property
and across adjacent rights-of-way.
         L.    An indication of the regulation from which the variance is
requested.
         M.       Other information as required by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (3)    Elevations. Elevations of proposed structures, or typical
elevations if structures are not yet designed, may be required by the Zoning
Administrator if the proposed location, height, or bulk of the structure is
such that it may negatively affect an adjacent use.
      (4)    Other. Photographs of the existing use and its surroundings and
other information regarding the proposed use, site, or surrounding area as may
be pertinent to the application or required by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (b)    Reapplication.
      (1)    No application for a variance that is substantially similar to an
application that has been denied or granted, wholly or in part, or revoked,
shall be submitted for one year to the BZA for a decision. The Zoning
Administrator shall determine if a similar application differs enough to be
considered a different application and not subject to this section. The Zoning
Administrator may consider factors such as the nature or size of a proposal,
changes in the development or traffic patterns of the area, or newly discovered
evidence pertinent to a decision on a previous application.
      (2)    An applicant may appeal the decision of the Zoning Administrator
to the Board of Zoning Appeals as stipulated in this Chapter and Section
1129.09 of the Planning and Zoning Code.
   (c)    Board of Zoning Appeals Review. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall
base its review of a variance application upon the complete application, upon
any staff report, and upon any relevant and credible public testimony and
evidence presented during the adjudication hearing. If the Board of Zoning
Appeals finds that the information provided is insufficient to make a
determination, it may suspend its review until sufficient information has been
provided.
      (1)    Burden of proof. The applicant shall be required to present by
preponderance of reliable, probative and substantial testimony and evidence
that supports the applicants request for a variance.
      (2)    Decision standards. The Board of Zoning Appeals will consider the
effect of the request on the public health, safety and welfare. Variances shall
be granted only upon a determination that practical difficulties exist with
respect to the property in question that would render strict application of the
Planning and Zoning Code unreasonable. This determination shall be made without
regard to the existence of variances and nonconformities on other land, sites,
or structures not presently under consideration. In determining whether
practical difficulties exist sufficient to warrant a variance, the Board shall
consider and weigh the following factors:
         A.    Whether the property in question will yield reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
         B.    Whether the variance is substantial;
         C.    Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
         D.    Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (i.e. water, sewer, garbage);
         E.    Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge
of the zoning restriction;
         F.    Whether the property owners' predicament feasibly can be
obviated through some method other than a variance;
         G.    Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement
would be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance.
         H.    Any other relevant factor.
   (d)    Action by Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (1)    The Board of Zoning Appeals shall grant, grant with conditions, or
deny a variance application as presented and shall clearly state the findings
upon which its decision is based.
      (2)    The Board of Zoning Appeals shall base its decision only upon the
Decision Standards in this Chapter. In its decision, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may waive or modify dimensional regulations of the Zoning Code, or
impose more strict regulations and any additional conditions, guarantees, and
safeguards it deems necessary to satisfy the purposes of this Zoning Code.
   (e)    Issuance of Permits.
      (1)    The Zoning Administrator shall issue permits to permit the action
for which a variance was sought after the Board of Zoning Appeals grants a
variance. Construction permits shall not be issued unless the plans
substantially conform to those upon which a variance was granted. Any action
that exceeds a granted variance shall constitute a violation of the Zoning
Code.
      (2)    No order of the Board permitting erection or alteration of a
building or the use of a building or premises shall be valid for a period
longer than six (6) months, and upon the expiration of such period shall
automatically be deemed revoked, unless a building permit for such erection or
alterations is obtained and the work is started within such period, or, where
no erection or alteration is necessary, the permitted use is established within
such period, or an extension is requested in writing and granted by the Board.
   (f)    Appeal of Board of Zoning Appeals Decision.
      (1)   Appeals to the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be
made to the Court of Common Pleas of Butler County.
         (Ord. 3214.  Passed 4-16-13.)

      Purpose and Applicability.
         A.   The purpose of the Mile Square Design Standards is to establish
design standards for all new, expanded, or renovated buildings so they are part
of the urban form and character of the Mile Square District. These standards
are not intended to dictate any specific architectural style or design but
rather are intended to allow imaginative design that is respectful to
surrounding properties and the overall district.. The Mile Square Design
Standards are intended to provide predictable requirements while also allowing
for flexibility in design.
         B.   The design of all new construction and exterior alteration or
renovation in the R2-MS District shall conform to the following requirements.
      (1)    Front Façade.
         A.   All development shall be located parallel to the associated
public street with the main entry door designed to face onto the associated
public street unless an alternative orientation is consistent with the majority
of homes along the same block face.

   (d)    Mile Square Design Standards.
      Purpose and Applicability.
         A.   The purpose of the Mile Square Design Standards is to establish
design standards for all new, expanded, or renovated buildings so they are part
of the urban form and character of the Mile Square District. These standards
are not intended to dictate any specific architectural style or design but
rather are intended to allow imaginative design that is respectful to
surrounding properties and the overall district.. The Mile Square Design
Standards are intended to provide predictable requirements while also allowing
for flexibility in design.
         B.   The design of all new construction and exterior alteration or
renovation in the R3-MS District shall conform to the following requirements.
      (1)    Front Façade.
         A.   All development shall be located parallel to the associated
public street with the main entry door designed to face onto the associated
public street unless an alternative orientation is consistent with the majority
of homes along the same block face.

   1145.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)   Purpose.  Planned developments incorporate land uses and development
patterns that are intended to permit and encourage creative and flexible land
development that is not permitted by-right under the administrative regulations
of underlying zoning districts.  The planned development is particularly well
suited to address two distinct goals of the Comprehensive Plan:  to provide for
environmentally sensitive and cohesive developments that are an attractive
alternative to traditional subdivision and infill development that fully
utilizes available land and existing utility resources where they already
exist.
      (1)   Planned developments share these common goals:
         A.   Protect the neighbors of a planned development and the City in
general to at least the same degree normally inherent in the Zoning Code.
         B.    Produce a development equal to or better than that resulting
from single-use or traditional subdivision
         C.   Facilitate the construction of a variety of dwelling types to
serve Comprehensive Plan goals of diverse and affordable housing.
         D.   Have a site and situation that permits comprehensive planning
both on the site and relative to its immediate surroundings
         E.   Result in a design in which the placement, height, and uses of
buildings, vehicle management areas, and open spaces efficiently utilize
potentials of the site
         F.   Include covenants, easements, and other private measures that
will help ensure the long-term administrative viability of a development
         G.   Be functional within a time period that helps ensure a viable
development
      (2)   Infill development also satisfies the following goals:
         A.   Fully utilize sites that could not be fully utilized because of
their shape or because of their location relative to available public access.
         B.   Increase geographic efficiencies of existing utilities such as
public streets, water, sewer, electric, telephone, and cable by using them
where they are already available.
         C.   Help keep development from sprawling to and beyond the municipal
boundaries of Oxford.
      (3)   Open Space development also satisfies the following goals:
               A.     Retain natural areas and landscapes.
                 B.     Protect environmentally sensitive land and water
features.
                 C.     Retain or create active and passive open spaces that
serve the recreation needs of the development or the City generally.
                 D.     Lessen the land area devoted to vehicle management.
                 E.     Preserve natural scenic views that contribute to the
Oxford setting.
            (Ord. 3520.  Passed 3-19-19.)
   1145.02  APPROVAL REQUIREMENT.
   Each planned development shall be approved according to the provisions of
this chapter.
(Ord. 3520.  Passed 3-19-19.)
   1145.03  EFFECT OF APPROVAL.
   A planned development shall be valid only for the specific land uses,
location, physical arrangement, and covenants and restrictions approved in a
final plan.

   1145.04  PROCEDURE.
   Applications for a planned development shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator.  An application shall be complete prior to being scheduled for a
public hearing.  An application will be considered complete only if the Zoning
Administrator is satisfied that all of the materials required by this chapter
are included and are sufficient in their content to satisfy the intent of the
application requirements.
   (a)   Pre-application Conference.  Prior to filing a formal application for
approval of planned development, the developer shall request a pre-application
conference with the Zoning Administrator. The purpose of such conference is to
allow the developer to present a general concept of this proposed development
prior to the preparation of detailed plans. For this purpose, the presentation
shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

   1145.06  PLANNING COMMISSION AND COUNCIL REVIEW.
   A preliminary plan shall be approved prior to approval of a final plan,
although the processes can be concurrent for small, single phase developments. 
Both preliminary and final plan approval require a Planning Commission
recommendation and Council approval.
   The Planning Commission shall base its review of a proposed planned
development upon the complete application, upon any staff report, and upon any
relevant and credible public comment presented during the public hearing. 
Council shall base its decision on the same materials and shall also consider
the Planning Commission recommendation.
   The general decision standards for approval of a preliminary and final
planned development are substantially similar.  The final plan requires greater
detail and is subject to additional decision standards.
   If, at any time, the Planning Commission or Council finds that the
information provided is insufficient to make a determination, it may suspend
its review until sufficient information has been provided.
   (a)   Burden of Proof.  Planning Commission has no obligation to recommend
approval and City Council has no obligation to approve a planned development. 
This Zoning Code assumes that a planned development is appropriate only if an
applicant proves that the proposed uses and design will not be detrimental to
the public health, safety, or general welfare of the City or the neighborhood
in which it is proposed.
      Applicants shall prove that potential negative impacts of elements such
as location, size and extent of facilities and operations, site design, traffic
generation, site access, and potential impact upon public facilities will be
adequately mitigated.
   (b)     General Decision Standards.  All planned developments shall satisfy
these general decision standards:
      (1)   The proposed planned development is in fact permitted in the zoning
districts in which it is proposed.
      (2)   If the application is for the same site where a planned development
application has been denied within one year, the plan is substantially
different from the application so denied.
      (3)   The uses and site plan will satisfy the general intent of this
Zoning Code.
      (4)   The uses and site plan will be compatible with the general intent
of the Comprehensive Plan.
      (5)   The size and shape of the site are sufficient for the proposed
planned development.
      (6)   The use will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or
potential future neighboring uses that are permitted in the zoning district.
      (7)   The use will not involve activities, processes, materials,
equipment, or conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any person,
property, or the general welfare because of excessive production of traffic,
noise, smoke, fumes, glare, odors, or other emissions.
      (8)   Accessory uses will be directly related to the operation of the
principal uses and will not be operated independent of the principal uses.
      (9)   The use and site will be adequately served by public facilities and
services such as streets, water and sewer, drainage structures, police and fire
protection, and refuse disposal, or adequate provisions will be made to provide
the same services privately.
      (10)   Development of the site and operation of the use will not require
substantial public expenditure for additional infrastructure or services.
      (11)   The site will be designed, constructed, and maintained in a
character harmonious in appearance and general character with the existing or
intended character of the general vicinity, and that such use will not change
the essential character of the same area.  Structures to be constructed,
reconstructed, or altered in a residential zoning district shall have the
appearance of residential buildings permitted in the zoning district.
      (12)   The site is designed so that on-site traffic and traffic accessing
the site will not adversely impact the movement or safety of all modes of
traffic on adjacent public streets.
      (13)   Proposed construction will not result in the destruction, loss, or
damage of a natural, scenic, or historic feature of major importance.
   (c)   Additional Final Plan Decision Standards.
      (1)   The final planned development shall substantially conform to the
preliminary plan.
      (2)   Any substantial changes from the preliminary plan improve the plan
or were requested by Planning Commission or Council as a part of the
preliminary plan approval process.
      (3)   If the final plan seeks approval of only a portion of the approved
preliminary plan, the elements of the proposed phase are sufficient to stand
alone if the remainder of the planned development is abandoned.
         (Ord. 3520.  Passed 3-19-19.)
   1145.07  ACTION BY PLANNING COMMISSION AND COUNCIL.
   (a)  The Planning Commission shall recommend to Council approval, approval
with conditions, or denial of an application as presented and shall clearly
state the findings upon which its recommendation is based.
   (b)   The Planning Commission shall base its recommendation and Council its
decision upon how well the application satisfies the Decision Standards. 
Planning Commission, in its recommendation, and Council in its decision may
waive or modify dimensional regulations of the Zoning Code, or impose more
strict regulations and any additional conditions, guarantees, and safeguards it
deems necessary to satisfy the purposes of this Zoning Code. Dwelling unit
density cannot be waived.
   (c)   Council may require the developer to file performance bonds with the
City to guarantee completion of any public utilities associated with the
planned development and any elements of the plan that are necessary to its
success, if abandoned by the developer.
(Ord. 3520.  Passed 3-19-19.)
 
   1145.08  RECORDING, PERMITS, AND OCCUPANCY.
   (a)     Recording.
      (1)   An approved final plan must be filed with Butler County in legal

the like are bound upon the land and its owners before any development permits
are issued.  All instruments so recorded shall bear the signatures of the Clerk
of Council, the City Engineer, and the Zoning Administrator.
      (2)   Any performance bonds required to guarantee the performance of the
development during and after development shall be accepted by the City Clerk
before any development permits are issued.
   (b)   Building Permit.
      (1)   No development permits shall be issued until a Final Plan has been
approved by the City and recorded as described in this Section.
      (2)   Construction permits shall not be issued unless the plans
substantially conform to those approved by Council or changes to the plans are
mandated in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.  Any changes to a
planned development that are not approved by the Zoning Administrator shall
constitute a violation of the Zoning Code.
   (c)   Building Use or Occupancy.
      (1)   No building use or occupancy will be permitted until all public
utilities and streets have been accepted by Council, any private facilities
that serve the same purposes have been approved by the Service Director, and
all aspects of the final plan have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the
Zoning Administrator.  (Ord. 3520.  Passed 3-19-19.)
   1145.09  PERIOD OF VALIDITY.
   (a)   Preliminary Plan. A preliminary planned development approval shall be
valid for two (2) years. If an application for a final planned development has
not been filed within two (2) years, the preliminary planned development
approval is considered null and void. If the scope of the approved preliminary
plan has not changed and the proposed use and site plan still satisfy the
decision standards, the Planning Commission shall grant a one (1) year
extension. No more than two (2) extensions shall be granted.
 
   (b)     Final Plan. A final planned development approval shall be valid for
one (1) year. If an approved final planned development has not been
substantially established within one (1) year of its approval, or if
construction falls more than one (1) year behind the approved schedule, the
Zoning Administrator shall consider the approval null and void and shall not
issue any additional permits for the development. If the scope of the approved
final plan has not changed and the proposed use and site plan still satisfy the
decision standards, the Planning Commission shall grant a one (1) year
extension. No additional extensions shall be granted for the final planned
development. 
   (c)   Extension Procedure. No application materials are required; however,
the Zoning Administrator may request information he or she deems necessary for
the Planning Commission to make a decision. The Planning Commission shall
consider the request at its next regularly scheduled meeting. Such requests
will not require a public hearing.
(Ord. 3520.  Passed 3-19-19.)
   1145.10  CHANGES TO A PLANNED DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   Minor Changes to an Approved Final Planned Development.  The developer
of an approved final planned development may submit a written request for
approval of changes to the plan or development schedule.  The Zoning
Administrator and the Planning Commission Chair together may administratively
approve changes to a planned development if such changes:
      (1)   Do not change the use
      (2)   Are of a magnitude that will not substantially alter the appearance
of the development from off of the site
      (3)   Will not substantially or detrimentally affect the provision of
public services to the site or general vicinity
      (4)   Will not substantially or detrimentally increase potential demand
on public or private utilities
      (5)   Are not of a scope, scale, or character, that would cause a
negative impact on adjoining properties and neighborhood
      (6)   Are not contrary to and in no way diminish the intent of the
originally approved plan
   Administrative approvals shall be clearly documented, made part of the
original final planned development on file, and the details of any such changes
shall be reported to the Planning Commission at its next regularly scheduled
meeting.
   (b)   Major Changes to an Approved Planned Development. Any proposed changes
to an approved planned development that do not meet the criteria of a minor
change are considered a major change.  A major change requires an entirely new
preliminary planned development application (including the fee), according to
the provisions of this chapter.
   (c)   Changes to a Planned Development not Procedurally Approved.  An
existing planned development that was not approved according to the provisions
of this Chapter and was never approved by a legislative, quasi-judicial, or
administrative review, and that was legal at the time of its establishment is
considered an approved planned development and is subject to the provisions of
this chapter.  (Ord. 3520.  Passed 3-19-19.)
   1145.11  REAPPLICATION.
   (a)     No application for a planned development that is substantially
similar to an application that has been denied, wholly or in part, shall be
accepted for one year from the date of denial.  The Zoning Administrator shall
determine if a similar application differs enough to be considered a different
application and not subject to this section.  The Zoning Administrator may
consider factors such as the nature or size of a proposal, changes in the
development or traffic patterns of the area, or newly discovered evidence
pertinent to a decision on a previous application.  (Ord. 3520.  Passed 3-19-
19.)
   1145.12  DESIGN.
   (a)     Arrangement.  The physical arrangement of a planned development is
not subject to the specific dimensional regulations that apply in the
underlying zoning district, except as specifically noted in this Chapter.  Land
uses may be distributed throughout the site and throughout individual buildings
in whatever manner is best suited to a particular planned development. 
Structures, vehicle management areas, open spaces, landscaping, and other
elements may be distributed throughout the site in whatever manner is best
suited to a particular planned development and the surrounding area.
   (b)     Land Area.  A planned development shall be a minimum of one (1)
contiguous acre or more.
   (c)   Land Use.
      (1)   The following land uses are permitted in proportion to those
portions of a planned development that overlay an existing residential zoning
district:
         A.    Any land use permitted in any residential zoning district in
this Code, except Mobile Homes.
                 B.     Institutional, public, and semi-public land uses that
serve the planned development or the general public.
                 C.     Commercial land uses, if the total land area of the
planned development is greater than 10 acres and if the commercial land use is
intended to serve the planned development only.
          Such commercial land uses shall be limited as follows:
         1.   No signs that are visible from outside of the development.
         2.     No direct vehicular access to a public thoroughfare.
         3.   No less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the total land area
shall be devoted to residential land uses.
         4.   No separate structure intended to be used, in whole or part, for
commercial land uses shall be constructed prior to the construction of not less
than fifty percent (50%) of the dwelling units.
      (2)   The following land uses are permitted in proportion to those
portions of a planned development that overlay an existing commercial zoning
district:
         A.     Any land use permitted in the underlying zoning district.
         B.     Any land use permitted in any residential zoning district in
this Code, except Mobile Homes.
      (3)   The following land uses are permitted only in the portions of a
planned development that overlay an existing industrial zoning district:
         A.   Any land use permitted in the underlying zoning district.
      (4)   The land uses permitted in a planned development may be distributed
as follows:
         A.   If a single planned development overlays more than one zoning
district, then the land uses permitted according to this Section may be
distributed throughout the entire planned development site.
         B.   If a planned development includes land uses permitted only in an
industrial zoning district, then those land uses may only be located in that
portion of the planned development that overlays the industrially zoned land.
   (d)   Residential Density.  Residential density shall not exceed 110 percent
of the density permitted in the underlying zoning district.  Residential land
uses in a planned development that overlays a commercial zoning district shall
not exceed the density of the R1B Single-Family Medium-Density Residential
Zoning District.  Area devoted entirely to non-residential land uses, including
buildings, vehicle management areas, and other associated land use elements
shall be excluded from the area used to calculate residential density.
   (e)   Dimensional Regulations.
      (1)   Building Heights shall be limited as in the underlying zoning
district, regardless of land use.
      (2)   Front setbacks shall be limited as in the underlying zoning
district.
      (3)   All buildings and vehicle management areas shall be setback from
the perimeter of a planned development no less than:
         A.     Residential zoning district - 25 feet.
                 B.     Commercial zoning district - 25 feet.
                 C.     Industrial zoning district - 50 feet.
   (f)     Open Space.
            (1)     No planned development shall have less than twenty percent
(20%) open space, which includes any area not less than fifty (50) by fifty
(50) feet, not including the required setbacks, and includes nothing other than
natural area.
            (2)     Lot coverage shall be regulated according to the underlying
zoning district, except that lot coverage for the residential portion of any
planned development shall not exceed forty percent (40%).
   (g)       Sensitive Development Area.
            A.   A Sensitive Development Area is defined as any land(s) or soil
(s) proposed to be developed that, if subjected to improper use or management,
is otherwise determined to be incapable or unsuitable of urban use. Sensitive
Development Areas can also be considered those lands that pose special hazards
to development or the environment, consisting of lands or soils of such
sensitive character that they may require special use, design and engineering
restrictions.
            B.   For the Preliminary Planned Development, the applicant must
create an inventory of sensitive environmental area identified in subsection

Ecological Survey, and Environmental Site Assessment. Other documentation may
be required based on the site and the discretion of the Planning Commission,
including, but not limited to: Stream and Wetland Mitigation, Water Way
Permits, Archaeological Inventory, Historic Architecture Inventory. The
applicant must also provide reports of the analyses following current
professional norms for the discipline. It will be the Planning Commission's
role to review information submitted by the applicant on each discipline to
make the recommendations to City Council.
      D.   Design of the proposed Planned Development site shall be based on
the site information obtained from those public entities. To the maximum extent
practicable, development shall be located to preserve the natural features of
the site, to avoid areas of environmental sensitivity, and to minimize negative
impacts and alterations of natural features. The following specific areas shall
be preserved as undeveloped open space, and in accordance with the U.S. and
Ohio Constitutions and state or federal regulations:
         (1)   Unique and/or fragile areas, including wetlands, as may be

CHAPTER 1146
Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District
 
1146.01   Purpose and objectives.
1146.02   Uses permitted.
1146.03   Procedures.
1146.04   Effect of Overlay District.
1146.05   Amendments to an existing Overlay District.
   1146.01  PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   The Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District (hereinafter referred to as
"Overlay District"), R1A(O), R1B(O), R2A(O), R1MS(O), R2MS(O), R3MS (O) and MU
(O) is a zoning classification that permits owners of properties within R1A,
R1B, R2A, R1MS, R2MS, R3MS, and MU residential zoning districts to petition
City Council to establish an Overlay District and district use regulations in
their residential neighborhood in order to restrict rental use of one-family
dwellings. The Overlay District establishes restrictions intended to preserve
the attractiveness, desirability and privacy of residential neighborhoods by
precluding all or certain types of rental properties, thereby precluding the
deleterious effect rental properties can have on a neighborhood such as
property deterioration, increased density, congestion, and noise and traffic
levels leading to the reduction of property values. The goals of the Overlay
District are to allow owners of properties within residential neighborhoods to
control occupancy by unrelated persons in one-family dwellings within their
neighborhood. It is also the purpose of the Overlay District to achieve the
following objectives:
   (a)    To protect the privacy of residents and to minimize noise, congestion
and nuisance  impacts by regulating the types of rental properties,
particularly high-occupancy properties, occupied by unrelated persons.
   (b)    To maintain an attractive community appearance and provide a
desirable living    environment for residents by preserving the owner-occupied
character of the  neighborhood.
   (c)    To prevent excessive traffic and parking problems in the
neighborhoods.
      (Ord. 3187.  Passed 9-18-12.)
   1146.02  USES PERMITTED.
   Uses permitted in the R1A(O), R1B(O), R2A(O), R1MS (O), R2MS(O) R3MS(O) and
MU(O) Overlay District are as follows:
   (a)    Single family dwellings, except there shall not be more than two
unrelated persons residing in a dwelling unit, or where there are more than two
persons residing in a dwelling unit, persons classified as constituting a
family shall be limited to relations by blood, marriage or adoption, including
minor children in the lawful custody of an adult member.
   (b)    Anyone seeking the rights and privileges afforded a member of a
family by this code shall have the burden of proof by clear and convincing
evidence of their family relationship.
   (c)    Any other permitted and/or conditional uses of the underlying
district.
      (Ord. 3187.  Passed 9-18-12.)
   1146.03  PROCEDURES.
   The following procedures must be complied with in order to establish an
Overlay District.
   (a)    A petition requesting an Overlay District must be submitted to the
City Clerk on forms provided by the City Clerk. The petition requirements are
as follows:
      (1)   The petition must clearly describe the specific boundary where the
Overlay District is to be located.
      (2)   Each petition must be circulated by a person who owns property
within the proposed district and be signed by the circulator.
      (3)   The petition must contain the signatures and addresses of two-
thirds of parcel owners within the proper boundary of the Overlay District,
exclusive of public property. Jointly-owned parcels will be considered owned by
a single person for purposes of petitioning, and any co-owner may sign a
petition for such parcel. Only one owner of each parcel will count towards the
two-thirds requirement. If a person owns more than one parcel of property
within the proposed district, that person may sign the petition for each parcel
he or she owns.
      (4)   Each person signing the petition must also enter on the petition,
adjacent to their signature, the date the person signed the petition.
      (5)   The petition must accurately advise the signer of the restrictions
that would be imposed on the property if the Overlay District is established.
      (6)   The proposed boundary may not overlay a boundary of an existing
Overlay Districts or the boundary of an Overlay District that is already the
subject of an introduced ordinance pursuant to this section.
      (7)   When submitted, no signature dated earlier than six months prior to
the time the petition is filed with the City Clerk shall be counted in
determining the validity of the petition.
      (8)   A minimum of ten adjacent parcels must be included in the proposed
Overlay District, clearly bounded in a geographically logical way (for example
two adjacent block faces, an entire block, a cul-de-sac) that does not cross
any physical barrier in a single parcel extension fashion. In no instance shall
the proposed boundary create an island surrounded by the proposed district.
City Council may waive this minimum number of parcels/structure requirement,
but only after a positive recommendation from the Planning Commission.
   (b)   Upon presentation to the City Clerk for review, the Clerk shall verify
the signatures on the petition. If an insufficient number of signatures are
presented, the Clerk shall return the petition to the person filing the
petition and identify the valid and invalid signatures. If sufficient valid
signatures are presented, the Clerk shall refer the petition to the Community
Development Department, which shall within fifteen (15) days, determine whether
the petition is in conformity with the remaining conditions of this section.
      (1)   If the petition is determined to be in conformity with the
requirements of this section, the Clerk shall place this petition before the
City Council for acceptance by adopting a Resolution to refer this petition to
the Planning Commission for recommendations.
Upon receipt of a petition to establish an Overlay District, the Zoning
Administrator shall then place this matter before the Planning Commission at
the earliest possible meeting date, in accordance with the zoning map amendment
procedures set forth in Chapter
1135, Zoning Code Amendment. All procedure set forth in Chapter
1135 shall be followed.
      (2)   Decision Standards for considering Overlay District:
         A.   The proposed Overlay District meets the boundary criteria.
         B.   The proposed Overlay District will preserve and enhance the
neighborhood character.
         C.   The proposed Overlay District will promote the public health,
safety and general welfare of the people of the neighborhood.
         D.   The proposed Overlay District will promote and implement the
intent of the Comprehensive Plan.
         E.   The proposed Overlay District will satisfy a legitimate need.
      (3)   If the petition is not in conformity with the requirement of this
section, the Zoning Administrator shall reject the petition and return it to
the Clerk with a written explanation as to why the petition does not meet the
requirements of this section.  The Clerk shall then forward the petition and
the explanation to the person who filed the petition.
      (4)   If the petition is rejected for failure to comply with the boundary
requirements, it may be resubmitted with the corrected property boundary lines
and accompanied by certification that a copy of the petition and written notice
explaining the correction of the nonconformity was mailed to each property
owner affected by the change, notifying them their property was either added or
deleted from the petition and weather the correction to the boundary line means
the petition still meets all other requirements of the Code.
      (5)   If the petition is rejected for an insufficient number of valid
signatures, it may be  resubmitted with the additional signatures necessary for
compliance as long as the other signatures remain valid.
      (6)   Any resubmission after the initial petition has been rejected by
the City must be filed within 60 days from the date of receipt of the rejection
letter from the Clerk. Failure to meet this deadline shall constitute the
petition being denied.
   (c)   Subsequent to the petition to establish an Overlay District, the
circulator(s) of the petition for the proposed Overlay District or a majority
of those persons who signed the petition for an Overlay District may file a
written request with the City to table consideration of further proceedings
toward the adoption of the Overlay District for 60 days in order to allow the
submission of an alternate petition for a different boundary for the Overlay
District. After the public hearing, the Planning Commission shall make its
recommendations to City Council for legislative action. 
(Ord. 3187.  Passed 9-18-12.)
   1146.04  EFFECT OF OVERLAY DISTRICT.   
   (a)   Upon the passage of an ordinance by City Council establishing an
Overlay District, no initial rental unit license shall be issued to an owner of
property in the Overlay District that is inconsistent with the restrictions of
the Overlay District, and it shall be unlawful to use or allow any property to
be used except in conformity with requirements of the    underlying zoning
district and Overlay District.
   Any property in the Overlay District that has an existing rental housing
permit shall be allowed to continue its use and  occupancy in accordance with
the law existing prior to the date of the adoption of the  Overlay District. If
an owner surrounds an existing license or allows, either intentionally or
unintentionally, a license to remain expired for more than one year, any
subsequent use of the property shall be subject to the restrictions imposed by
the Overlay District.
   (b)   Except as set forth in Section
1146.03(c), if a petition pursuant to this section is denied, a subsequent
petition for an Overlay District that includes the same parcels may not be
filed for one year following the denial of the previous petition.
   (c)   Any Overlay District petition not adopted within six months of its
filing shall be deemed denied unless the petition was tabled or otherwise
delayed pursuant to  Section
1146.03(c).  (Ord. 3187.  Passed 9-18-12.)
   1146.05  AMENDMENTS TO AN EXISTING OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (a)   Adding Parcels to an Existing Overlay District.  Any number of
properties that are adjacent to an existing Overlay District may be added to
the district, and those property owners may file a petition and follow the
procedure as described in Section
1146.03. Those petitioned parcels will generally conform to the boundary
criteria as described in Section
1146.03(a)(8). The number of signatures required is based upon the total
parcels, including the existing Overlay District. The process is outlined in
Section
1146.03.
   (b)   Removing Parcels from an Existing Overlay District. Any property owner
of an existing Overlay District may petition to be removed from the Overlay
District. The number of signatures required is also based on the total parcels,
including the existing Overlay District. Those remaining parcels will generally
conform to the boundary criteria as described in Section
1146.03(a)(8).  The petition process is outlined in Section
1146.03.

      (1)   No application for a Conditional Use that is substantially similar
to an application that has been denied, wholly or in part, shall be accepted
for one year from the date denial.  The Zoning Administrator shall determine if
a similar application differs enough to be considered a different application
and not subject to this section.  The Zoning Administrator may consider factors
such as the nature or size of a proposal, changes in the development or traffic
patterns of the area, or newly discovered evidence pertinent to a decision on a
previous application.
      (2)   An applicant may appeal the decision of the Zoning Administrator
according to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (c)   Planning Commission Review. The Planning Commission shall base its
review of a proposed Conditional Use upon the complete application, upon any

sufficient information has been provided.
      (1)   Burden of Proof.
         A.   Planning Commission has no obligation to recommend approval and
City Council has no obligation to approve a Conditional Use.  This Zoning Code
assumes that the uses listed in this section are not appropriate unless an
applicant proves that the use will not be detrimental to the public health,
safety, or general welfare of the City or the neighborhood in which it is
proposed.
         B.   Applicants shall prove that potential negative impacts of
elements such as location, size and extent of facilities and operations, site
design, traffic generation, site access, and potential impact upon public
facilities will be adequately mitigated.
      (2)   General Decision Standards.  All Conditional Uses shall satisfy
these General Decision Standards.
         A.   The proposed use is in fact a Conditional Use appropriate for  in
the zoning district in which it is proposed.
         B.   The use and site will satisfy the general intent of this Zoning
Code.
         C.   The use and site will be compatible with the general intent of
the Comprehensive Plan.
         D.   The size and shape of the site are sufficient for the proposed
use.
         E.   The use will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or
potential future neighboring uses that are permitted in the zoning district.
         F.   The use will not involve activities, processes, materials,
equipment, or conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any person,
property, or the general welfare because of excessive production of traffic,
noise, smoke, fumes, glare, odors, or other emissions.
         G.   The only accessory uses will be directly related to the operation
of the principal use and will not be operated independent of the principal use.
         H.   The use and site will be adequately served by public facilities
and services such as streets, water and sewer, drainage structures, police and
fire protection, and refuse disposal, or adequate provisions will be made to
provide the same services privately.
         I.   Development of the site and operation of the use will not require
substantial public expenditure for additional infrastructure or services.
         J.   The site will be designed, constructed, and maintained in a
character harmonious in appearance and general character with the existing or
intended character of the general vicinity, and that such use will not change
the essential character of the same area.  Structures to be constructed,
reconstructed, or altered in a residential zoning district shall have the
appearance of residential buildings permitted in the zoning district.
         K.   The site is designed so that on-site traffic and traffic
accessing the site will not inappropriately impact the movement of traffic on
adjacent public streets.
         L.   Proposed construction will not result in the destruction, loss,
or damage of a natural, scenic, or historic feature of major importance.
         M.   All necessary permits and licenses for the Conditional Use and
its operation have been or can be obtained for the use at the proposed
location.
   (d)   Action by Planning Commission.
      (1)   The Planning Commission shall recommend to Council approval,
approval with conditions, or denial of an application as presented and shall
clearly state the findings upon which its recommendation is based.
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall base its recommendation to Council
upon how well the application satisfies the General Decision Standards and the
Decision Standards for the proposed use.  In its recommendation, Planning
Commission may waive or modify dimensional regulations of the Zoning Code, or
impose more strict regulations and any additional conditions, guarantees, and
safeguards it deems necessary to satisfy the purposes of this Zoning Code.
   (e)   Issuance and Revocation of Conditional Use Permit. The Zoning
Administrator shall issue a Conditional Use Permit after the Planning
Commission recommends and Council approves an application.  Construction
permits shall not be issued unless the plans substantially conform to those
approved by Council.  Any changes to a Conditional Use that are not approved by
the Zoning Administrator shall constitute a violation of the Zoning Code.
      (1)   Expiration and Reinstatement of Conditional Use Permit. A
Conditional Use Permit shall automatically expire if the Conditional Use ceases
operation for more than one year.  Expiration of a legal nonconforming
Conditional Use is subject to the provisions of Chapter
1137- Nonconformities.
      (2)   Period of Validity.
         A.   An approved Conditional Use must be substantially operational
within 2 years of its approval.  Applications for any construction permits
necessary for the operation of the Conditional Use must be filed within 1 year
of approval.
         B.   If an approved Conditional Use fails to meet these deadlines, the
applicant may request a time extension from the Planning Commission.  No
application materials are required, however, the Zoning Administrator may
request information he or she deems necessary for the Planning Commission to
make a decision.  Planning Commission will consider the request at its next
regularly scheduled meeting.  Such request does not require a public hearing.
         C.   If the scope of the approved Conditional Use has not changed and
the proposed use still satisfies the decision standards, the Planning
Commission shall grant a 6-month extension of time for compliance.  No more
than four such extensions may be granted.
      (3)   Revocation of Conditional Use Permit. A Conditional Use Permit may
be revoked by City Council upon an affirmative recommendation from the Planning
Commission if the existing Conditional Use Permit fails to meet one of the
following requirements:
         A.   The conditions of approval are not met or maintained.
         B.   The property ceases to be operated as an approved conditional
use.
         C.   The continuance of the conditional use would pose a substantial
risk to the public health, safety and welfare.
   (f)   Changes to a Conditional Use.
      (1)   Minor Changes to an approved Conditional Use.    An operator of an
approved Conditional Use may submit a written request for approval of changes
to the site or operating conditions of the use.  The Zoning Administrator may
administratively approve changes to a Conditional Use if such changes:
         A.   Do not change the use.
         B.   Are of a magnitude that will not substantially alter the
appearance of the use from off of the site.
         C.   Will not substantially or detrimentally affect the provision of
public services to the site or general vicinity.
         D.   Will not substantially or detrimentally increase potential demand
on public or private utilities.
         E.   Are not of a scope, scale, or character, that would cause a
negative impact on adjoining properties and neighborhood.
         F.   Are not contrary to and in no way diminish the intent of the
originally approved permit.
Administrative approvals shall be clearly documented and made part of the
original Conditional Use permit on file.
      (2)   Major Changes to an Approved Conditional Use.      Any changes to
an approved conditional use that do not meet the criteria of a minor change are
considered a major change.  A major change requires an entirely new Conditional
Use application (including the fee), according to the provisions of this
chapter.
      (3)   Changes to a Conditional Use not procedurally approved. An existing
use that is listed in this code as a Conditional Use, that is in a zoning
district where such use in permitted as a Conditional Use, that was never
approved by a legislative, quasi-judicial, or administrative review, and that
was legal at the time of its establishment is considered an approved
Conditional Use and is subject to the provisions of this chapter.
   An existing use that is listed in this code as a Conditional Use and is in a
zoning district where such use is not permitted is considered a legal
nonconformity.  Any proposed changes to such uses are subject to the provisions
of Chapter
1137.

   1149.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)   The regulations of this section are intended to minimize the traffic
impacts of development on public streets and to assure that all developments
adequately and safely provide storage and movement of vehicles in a manner
consistent with good site design and site engineering practices without
creating excessive amounts of parking spaces.  This section regulates off-
street parking and loading, handicapped accessibility, and vehicular access
from public streets.
   (b)   This section includes provisions that are intended to minimize
potential nuisance to adjacent properties by limiting light pollution,
minimizing dust and debris, improving public safety and managing storm water
run-off.
   (c)   This section includes provisions which are intended to benefit the
community by minimizing vehicular and pedestrian conflicts in parking lots,
reducing the urban heat island effect, fostering air and water quality,
promoting alternative modes of transportation and maximizing the efficient use
of land.  (Ord. 3307.  Passed 3-17-15.)
   1149.02  APPLICABILITY OF REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Any new development, redevelopment, or change to a use or structure or
site (whether conforming or nonconforming) shall meet the current parking and
site access regulations for the entire use and structure and site. Any
nonconforming uses, structures or sites shall follow the provisions in Chapter
1137.
   (b)   All residential uses of more than three dwelling units must meet the
non-residential parking requirements (see Section
1149.05) except for the number of parking spaces required.
   (c)   All uses in a mixed-use structure or lot must comply with the
requirements for non-residential uses.
   1149.03  GENERAL REGULATIONS.
   (a)   All off-street parking and maneuvering areas shall be hard surfaced
(includes concrete, asphalt, brick, stone, or bonded gravel).  Loose materials
are not permitted.  The Zoning Administrator in collaboration with the City
Engineer may allow alternative standards, such as for porous paving, if they
satisfy the general intent of all other provisions of this section.
   (b)   All off-street parking shall be located on the same site as the use
for which it is required or intended except that off-site parking may be
permitted by a Conditional Use Permit according to procedures set forth in
Section
1147. Shared-use parking may be permitted by Conditional Use Permit according
to procedures set forth in Section
1147.
   
   (c)   All off-street parking spaces shall contain a  minimum sized
rectangular area. Standard spaces are 9 feet wide by 18 feet long. Compact
spaces are 8 feet wide by 16 feet long. The tables below outline the non-
residential parking lot minimum dimensional requirements for the spaces and
aisles based on angle

compliance must also be demonstrated.
            3.   Identification. Pedestrian walkways shall be clearly
differentiated from driveways, parking aisles, and parking and loading spaces
through the use of elevation changes, a different paving material, or similar
method. Surface striping alone, is insufficient.
            4.   Separation. Where a pedestrian walkway is parallel and
adjacent to an auto travel lane, it must be raised and separated from the auto
travel lane by a raised curb at least 6 inches high, decorative bollards, or
other physical barrier.
      (5)   Bicycle and Motorcycle Parking.
         A.    Bicycle Parking.
            1.    Spaces Required.
               a.   Bicycle parking is required for multi-unit residential
buildings and nonresidential development. Unless otherwise expressly stated,
buildings and uses subject to bicycle parking requirements must provide at
least 3 bicycle parking spaces or at least 1 bicycle space per 10 on-site
vehicle parking spaces actually provided, whichever is greater. After the first
50 bicycle parking spaces are provided, the required number of additional
bicycle parking spaces is 1 space per 20 vehicle parking spaces. Covered spaces
are strongly encouraged.
               b.   The requirements of subsection a, above, notwithstanding,
the following minimum bicycle parking requirements apply to colleges,
universities, schools and libraries:
                  i.   Elementary and junior high school: 1 bicycle parking
space per 1000 square feet;
                  ii.   High school: 1 bicycle parking space per 1500 square
feet;
                  iii.   Colleges and universities: 1 bicycle parking space per
5 vehicle parking spaces provided; and
                  iv.   Libraries: 1 bicycle space per 5 vehicle parking spaces
provided.
            2.    Design and Location.
               a.    General. Required bicycle parking spaces must:
                  i.   Consist of racks or lockers anchored so that they cannot
be easily removed and of solid construction, resistant to rust, corrosion,
hammers, and saws;
                  ii.   Allow both the bicycle frame and the wheels to be
locked using a standard U-lock;
                  iii.   Be designed so as not to cause damage to the bicycle;
                  iv.   Facilitate easy locking without interference from or to
adjacent bicycles and maintain a separation of at least 24 inches from the
nearest wall; and
                  v.   Be located in close proximity to entrances and other
high activity areas, highly visible, active, well-lighted areas without
interfering with pedestrian movements.
               b.   Size. Required bicycle parking spaces for nonresidential
uses must have minimum dimensions of 2 feet in width by 6 feet in length, with
a minimum overhead vertical clearance of 7 feet.
               c.   Location. Required bicycle parking may be located indoors
or outdoors. Such spaces must be located out of the ROW unless an encroachment
agreement is approved. If required bicycle parking facilities are not visible
from the abutting street or the building's main entrance, signs must be posted
indicating their location.
         B.   Motorcycle and Scooter Parking. For any nonresidential use
providing 50 or more off-street spaces, a maximum of 2 required off-street
parking spaces per 50 vehicle spaces may be reduced in size or otherwise
redesigned to accommodate parking for motorcycles and scooters. When provided,
motorcycle and scooter parking must be identified by a sign. Motorcycle and
Scooter parking shall be counted concurrently as part of the minimum number of
vehicle spaces required for the development.
      (6)    Landscaping.
         A.   Purpose.
            1.   Trees and other vegetation help to limit the negative effects
of large, paved areas by improving stormwater control, reducing erosion,
avoiding unnatural microclimates, and improving aesthetics.  This section
requires minimum landscaping requirements to satisfy this purpose.
         B.   Trees and Landscaped Areas
            1.   Trees
               a.   A parking area shall have 2 trees per parking facility plus
1 tree for every 5 parking spaces or fraction thereof generally distributed
throughout the parking area.  Any dead or severely diseased trees used to
fulfill these regulations shall be replaced at the request of the Zoning
Administrator.
               b.   Trees shall be selected for the local soil and climate. The
area and soil depth of the site shall be adjusted to sustain the tree.
Immediately following planting, each tree shall be a minimum of 6 feet tall and
have a minimum 2-inch caliper.  At maturity, each tree shall have a clear trunk
at least four feet above the adjacent parking surface and average mature crown
greater than 12 feet.
               c.   Each existing tree that meets the minimum regulations for a
newly planted tree shall count as 1 tree.
               d.   Each newly planted or existing tree with a minimum 6-inch
diameter at breast height that is in a living and healthy condition shall count
as 2 trees.
         C.   Landscaped areas.  All areas that are not paved shall be
landscaped and shall satisfy the following regulations:
            1.   Shrubs, vines, and ground cover shall be healthy stock.
            2.   Shrubs shall be a minimum of 1 gallon.
            3.   Shrubs shall be maintained so that their height does not
exceed 3 feet above the adjacent parking surface.
            4.   Lawn grass shall be a species common to Southwest Ohio.  Sod
shall be used in areas subject to erosion.
            5.   Synthetic or artificial lawns or plants may not be used in
lieu of plant requirements.
            6.   Concrete and asphalt shall not be used in landscaped areas. 
Decorative aggregate and other pervious surfaces may be used in landscaped
areas if approved by the Zoning Administrator.
         D.   Alternate design plan.  If the design regulations in this chapter
will not result in an appropriate parking area for the site on which a use is
located or proposed, a property owner may apply to the Planning Commission for
a Conditional Use Permit to approve an Alternate Design Plan per procedure in
Section
1147.

   1151.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)    The purpose of this Chapter is to regulate the display of signs that
pertain to residential and nonresidential land uses and activities that take
place on the same site as where the sign is located. These regulations are
intended to:
      (1)   Provide property owners and occupants an opportunity for effective
identification.
      (2)   Maintain and enhance the quality of the City's appearance by
limiting the number, sign face area, total area, location, and design of signs
permitted on all sites.
      (3)   Protect residential zoning districts from the adverse impacts of
excessive signs both from within residential districts and from surrounding
districts.
      (4)   Reduce sign clutter.
      (5)   Ensure that signs are located and designed to maintain a safe and
orderly pedestrian and vehicular environment.
      (6)   Provide reasonable and appropriate methods to identify goods sold
or produced and services rendered in all zoning districts.
      (7)   Control the size, location, and design of temporary and permanent
signs so that the appearance of such signs will be aesthetically harmonious
with their surroundings and will enhance the overall appearance of the built
environment.
      (8)   Eliminate any conflict that could be hazardous between private
signs and traffic control devices and signs.
      (9)   Preserve and perpetuate uncluttered and natural views, significant
architecture, and cultural resources for the enjoyment and environmental
enrichment of the Oxford residents and visitors. 
         (Ord. 3365.  Passed 8-16-16.)
   1151.02  ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)    Interpretation and Enforcement.  The Zoning Administrator shall
interpret and enforce this chapter. Appeal from the decision of the Zoning
Administrator may be made to the Board of Zoning Appeals.

Chapter
1137, Nonconformities, Section
1137.10, Nonconforming Signs.
   (c)   Zoning Inspections.  The Zoning Administrator is authorized to inspect
any sign for compliance with this Code at any time.
   (d)   Installation and Maintenance.  All signs shall be installed in a
workmanlike manner and shall not be allowed to exist in a state of disrepair,
which includes dysfunctional lighting, broken glass and plastic, rotted wood,
peeling paint or vinyl, missing parts, rust, illegibility, and the like. The
Zoning Administrator shall order the removal or repair of any sign that does
not meet this standard after giving proper notice.
   (e)   Construction.
      (1)   No sign shall be constructed of highly flammable materials.
      (2)   Any glass other than that contained in incandescent bulbs,
fluorescent bulbs or neon tubing which form part of any sign shall be comprised

any of the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor pursuant
to Oxford Code Section
501.99. Each day's continuance of a violation shall be considered a separate
offense.
   (g)   Identification of Permanent Signs.  Every permanent sign for which a
permit is issued according to these regulations shall be plainly marked with
the name of the responsible party and the permit number for the sign. Except
for legal nonconforming signs, failure to display such information as required
is prima facie evidence that the sign is a violation of this Code.
   (h)   Invalid Signs. A sign, whether conforming or nonconforming, that
displays a commercial message that applies to an entity no longer in operation
or to goods or services no longer provided shall be completely removed or the
sign face replaced with a blank face within 45 days of such discontinuation of
operation, sales, or service. The sign, sign structure, and mounting hardware
must be removed in its entirety if a legal operation, sales, or service is not
reinstated or established within 2 years of the original date of such
discontinuation.
   (i)   Applications and Permits.
      (1)   The application requirements, permitting procedure, and issuance of

regulation provided in this Code. Signs that are exempted from the permit
requirement of this Code are not counted towards the total sign area permitted
for a site or nonresidential occupant.
      (2)   Where this Code regulates the total sign area or the sign face area
of a sign based upon the site or structure relative to an adjacent public
right-of-way, the following provisions apply:
         A.   If a site abuts only one public right-of-way, the area
regulations are based upon only that right-of-way.
         B.   If a site abuts more than one public right-of-way, the number and
area regulations are based upon all rights-of-way, however, the sign number and
area permitted based upon each right-of-way shall only be oriented towards the
right-of-way upon which the permitted sign area is based.

   (i)   "Modification, Major" means any construction of a new, independent
structure; construction or other alteration or addition that changes the square
footage of an existing structure; construction or other alteration that changes
the architectural style of an existing structure or portion thereof; any
removal of important stylistic features such as chimneys, latticework, gables,
barge board gingerbread, soffets, shutters, windows, and doors; alteration of
exterior surfaces such as wood to vinyl and painting unpainted surfaces.
   (j)   "Modification, Minor" means any construction or alteration that does
not change the architectural style of an existing structure and is not a major
modification; repair or update of any exterior element to comply with current
building code, including ADA, shall be considered a minor modification for the
purposes of this chapter.
   (k)   "Municipal Infrastructure" means publicly owned, maintained, or
operated property including utilities, streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks,
utility poles, street lights, traffic control signs, metering devices, and
appurtenances thereto. Objects placed upon publicly owned property such as
bicycle racks, waste receptacles, tables, benches, recreation equipment,
vending machines, and other similar devices can be considered municipal
infrastructure.  Wholly or partially enclosed structures shall not be
considered municipal infrastructure for the purposes of this chapter.
   (l)   "Neglect" means a situation in which property owners, or others having
legal possession, custody, or control of a property, allow the condition of the
property to suffer such deterioration, potentially beyond the point of repair,
as to threaten the structural integrity of the structure.
   (m)   "Non-Contributing" means any structure which has no architectural
merit, no historic events or persons connected with it and which would not
adversely affect the surrounding architectural or cultural streetscape if it
were removed. Generally buildings in this category will be fifty (50) or fewer
years of age. The loss of the building would not have a negative impact on the
historic character of the district. The loss of the building would improve the
consistency and cohesion of the historic district.
   (n)   "Non-Historic Contributing" Generally buildings in this category will
be fifty (50) or fewer years of age. The façade of the building conforms to the
general character of the street wall in height, massing, proportion,
fenestration, material, color, and detail. The building is in balance with the
historic buildings in the district context and neither overwhelms nor
detrimentally alters the historic character of the district. If the building
does not conform stylistically to the character of the district, it
nevertheless stands in an appropriate dialogue with the context. The building
is typologically appropriate to the district.
   (o)   "Ordinary Repairs and Maintenance" means replacement of any part of a
property where the purpose and effect of such work and replacement is to
correct or prevent any deterioration or decay to such property, or any part
thereof, and to restore same, as nearly as may be practicable, to its original
condition and appearance, including minor repair of exterior surfaces including
caulking, repointing, and nonabrasive cleaning.
   (p)   "Owner" means the owner of record and the term shall include the
plural as well as the singular.
   (q)   "Pre-Application Review" means a review of the ideas, principles, and
general standards behind a proposed modification; a less detailed examination
of a proposed modification than is required for a Certificate of
Appropriateness.
   (r)   "Preservation" means the act or process of applying measures necessary
to sustain the existing form, integrity, and materials of an historic property.
Work, including preliminary measures to protect and stabilize the property,
generally focuses upon the ongoing maintenance and repair of historic materials
and features rather than extensive replacement and new construction.
   (s)   "Reconstruction" means the act or process of depicting, by means of
new construction, the form, features, and detailing of a non-surviving site,
landscape, building, structure, or object for the purpose of replicating its
appearance at a specific period of time and in its historic location. This
definition shall only apply to the use of the term "reconstruction" within this
chapter.
   (t)   "Rehabilitation" means the act or process of making possible a
compatible use for a property through repair, alterations, and additions while
preserving those portions or features which convey its historical, cultural, or
architectural values.
   (u)   "Restoration" means the act or process of accurately depicting the
form, features, and character of a property as it appeared at a particular
period of time by means of the removal of features from other periods in its
history and reconstruction of missing features from the restoration period. The
limited and sensitive upgrading of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems
and other code-required work to make properties functional is appropriate
within a restoration project.

      (Ord. 3530.  Passed 6-4-19.)
   1152.06  DESIGNATION OF HISTORIC SITES AND DISTRICTS.
   The HAPC has the authority to initiate a process to designate historic sites
or districts for preservation under the rules and standards of this chapter.
The purpose of this section is to establish the criteria for designation and
the procedure for such designations.
   (a)   Designation Criteria.  In considering any area, place, structure, work
of art, or object in Oxford as a historic site or a historic district, the
latter of which may contain a combination of historic, historic non-
contributing, or non-historic contributing sites, structures, buildings, or
places worthy of preservation shall find that two of the following criteria are
satisfied.
      (1)   The character of the site or district has value or significance as
part of the history or development of Oxford, the State of Ohio, or the United
States;
      (2)   It is the location or site of a historic event;         
      (3)   It is identified with a person or persons who contributed to the
history of development of Oxford, the State of Ohio, or the United States;
      (4)   It embodies distinguishing characteristics of an architectural
style or building type;
      (5)   It exemplifies the cultural, economic, social, educational, or
political heritage of Oxford;
      (6)   Its relationship to other distinctive areas or structures
designated for preservation requires designation to protect and preserve the
previously designated site; or
      (7)   Its unique location or singular physical characteristic represents
an established and familiar visual feature of Oxford.
   (b)   Designation Procedure.
      (1)   Step 1 - Notification.
         A.   If the HAPC decides to propose designation of any area, place,
structure, work of art, or object in Oxford as a historic site or historic
district, the HAPC shall instruct the Historic Preservation Administrator to
notify property owners in accordance with this section.
         B.   The Historic Preservation Administrator shall notify the owner of
record of all properties under consideration for designation or any person
having a recorded legal interest in such property or properties.
         C.   The notification shall include information on the dates, times,
and location of the HAPC public meeting.
      (2)   Step 2 - HAPC Review and Recommendation.
         A.   The HAPC shall hold a public meeting regarding the proposed
designation.
         B.   If the HAPC decides that a designation is appropriate, they shall
make such a recommendation to the Planning Commission for the initiation of a
zoning map amendment to both establish the formal designation and to amend the
zoning map to show the designation as an overlay zoning district on the zoning
map.
      (3)   Step 3 - Forwarding to Planning Commission.
         A.   Once the HAPC recommends the designation of a historic site or
district, the Planning Commission shall initiate a zoning map amendment process
in order to formally consider the designation.
         B.   The Planning Commission and City Council shall hear the proposed
amendment and designation in accordance with the procedure set forth in the
Zoning Map Amendment Section of this code, including all notification
requirements for public hearings.
         C.   The Planning Commission and City Council shall consider the
designation criteria as part of the recommendation and decision to designate a
historic site or historic district, in addition to the general criteria for
approving a zoning map amendment.
         D.   If the City Council approves the designation and zoning map
amendment, the site or district shall be so identified on the Official Zoning
Map.
(4)   Step 4 - Notification of Designation.  Within ten (10) days of the
passage of said ordinance, the Historic Preservation Administrator shall send
by registered mail a certified copy of the designation ordinance and a notice
briefly stating the fact of said designation and identifying where the owner of
record  can locate the information from this chapter, any applicable design
guidelines, and any applicable historic inventories.
   (c)   Rescinding of Designation.
      (1)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, Council may
rescind the designation of any area, place, building or structure as a historic
site or historic district by ordinance.
      (2)   Passage of such ordinance shall relieve the owner or owners from
any duties or penalties connected with this chapter. 
      (3)   Council shall not pass such an ordinance without first proposing by
motion that the designation of an area, place, structure, work of art or object
in Oxford be rescinded and removed and notifying the HAPC to that effect.
      (4)   Council shall not pass such an ordinance until the procedures
required by Subsections above, to make a designation have been applied in the
case of removal and rescinding of such a designation. 
   (d)   Determining the Significance of a Structure and Related Applicability.
      (1)   When making decisions or recommendations about changes to
structures subject to the COA requirement, the HAPC shall have the authority to
make a determination of the historical or architectural significance of the
structure based on this section.
      (2)   In cases where there is an adopted historic inventory, the HAPC
shall utilize the information in the historic inventory to make a determination
of the significance (historic, non-historic contributing, historic non-
contributing, and non-contributing).
      (3)   Where a historic inventory has not been adopted, the HAPC shall
determine whether a structure or site is historic, non-historic contributing,
historic non-contributing, and non-contributing based on the structure's or
site's:
         A.   Value as a reminder of the cultural, historical, or
archaeological heritage of the City, State, or nation;
         B.   Location as a site of a significant local, State, or national
event;
         C.   Identification with a person or persons who significantly
contributed to the development of the City, State, or nation;
         D.   Identification as the work of a master builder, designer, or
architect whose individual work has influenced the City, State, or nation;
         E.   Value as a building that is recognized for the quality of its
architecture and that it retains sufficient elements showing such architectural
significance;
         F.   Example of an architectural style or period; and/or
         G.   Character as a contributing element in the applicable historic
district.
         For structures that the HAPC finds are historic non-contributing or
non-contributing, the HAPC may relax or waive the standards or guidelines that
apply to the project. 
If the HAPC finds that the structure is historic or non-historic contributing,
the standards and guidelines of this code may be fully applied at the
discretion of the HAPC.
         (Ord. 3530.  Passed 6-4-19.)
   1152.07  CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of the Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) is
to provide a procedure by which to review construction, renovation,
reconstruction, expansion, and demolition projects on designated historic
structures or within historic districts. In an effort to preserve the character
of this area, the City has established reasonable development standards and
design guidelines for buildings and structures within the district and this
procedure allows for a comprehensive review of the activities against the
adopted standards and guidelines.
   (b)   Applicability.
      (1)   No person shall carry out any exterior alteration, addition,
restoration, reconstruction, demolition, removal of exterior architectural
elements, construction that alters the architectural style of existing
structures, new construction, or moving of a site, structure, or building that
is a designated historic site or that is within a historic district without an
approved COA. Furthermore, no changes in appearance of such property or
structure including, but not limited to, its light fixtures, signs, awnings,
windows, siding, roof, doors, shutters, sidewalks, latticework, decorative
trim, fences, walls, retaining walls, steps, soffits, paving, or other exterior
elements which affect the appearance and cohesiveness of the historic site or
historic district, without first obtaining an approved COA in accordance with
this section.
      (2)   If the Historic Preservation Administrator and the HAPC Chair
determine a proposed municipal infrastructure improvement impacts the historic
or architectural environment of a historic district, a COA shall be required.
      (3)   Site improvements such as the establishment of a parking lot or
structure, landscaping, or other site work shall also be subject to this
section unless otherwise waived by the HAPC.
      (4)   Projects and activities that are exempt from the design review
process are the following:
         A.   Ordinary repair and maintenance of a building or structure which
does not change or alter the exterior appearance of the building or structure;
         B.   Changes in occupancy not involving structural or exterior work;
         C.   Interior electrical wiring, HVAC or plumbing work on an existing
structure;
         D.   Interior building renovations which will not alter and/or affect
the exterior elevations and facade of the building or structure or any
architectural features that are visible from the outside, unless otherwise
prohibited in (Minimum Maintenance Standards).
      (5)   There shall be a non-refundable filing fee attached to the
application for a COA, payable in advance.
   
   (c)   Review Authority.
      (1)   All applications for a COA shall be subject to review by the HAPC
in accordance with Section unless an administrative approval is allowed under
the following conditions:
         A.   Applications where the applicant proposes replacement of an
architectural element or feature with a similar feature where there is no
change in color, material, or size; or
         B.   Where the HAPC Chair and Historic Preservation Administrator
jointly agree that the proposed modification(s) are minor and comply with all
applicable standards and guidelines.
      (2)   In cases where an administrative approval of the COA is allowed
above, the Historic Preservation Administration shall have the authority to
forward an application to the HAPC for review if he or she cannot determine if
the proposed work is minor enough to allow administrative review under this
chapter.
      (3)   All COAs that are approved administratively shall be placed on the
next regular HAPC meeting agenda to ensure that the full HAPC and the public
are aware of such administrative approvals.
   (d)   Procedure for Administrative Decision on a COA.
      (1)   Step 1 - Application.
         A.   The applicant shall submit a formal application for COA review,
including any applicable fees.
         B.   An application for a COA shall not be considered until it the
application is complete. An application shall be considered when all required
and pertinent information has been provided and when all required fees have
been paid. A complete application shall consist of:
            1.   The completed application form;
            2.   Applicable non-refundable filing fee, payable in advance;
            3.   Diagrams, site plans, elevations, illustrations, photo
simulations, and written descriptions sufficient to describe and visualize the
location and proposed modification of the property and structure; and
            4.   Written descriptions of the proposed modifications that
require a COA.
            5.   The Historic Preservation Administrator may require additional
information or materials as necessary.
      (2)   Step 2 - Historic Preservation Administrator Review and Decision.
         A.   Within thirty (30) days after the application is determined to be
complete, the Historic Preservation Administrator shall make a decision on the
application. In making its decision, the Historic Preservation Administrator
may approve or deny the application.
         B.   Prior to making a decision on the application, the Historic
Preservation Administrator shall have the authority to provide comments to the
applicant regarding necessary revisions to bring the application into full
compliance. The application shall not be deemed formally approved until the
applicant makes all of the appropriate changes and submits all necessary
revised forms, maps, and documents to the Historic Preservation Administrator.
   (e)   Procedure of a HAPC Decision of a COA.
      (1)   Step 1 - Pre-Application Meeting.
         A.   A pre-application shall be required for all COA applications that
involve a demolition request and all applications that involve new construction
of principal buildings.
         B.   A pre-application shall be required for all other applications
but for those applications, the meeting may be waived if the Historic
Preservation Administrator and HAPC Chair make a preliminary determination that
the application appears to be in keeping with the required standards and design
guidelines.
         C.   A pre-application shall not be required for an application for a
structure or site that is classified as non-contributing in a historic
inventory adopted by the City of Oxford.
         D.   The pre-application meeting shall be an opportunity for an
applicant and the HAPC to discuss a proposal prior to the applicant expending
significant considerable amounts of time and money on design, surveying, and
engineering.
         E.   The pre-application may consist of any information the applicant
considers useful to the HAPC.  The HAPC shall not take any formal action on the
application during the pre-application meeting. The applicant shall submit the
information to the Historic Preservation Administrator for placement on the
agenda for the next regularly scheduled meeting of the HAPC.
         F.   Any discussions held during the pre-application meeting are not
binding on the City and do not constitute official assurances or
representations by the City or its officials regarding any aspects of the plan
or application discussed.
      (2)   Step 2 - Application.
         A.   The applicant shall submit a formal application for COA review,
including any applicable fees. An application for a COA shall not be considered
until it the application is complete.. 
         B.   After the application is determined to be complete, it shall be
placed on the agenda for the next regularly scheduled HAPC meeting (or within
forty-five (45) days).
         C.   The HAPC shall set forth the time and the place of the public
meeting and shall give written notice to the applicant  of the time, date and
place of said meeting, and the HAPC shall give public notice of the same.
      (3)   Step 3 - HAPC Review.
         A.   The HAPC shall act upon each application within sixty (60) days
of its first HAPC meeting unless consideration has been continued beyond such
period by official action, in which case the HAPC shall act within a reasonable
time and as soon as is practical.
         B.   Following approval, approval with modifications, or denial of a
COA, the Historic Preservation Administrator shall inform the applicant of the
HAPC decision by first class mail within ten (10) days.
         C.   A denial of the application may be appealed in accordance with
this Chapter.
   (f)   COA Review Criteria.
      (1)   Decisions on a COA application shall be based on consideration of
the following criteria:
         A.   The proposed development complies with all the requirements of
this code and other related codes and ordinances enforced by the City;
         B.   Properties which contribute to the character of the historic
district shall be retained, with their historic architectural features intact
and altered as little as possible;
         C.   Any alteration of an existing property shall be compatible with
its historic character, as well as with the surrounding district;
         D.   New construction shall be compatible with the district in which
it is located;
         E.   The application demonstrates compliance with any historic
guidelines or policies adopted by the City of Oxford that are applicable to the
subject application; and
         F.   In determining compatibility, the HAPC shall consider the
following:
            1.   The general design, character, and appropriateness to the
property of the proposed alteration or new construction;
            2.   The scale of the proposed alteration or new construction in
relation to the property itself, surrounding properties, and the neighborhood;
         G.   The texture, materials, and color and their relation to similar
features of other properties in the neighborhood;
         H.   The visual compatibility with surrounding properties, including
proportion of the properties façade, roof shape, and the rhythm of spacing of
properties on streets, including setback; and
         I.   The importance of historic, architectural, or other features to
the significance of the property.
      (2)   In its considerations of whether an application is deserving of an
approval, the HAPC may also consider the cost of modifications or other
proposals, where costs for a particular action or inaction may be unreasonable
given existing conditions of a structure, site, or area.
      (3)   The HAPC shall encourage alterations and repairs to historic
structures and to structures in historic districts in the spirit of their
existing architectural style; however, additions in styles different than the
existing structure may be approved if such additions complement the existing
architectural style.  The HAPC shall be flexible in its judgment of plans for
alteration, repair, or demolition of structures, sites, and areas of little
historic or cultural value except where such alteration, repair, or demolition
would seriously impair the historic value and character of surrounding
structures or of the surrounding area.  It is not the intent of this Chapter to
limit alteration or repair to any one period of architectural style.
   (g)   Bond Requirement.  Before any building permit for any new principal
building is issued a performance bond is required with security equivalent to
100% of the approved cost of leveling the site, filling with soil and sodding
or seeding the surface.
   (h)   Amendment or Modifications after an Approval.  Unless otherwise stated
in this chapter, any request for an amendment or modification to the approved
plans or conditions shall be done in accordance with the procedures and
standards established for its original approval. 
   (i)   Validity.
      (1)   The COA shall be valid for a period of one (1) year from the date
of approval by the HAPC at which time a building permit must be obtained
      (2)   All work shall be substantially completed within two (2) years from
the date a building permit is issued.
      (3)   The HAPC may approve an alternative construction schedule for it's
COA approval
      (4)   Failure to comply with any of the above deadlines shall render the
COA void and no alternations or construction may take place until a new COA has
been approved in accordance with this section.
   (j)   COA Decisions Related to Other Permits and Approvals. 
      (1)   No permits for zoning, building, or demolition shall be issued
without first obtaining a COA.
      (2)   If a COA is approved, permits relative to the proposed
modifications may be issued immediately following normal zoning and building
department review procedures.
      (3)   If a COA is denied, the City shall not issue any permits that would
allow modifications for which the COA was denied. 
   (k)   Resubmission of a COA Application.
      (1)   An application that is denied or approved-with-modifications shall
not be resubmitted for one year unless the applicant demonstrates that the new
application addresses all of the issues or concerns established in the denial
or that the new application is substantively different from the initial
application.
      (2)   The HAPC Chair and Historic Preservation Administrator shall
determine if the changes are substantial enough to warrant a new review.
         (Ord. 3530.  Passed 6-4-19.)
   1152.08  MOVING OF HISTORIC STRUCTURES.
   (a)   The HAPC may authorize the moving of a historic structure or structure
in a historic district through a COA application.
   (b)   The HAPC may approve a COA for the moving of a structure within a
historic district if the move will enhance the character of the overall
district.
   (c)   The HAPC may approve a COA for the moving of a structure to a property
outside of the historic district provided that:
      (1)   There is a determination that the structure is identified as
historic non-contributing or non-contributing in an adopted historic inventory;
or
      (2)   That while the structure is historic or non-historic contributing,
as identified in an adopted historic inventory, that the reuse of the property
where the structure was located will enhance the character and quality of the
historic district as compared to the structure that is proposed to be moved.
         (Ord. 3530.  Passed 6-4-19.)
   1152.09  DEMOLITION REVIEW AND REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Application.
      (1)   An application for the demolition of a building shall require a COA
and follow the procedures and requirements of Oxford and Ohio Building Codes.
      (2)   Any application for demolition shall include a plan for the reuse
of the property that illustrates the mitigation of any adverse effects of the

   1152.13  APPEAL.
   (a)   An applicant may appeal the denial of a COA to the Board of Zoning
Appeals (BZA) within twenty-one (21) days of the date of such denial.  The BZA
shall consider the appeal at its next regularly scheduled meeting or within
forty-five (45) days. Consideration of an appeal is not a public hearing and
does not require legal notice.
   (b)   An official transcript of the meeting or meetings at which the
application was considered must be provided to the BZA at the cost of the
appellant and the appeal shall be limited to the transcript of the HAPC
hearing.  No new claims or evidence shall be heard and no additional testimony
shall be permitted.

   1153.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the City of Oxford, County of Butler, State of Ohio does
ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.
      (1)    The flood hazard areas of the City of Oxford are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions that increase flood heights and velocities in areas of special
flood hazards and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately flood proofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of
such damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these
regulations are adopted.
    (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote
the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed
to:
      (1)    Protect human life and health;
      (2)    Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)    Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)    Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)    Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)    Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use
and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)    Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Losses.  In order to accomplish its
purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
      (1)    Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)    Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)    Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
flood waters;
      (4)    Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development
which may increase flood damage; and
      (5)    Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
      (6)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (7)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (9)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (10)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program. 
(Ord. 3128.  Passed 10-19-10.)
 
   1153.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
   (a)   'Accessory structure' means a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   'Appeal' means a request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
   (c)   'Base Flood' means the flood having a one (1%) percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to
as the one (1%) percent chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   'Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)'   The water surface elevation
of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988,
and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).

areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   'Federal Emergency Management Agency' (FEMA)  means the agency with
the overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance
Program.
   (j)   'Fill' A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   'Flood' or 'flooding' means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)    The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)    The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source.
   (l)   'Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)' Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   'Flood Insurance Rate Map' (FIRM)  means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   'Flood Insurance Risk Zones' Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
   base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.

flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   'Flood Insurance Study' means the official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries, and the water
surface elevations of the base flood.
   (p)   'Floodplain Administrator' means that member of the City of Oxford
staff duly designated to administer and implement the provisions of this
chapter.
   (q)    'Flood Protection Elevation'   The Flood Protection Elevation, or
FPE, is the base flood elevation plus two feet of freeboard. In areas where no
base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (r)   'Floodway' means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge height is no more than one foot
at any point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area,
and is usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity
flood waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to
high erosion forces.
   (s)   'Freeboard'  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (t)   'Historic structure'  means any structure that is:
      (1)    Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)    Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)    Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office; or
      (4)    Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places
maintained by the City of Oxford's Historic Architectural Preservation
Commission and historic program which is certified by the Ohio Historic
Preservation Office.
   (u)   'Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis' An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (v)   'Letter of Map Change (LOMC)' A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (w)   'Lowest floor' means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes "enclosure below
the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other
than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided
that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design
requirements specified in this chapter for enclosures below the lowest floor.
Refer also to Section
1153.05(e)(4).
   (x)   'Manufactured home' means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term 'manufactured home' does not include a 'recreation vehicle'. For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (y)   'Manufactured home park' As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (z)   'Manufactured home subdivision' means a parcel (or contiguous parcels)
of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for sale. This
definition shall exclude any manufactured home park as defined in Ohio R.C.
3733.01, for which the Public Health Council has exclusive rule making power.
   (aa)   'National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)'  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (bb)   'New construction'  means structures for which the 'start of
construction' commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Flood
Insurance Rate Map, and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   (cc)   'Person'  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (dd)   'Recreational vehicle' means a vehicle which is
      (1)    Built on a single chassis,
      (2)    400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      (3)    Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and

rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure
before the 'start of construction' of the improvement. This term includes
structures that have incurred 'substantial damage', regardless of the actual
repair work performed. The term does not, however, include:
      (1)    Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions;
      (2)    Any alteration of a 'historic structure', provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
'historic structure'; or
      (3)    Any improvement to a structure that is considered new
construction.
   (mm)   'Variance' means a grant of relief from the standards of this chapter
consistent with the variance conditions herein.

   1153.03  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Lands to Which this Chapter Applies.  This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of Oxford as
identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and Section
1153.03(b), including any additional flood hazard areas annexed by the City of
Oxford that are not identified on the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map.
   (b)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. 
      (1)   The areas of special flood hazard have been identified by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency in scientific and engineering reports
entitled 'Flood Insurance Study for Butler County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas'
effective 12/17/2010.  This study, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps
for Butler County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas effective 12/17/2010 and any
revisions thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of
this chapter.
      (2)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Oxford as required by Section
1153.05(d).
   
   (c)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.   This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions, including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes.
However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed
restriction, subdivision regulation, zoning or building code conflict or
overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (d)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of this
chapter, all provisions shall be:
      (1)    Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)    Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of this chapter may be in conflict with a
state law, such state law shall take precedence over the chapter.
   (e)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.   The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the City of Oxford, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
   (f)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1153.06, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

   (j)    Above Ground Gas or Liquid Storage Tanks.  All above ground gas or
liquid storage tanks shall be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral movement
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads.
   (k)    Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.   The floodway is an extremely hazardous
area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential
projectiles, and erosion potential. The following provisions apply within all
delineated floodway areas:
         A.   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development unless a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis performed by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
         B.   Any development within the floodway that would result in an
increase in base flood elevations can only be granted upon may be permitted
provided all of the following are completed by the applicant;
            i.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1153.04(j)(1);
            ii.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            iii.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            iv.    Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            v.     Concurrence of the City Manager of the City of Oxford and
the Floodplain Administrator of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
            vi.   Approval by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (2)   Development in Special Flood Hazard Areas with Base Flood
Elevations but No Floodways.
         A.    In special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where base
flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated, the
cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance
of a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been meet; or
         B.   Development in special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA
where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            i.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            ii.   Section
1153.04(e) and
1153.05(a) thru (j) as applicable.
      (3)   Standards in special flood hazard areas without base flood
elevation data. 
In all areas of special flood hazard on the Flood Insurance Rate Map where base
flood elevation data is not available from any source, the following provisions
apply:
         A.   New construction and substantial improvement of any residential,
manufactured home, commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure
shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to at least two feet
above the highest adjacent natural grade.
      (4)   Alteration of watercourses.   For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   Notify adjacent communities, the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources, Division of Water, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification must
be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         B.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion
of said watercourse will not be diminished.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of Oxford specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1153.04(j)(1) when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 3128.  Passed 10-19-10.)
   1153.06  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Variance Procedure.  All documentation and procedure as outlined in
accordance with Chapter
1129 and Chapter
1139 of the Oxford Planning & Zoning Code shall be followed in addition to the
requirements herein.
      (1)   Appeal Board.
         A.   The Oxford Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals
and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.
         B.   The Oxford Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals
when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter, and in accordance with Chapter
1129 and Chapter
1139 of the Oxford Planning & Zoning Code.
         C.   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Oxford Board of Zoning
Appeals or any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Butler County Court of
Common Pleas, as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
         D.   In passing upon such application, the Oxford Board of Zoning
Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
            i.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
            ii.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
            iii.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
            iv.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
            v.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
            vi.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
            vii.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
            viii.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area;
            ix.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            x.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
            xi.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         E.   Upon consideration of the factors of subsection D. i-xi. hereof
and the purposes of this chapter, the Oxford Board of Zoning Appeals may attach
such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further
the purposes of this chapter.
         F.   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency upon request.
      (2)   Conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         C.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing the items in subsection D. i-xi. hereof
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         D.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
         E.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            i.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
            ii.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
            iii.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in
subsection D. i-xi hereof, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
            iv.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            v.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         F.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
            (Ord. 3128.  Passed 10-19-10.)

   (s)   Additions, deletions and/or revisions to Chapter 3 of the IPMC are as
follows:
SECTION 310 RENTAL PERMITS
PMC-310.1 Permits required. No person shall operate any residential rental
unit, rooming house, lodging house, multi-family dwelling, dwelling unit or
fraternity/sorority house unless he or she has a valid Residential Rental
Permit issued by the code official in the name of the owner or agent for the
specified residential rental unit, rooming house, lodging house, multi-family
dwelling, dwelling unit, or fraternity/sorority house.  No person shall rent or
lease a dwelling unit, except to a member of his or her family, without a
Residential Rental Permit issued by the code official in the name of the owner
or agent for the specific dwelling unit.
   Exceptions:
   1.   Permits are not required for single-family homes that are subject to a
two- party agreement where no monetary compensation is paid by either party and
the exchange does not exceed two (2) years in duration, whereby owners occupy
each other's single-family home.
   2.   Permits are not required for single-family homes that are permitted by
the City as short-term rental homes for transients.
PMC-310.2 Application process.  The owner or agent shall apply to the code
official for a Residential Rental Permit, certifying that the subject property
is in compliance with Oxford's PMC and submitting the requisite application
form, floor plans, and processing fee, in the event a processing fee is
required.  In addition, each owner or agent of residential rental property
situated in the City is required to provide the code official with a copy of
any Residential Rental Property Registration form(s) submitted by the owner or
owner's agent to the Butler County Auditor's Office in accordance with R.C.
5323.02.
PMC 310.2.1 Floor plan required.  Every person submitting an application for a
new rental property shall provide a floor plan of the property to the code
official, which shall be reviewed for compliance with the Oxford PMC and Zoning
Code.  The floor plan will include all habitable levels as well as stairways,
windows, doors, room dimensions, and bedroom closets (which are not to be
included in room dimensions), and shall include room labels such as kitchen,
dining room, bedroom, etc.  The submitted floor plan will be retained by the
City in the Oxford Community Development Department's rental property file and
shall be reviewed and/or updated upon any change in the property such as a
change of ownership, building addition, or building alteration.
An owner or agent may be required to provide an updated floor plan if the code
official deems the floor plan on file to be insufficient, inadequate, or
outdated.
PMC 310.2.2 Inspections of residential rental property.  At the time of each
application for an initial or renewal of a Residential Rental Permit, and at
any time thereafter when it appears an inspection is warranted, the code
official may request permission of the property owner or the owner's agent to
inspect the dwelling unit for compliance with Oxford's PMC in an effort to help
ensure the safety and welfare of tenants living in its community.  If the owner
or agent grants the code official permission to inspect the premises, the
inspection will be performed by the code official and/or another duly
authorized person conducting inspections for the City, with the owner or
owner's agent present, within thirty (30) days of the owner or agent's granting
of consent.  The owner or agent must cooperate with the code official to ensure
the timely completion of the full inspection.
If the property owner or agent does not consent to the inspection, or if the
owner's agent, occupant, or any other person in charge of the property refuses
to permit free access and entry to the property for the inspection after the
property owner's voluntary consent has been obtained, the code official may
appear before any judge in a court of competent jurisdiction and seek an
administrative search warrant to allow an inspection of the property.  Any
application for an administrative search warrant shall be made within ten (10)
business days after consent and/or entry to the premises has been denied.  The
application for the warrant shall specify the basis upon which the
administrative search warrant is being sought and shall include a statement
that the inspection will be limited to a determination as to whether there are
violations of Oxford's PMC and/or Oxford's Zoning Code.
When determining whether a warrant shall issue, the court may consider the
following:
      1.   Any plain view violations;
      2.   Any eyewitness account of a violation;
      3.   The nature of any alleged violation;
      4.   Records of past violations;
      5.   Violations which are apparent from City records;
      6.   Any citizen complaints concerning the property;
      7.   Any tenant complaints concerning the property;
      8.   The age and condition of the property;
      9.   Any documented violations concerning similar properties in the area;
      10.   The condition of the entire area;
      11.   The number of tenants that may be residing on the property;
      12.   The nature of the rental unit (i.e., one-family, two-family,
lodging house, etc.);
      13.   The passage of time since the last inspection; and
      14.   Any other factor the court deems relevant.
If a warrant is issued, no property owner, occupant, or agent shall fail, upon
presentation of the warrant, to permit entry to the property by the code
official and/or any duly authorized person conducting inspections for the City
for the purpose of an inspection that is consistent with this section and the
warrant obtained.  If the court does not issue a warrant, or if no warrant is
sought, an inspection of the property shall still take place within thirty (30)
days of the owner or agent's refusal to grant consent, or the denial of access
to the property for an inspection if access has been denied, but the scope of
the inspection shall be limited to such areas of the property that are in plain
view.  A plain view inspection shall be considered an "inspection" for the
purposes of this section and any other applicable provisions of Oxford's PMC. 
No criminal penalties or fines shall attach, nor shall any rental permit be
denied, based solely on the owner's, occupant's or agent's refusal to consent
to a full inspection. In the event that only a plain view inspection is
conducted prior to the issuance of a Residential Rental Permit, the permit
shall note that fact on its face, and the plain view inspection shall not
constitute any evidence of PMC compliance with respect to any uninspected
portions of the property. 
Within five (5) business days of conducting a full or plain view inspection,
the code official shall:
      1.   In the event of a full inspection, notify the property owner, or the
owner's duly authorized agent, whether the property is in compliance with
Oxford's PMC and, if it is not, what repairs and/or changes are required to
bring the property into compliance with the coder and the date by which the
repairs and/or changes must be made.
      2.   In the event a plain view inspection, notify the property owner, or
the owner's duly authorized agent, whether the portions of the property that
are in the plain view of the code official appear to be in compliance with
Oxford's PMC and, if the portion of the property that is in the plain view does
not appear to be in compliance with Oxford's PMC, what repairs and/or changes
are required to bring the property into compliance with the code and the date
by which the repairs and/or changes must be made.  In all instances of plain
view inspections, the code official is making no representations as to whether
the inspected property is in full compliance with Oxford's PMC, as that cannot
be adequately determined without the benefit of full inspection.
If, in the event of a full or plain view inspection, an owner and/or his agent
is notified by the code official that repairs and/or changes to the property
are required in order to bring the property into compliance with Oxford's PMC,
the owner and/or his agent shall have ten (10) business days to complete the
requisite repairs or changes and shall immediately notify the code official
upon the completion of the requisite repairs and/or changes.  Within five (5)
business days of the code official's notification that the requisite repairs
and/or changes have been completed, the code official shall re-inspect the
property to determine if the required repairs and/or changes have been
successfully completed. 
PMC-310.3 Permits issued.  A copy of any permit issued pursuant to this section
shall be protected and displayed in a conspicuous place on the premises at all
times and shall state the maximum occupancy permitted on the premises as well
as the name of the owner and the owner's designated agent(s), if any.  Every
person holding a permit pursuant to this section shall return the permit to the
code official within ten (10) days after having given up the control or
operation of the residential rental property or having sold, transferred, given
away, or otherwise disposed of the property.  Every Residential Rental Permit
issued for any rooming house, lodging house, multi-family dwelling, dwelling
unit, or fraternity/sorority house shall expire at the end of one (1) year
following the effective date of the issuance of the permit, unless sooner
revoked pursuant to PMC Section 310.4, or by operation of PMC Section 110.  A
Residential Rental Permit may not be issued to another owner or agent without a
full or plain view re-inspection of the premises by the code official. 
PMC-310.4 Agent required.  Every owner of a dwelling not residing on the
premises shall appoint and designate an agent to act on owner's behalf and
shall notify the code official with the telephone number of the appointed agent
and the notification shall contain an acceptance of such appointment signed by
the designated agent.  An individual may act as his or her own agent so long as
he or she is a resident of Butler County or one of its surrounding counties. 
The agent required by this section must be a permanent resident of Butler
County, Ohio, or an adjoining county, or an entity operating a permanent office
in Butler County, Ohio, or an adjoining county.  Adjoining counties are
Hamilton, Montgomery, Preble, and Warren in Ohio, and Dearborn, Franklin, and
Union in Indiana.
PMC-310.4.1 Agent defined.  An "agent" is defined as a responsible person or
entity who, except in the case of the property owner, has been retained by and
acts for, or in place of, the owner of a property with the responsibility of
providing a healthy and safe environment for inhabitants by complying with all
applicable rules and regulations and who has been granted authority by the
owner to consent to inspections.
PMC-310.5 Revocation of rental permits. Whenever, upon inspection of any
premises requiring a Residential Rental Permit, the code official finds that
conditions or practices exist which are in violation of any provision of the
Oxford PMC, the code official shall give notice in accordance with PMC Section
107 to the owner or owner's agents of the property.  At the end of the time
period specified in the notice, the code official shall re-inspect the premises
and if the code official finds that such conditions or practices have not been
corrected and if no appeal has been filed in accordance with Section 111 of the
PMC, the code official shall give notice in writing to the owner or owner's
agent that the permit has been revoked.  Upon receipt of such notice, the owner
or the owner's agent shall immediately take any and all action necessary to
cease operation of such rental unit or rental units and shall thereafter not
permit any tenant to live, sleep, or reside in the property until another
Residential Rental Permit is obtained.
PMC-310.6 Appeal of permit revocation.  Any person who has received notice that
his or her permit is being revoked unless existing conditions or practices at
the rental premises are corrected may, within twenty (20) days after the date
of such notice, file an appeal and shall be granted a hearing upon the matter
pursuant to PMC Section 111 ("Means of Appeal").

less than eight feet high for protection and to prevent entry of unauthorized
persons. When located less than five feet from the street, a fence or other
barrier shall be erected when required by the Building Administrator, or
designee. This requirement may be waived where the City Manager and Building

walkway for pedestrians, not less than eight feet high and four feet wide. Each
side of the walk shall be provided with smooth handrails.

a covered walk is not necessary, a permit may be issued to block-off part of
the sidewalk and construct a temporary walk, but without cover.
         (Ord. 2798.  Passed 10-7-03.)
   1307.06  PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Utility Connections. All service utility connections shall be
discontinued and capped in accordance with approved rules and practices of each

material, such as beams and columns, shall be lowered and not allowed to fall.
   (c)   Sprinkling. Chutes, floors, stairways and other places affected shall
be sprinkled sufficiently to control the impact of dust on the neighboring
properties.

construction has not commenced within thirty days following demolition, the
vacant lot shall be filled with clean fill, graded and maintained in conformity
to the established street grade at curb level or natural grade. The lot shall

Resources, Division of Water, prior to any alteration or relocation of a
watercourse and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
         B.   Require that necessary maintenance will be provided for by the
applicant, his successors or assigns for the altered or relocated portion of
said watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished.
      (6)   The Zoning Administrator shall: Make interpretations where needed
as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood
hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped
boundary and actual field conditions). Any affected person contesting the
location of the boundary may appeal the interpretation pursuant to Chapter
1127.
