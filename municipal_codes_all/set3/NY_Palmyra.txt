§ 84-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Curfew Law of the Village of Palmyra."
§ 84-2. Policy; purpose; findings.
A. Policy. It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Village of Palmyra
(the "Village") to minimize nocturnal crime, juvenile delinquency and
vandalism and to prevent the damage and destruction of both public
and private property.
B. Purpose. It is the purpose of the Village to promote the health, safety
and general welfare of the residents of the Town/Village and to maintain
rule and order by prescribing, in accordance with prevailing community
standards, regulations concerning the presence of minors on streets,
roads, highways, public parks or other public areas of the Village at
night, to reduce juvenile crime and vandalism to protect the children
and minors of the Village and to further family responsibility.
C. Findings. The Board of Trustees of the Village hereby finds that:
(1) There has been a significant breakdown in the supervision normally
provided by certain parents and guidance for minors resulting in
minors being involved in a wide range of unacceptable conduct,
including vandalism, noisy, rowdy and disturbing behavior,
breaking and entering, public drinking, littering and harassment of
Village residents.
(2) Significant numbers of minors have been congregating in the
Village after dark causing disturbances of residents.
(3) Offensive activities of minors are not easily controlled by existing
laws.
(4) The sense of the community is that there is a proper time for the
cessation of outdoor activities of minors.
§ 80-8 PALMYRA CODE § 84-2
80:48
§ 84-3. Definitions; word usage.
(5) There is a need for a curfew for minors to achieve, under local
conditions, the policy and purposes herein stated.
(6) Curfew regulations will meet special needs, will enable the
community to better control streets and public places, will be a
significant factor in minimizing juvenile delinquency and will
enable the police to act reasonably and fairly to prevent the
violation of the laws by minors.
(7) The curfew hours declared by this chapter take into consideration
the danger hours for nocturnal crime and for accumulations of
minors with the potential risks incident to immaturity.
(8) Curfew regulations in other communities have been a significant
factor in reducing juvenile delinquency.
(9) Parental responsibility for the whereabouts and conduct of minors
should be the norm; as parental control increases, the likelihood of
juvenile delinquency decreases.
A. As used in this chapter, the following terms, phrases, words and their
derivations shall have the meanings indicated:
KNOWINGLY  Includes knowledge of information which a parent
should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts
of a minor in that parent's legal custody. It is intended to include
and require neglectful or careless parents to maintain a reasonable
community standard of parental responsibility through an objective
test. It shall be no defense that a parent was indifferent to the activities,
conduct or whereabouts of such minor.
MINOR  Any person under the age of 18 years of age or, in equivalent
phrasing sometimes employed herein, any person 17 or less years of
age.
PARENT  Any person having legal custody of a minor as a natural or
adoptive parent, as a legal guardian, as a person who stands in loco
parentis or as a person to whom legal custody has been given by court
order.
PUBLIC PLACE  Any place to which the public has access, whether
privately or publically owned, including but not limited to public
streets, roads, thoroughfares, sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks,
recreation or shopping areas, stores, cafes, restaurants, eating
establishments, public transportation facilities, vehicles used for public
transportation, parking lots or any other public building, structure or
area.
REMAIN or LOITER  To stay behind, to tarry or to stay in or upon a
public place.
§ 84-2 BUILDINGS, UNSAFE § 84-3
80:49
§ 84-4. Curfew established for minors.
It shall be unlawful and a violation of this chapter for a minor to be or
loiter or remain in, on or upon a public place within the Village between the
following hours (the "curfew hours"):
§ 84-5. Exceptions and exemptions.
A minor in a public place during the curfew hours shall not be considered in
violation of this chapter under the following circumstances:
TIME OF NIGHT  Based upon the prevailing standard of time,
whether Eastern standard time or Eastern daylight saving time,
generally observed at the hour by the public in the Village.
YEARS OF AGE  Years of age continues from one birthday to, but
not including, the day of the next so that 17 or less years of age is
equivalent to under 18 years of age.

freedom of speech and the right to such exercise, provided that the
minor has in his possession a writing, signed by the minor and by a
parent of the minor, with their home address and telephone number,
specifying when, where and in what manner the minor will be in a
public place during curfew hours in the exercise of a First Amendment
right specified in such writing.

K. When the minor is authorized by a special permit from the Village
Board carried on the person of the minor thus authorized, as follows:
When necessary nighttime activities of a minor are inadequately
provided for by the provisions of this chapter, recourse may be had to
the Village Board for a special permit as circumstances warrant. Upon
the Village Board's findings of necessity for the use of a public place or
places, and with written parental consent, the Village Board may grant
a special permit, in writing, for use by such minor of a specified public
place or places, for specified periods of time as in the Village Board's
judgment may be necessary. Such special permit may be revoked by the
Village Board for good cause shown following a hearing.
A. If a police officer reasonably believes that a person is in a public place
in violation of this chapter, the officer shall notify the person of such
violation and shall require the person to provide his or her name,
address, telephone number and how to contact his or her parents. In
determining the age of the person, and in the absence of convincing

§ 108-1. Findings.
The Board of Trustees of the Village Palmyra finds that the potential and/
or actual damages from flooding and erosion may be a problem to the
residents of the Village of Palmyra and that such damages may include
destruction or loss of private and public housing; damage to public facilities,
both publicly and privately owned; and injury to and loss of human life. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
and objectives hereinafter set forth, this chapter is adopted.
§ 108-2. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
§ 108-3. Objectives.
The objectives of this chapter are:
A. Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due
to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
D. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damages;
E. Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert
floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and
F. Qualify for and maintain participation in the National Flood Insurance
Program.
A. To protect human life and health;
B. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
C. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
§ 108-1 PALMYRA CODE § 108-3
108:60
§ 108-4. Definitions and word usage.
F. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;
G. To provide that developers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
H. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
A. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
B. As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:

§ 108-13. Duties and responsibilities of local administrator.
Duties of the local administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the
following:
A. Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the
following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(1) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 108-12, Application for permit, and for
compliance with the provisions and standards of this chapter.
(2) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks, to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard,
all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
applicable standards of §§ 108-14 through 108-18 and, in
particular, § 108-14A, Subdivision proposals.
(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special
flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property
(e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood velocities). The local
administrator may require the applicant to submit additional
technical analyses and data necessary to complete the
determination. If the proposed development may result in physical
damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
§§ 108-14 through 108-18, no permit shall be issued. The applicant
may revise the application to include measures that mitigate or
eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit the application.
(4) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
state or federal law.
B. Use of other flood data.
(1) When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has designated
areas of special flood hazard on the communitys Flood Insurance
Rate map (FIRM) but has neither produced water surface elevation
data (these areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM) nor
identified a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 108-12H, as criteria for requiring that new
construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meet the requirements of this chapter.
(2) When base flood elevation data are not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood

within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
D. Construction stage.
(1) In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor or
completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially improved
structure, obtain from the permit holder a certification of the asbuilt
elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation, in
relation to mean sea level. The certificate shall be prepared by or
under the direct supervision of a licensed land surveyor or
professional engineer and certified by same. For manufactured
homes, the permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation
upon placement of the structure on the site. A certificate of
elevation must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it
remains on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is
fully licensed and ready for highway use).
(2) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval of
the certification shall be at the permit holders risk. The local
administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies detected
shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project unless
immediately corrected.
E. Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developers engineer or
architect shall make periodic inspections at appropriate times
throughout the period of construction in order to monitor compliance
with permit conditions and enable said inspector to certify, if requested,
that the development is in compliance with the requirements of the
floodplain development permit and/or any variance provisions.

size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, providing § 108-19D(1) through
(12) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
(1) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structures continued designation as a historic structure.
(2) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D, E, and F of this section are met;
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.
D. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any

or property within an historic district, nor shall any person make any
material change in the appearance of such property, its light fixtures,
signs, sidewalks, fences, steps, paving or other exterior elements which
affect the appearance and cohesiveness of the landmark or historic district,
without first obtaining a certificate of appropriateness from the Historic
Preservation Commission.
§ 116-5. Criteria for approval of a certificate of appropriateness.
§ 116-6. Application procedure for certificate of appropriateness.
A. In passing upon an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the
Historic Preservation Commission shall not consider changes to interior
spaces, unless they are open to the public. The Commission's decision
shall be based on the following principles:
(1) Properties which contribute to the character of the historic district
shall be retained, with their historic features altered as little as
possible;
(2) Any alteration of existing properties shall be compatible with their
historic character, as well as with the surrounding district; and
(3) New construction shall be compatible with the district in which it is
located.
B. In applying the principle of compatibility, the Commission shall
consider the following factors:
(1) The general design, character and appropriateness to the property
of the proposed alteration or new construction;
(2) The scale of proposed alteration or new construction in relation to
the property itself, surrounding properties, and the neighborhood;
(3) Texture, materials, and color and their relation to similar features
of other properties in the neighborhood;
(4) Visual compatibility with surrounding properties, including
proportion of the property's front facade, proportion and
arrangement of windows and other openings within the facade,
roof shape, and the rhythm of spacing of properties on streets,
including setback; and
(5) The importance of historic, architectural or other features to the
significance of the property.
A. Prior to the commencement of any work requiring a certificate of
appropriateness, the owner shall file an application for such a
certificate with the Historic Preservation Commission. The application
shall contain:
(1) Name, address and telephone number of applicant;
§ 116-4 GAMES OF CHANCE § 116-6
113:85
§ 116-7. Hardship criteria for demolition.
An applicant whose certificate of appropriateness for a proposed demolition
has been denied may apply to the Commission for relief on the ground of
(2) Location and photographs of property;
(3) Elevation drawings of proposed changes;
(4) Perspective drawings, including relationship to adjacent
properties;
(5) Samples of color or materials to be used;
(6) Where the proposal includes signs or lettering, a scale drawing
showing the type of lettering to be used, all dimensions and colors,
a description of materials to be used, method of illumination, and a
plan showing the sign's location on the property; and
(7) Any other information which the Commission may deem necessary
in order to visualize the proposed work.
B. No building permit shall be issued for such proposed work until a
certificate of appropriateness has first been issued by the Historic
Preservation Commission. The certificate of appropriateness required
by this chapter shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any building
permit that may be required by any other ordinance of the Village of
Palmyra. Before acting on or forwarding to the appropriate board any
application for a variance, special use permit, site plan, building permit,
demolition permit, sign permit or subdivision, the Code Enforcement
Officer shall first consult a current list of all properties designated as
individual landmarks or as contained within historic districts to
determine the requesting property's status.
C. The Commission shall hold a public hearing on the application, at which
an opportunity will be provided for proponents and opponents of the
application to present their views. The Commission shall approve, deny
or approve the permit with modifications within 62 business days
following the public hearing.
D. All decisions of the Commission shall be in writing. A copy shall be sent
to the applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested, and a copy
filed with the Village Clerk's office for public inspection. The
Commission's decision shall state the reasons for denying or modifying
any application. The original documents will be housed in the Town of
Palmyra Code Enforcement Office. Official copies will also be held in the
Palmyra Village Office.
E. Certificates of appropriateness shall be valid for six months, after which
the owner must reapply if he or she still wishes to start work on the
property. The work must be completed in 12 months.

hardship. In order to prove the existence of hardship, the applicant shall
establish that:
§ 116-8. Hardship criteria for alteration.
An applicant whose certificate of appropriateness for a proposed alteration
has been denied may apply for relief on the ground of hardship. In order
to prove the existence of hardship, the applicant shall establish that the
property is incapable of earning a reasonable return, regardless of whether
that return represents the most profitable return possible.
§ 116-9. Application procedure for hardship.
A. The applicant cannot afford to maintain or rehabilitate the property,
i.e.:
(1) In the case of a single-family or two-family owner-occupied house,
an inability to preserve the structure without financial hardship; or
(2) In the case of a rental or commercial property, an inability to earn a
reasonable return on property if the structure is preserved; or
(3) In the case of a property owned and used by a nonprofit
organization, an inability to preserve the structure without
financial hardship interfering with the applicant's charitable
purpose;
B. The property cannot be renovated or adapted by the owner, or by a
purchaser, for any use that would result in a reasonable return;
C. The owner has sought financial assistance under established programs
for historic preservation and has failed to obtain sufficient assistance to
enable him or her economically to preserve the structure;
D. Reasonable efforts to find a purchaser interested in acquiring the
property and preserving it have failed;
E. Reasonable efforts to consider relocation of the landmark have been
undertaken and determined to be not feasible economically; and
F. The hardship is the result of the application of this chapter and is not
the result of any act or omission by the applicant.
A. After receiving written notification from the Commission of the denial of
a certificate of appropriateness, an applicant may commence the
hardship process. No building permit or demolition permit shall be
issued unless the Commission makes a finding that a hardship exists.
B. The Commission shall hold a public hearing on the hardship application
at which an opportunity will be provided for proponents and opponents
of the application to present their views.
§ 116-7 GAMES OF CHANCE § 116-9
113:87
§ 116-10. Enforcement.
All work performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness issued
under this chapter shall conform to any requirements included therein.
It shall be the duty of the Building Code Enforcement Officer to inspect
periodically any such work to assure compliance. In the event work is
found that is not being performed in accordance with the certificate of
appropriateness, or upon notification of such fact by the Historic
Preservation Commission, the Building Code Enforcement Officer shall
issue a stop-work order, and all work shall immediately cease. No further
work shall be undertaken on the project as long as a stop-work order is in
effect.
§ 116-11. Maintenance and repair required.
C. The applicant shall consult in good faith with the Commission, local
preservation groups and interested parties in a diligent effort to seek an
alternative that will result in preservation of the property.
D. All decisions of the Commission shall be in writing. A copy shall be sent
to the applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested, and a copy
filed with the Village Clerk's office for public inspection. The
Commission's decision shall state the reasons for granting or denying
the hardship application. If the application is granted, the Commission
shall approve only such work as is necessary to alleviate the hardship.
A. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance and repair of any exterior architectural feature of a
landmark or property within an historic district which does not involve
a change in design, material, color or outward appearance.
B. No owner or person with an interest in real property designated as a
landmark or included within an historic district shall permit the
property to fall into a serious state of disrepair so as to result in the
deterioration of any exterior architectural feature which would, in the
judgment of the Historic Preservation Commission, produce a
detrimental effect upon the character of the historic district as a whole
or the life and character of the property itself.
C. Examples of such deterioration include:
(1) Deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical support;
(2) Deterioration of roofs or other horizontal members;
(3) Deterioration of exterior chimneys;
(4) Deterioration or crumbling of exterior stucco or mortar;
(5) Ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs or foundations,
including broken windows or doors;

113:88
§ 116-12. Violations; penalties for offenses.
§ 116-13. Appeals.
Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Historic Preservation Commission
relating to hardship or a certificate of appropriateness may, within 15 days
of the decision, file a written application with the Palmyra Village Board
for review of the decision. Reviews shall be conducted based on the same

§ 130-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Nuisance Abatement Law of the Village
of Palmyra."
§ 130-2. Findings; purpose.
The Board of Trustees finds that public nuisances exist in the Village of
Palmyra in the operation of certain establishments and the use of property,
including residential premises, in violation of the Penal Law of the State
of New York, the New York State Uniform Fire Prevention and Building
Code and the Code of the Village of Palmyra, which nuisances substantially
and seriously interfere with the interest of the public in the quality of life
and total community environment, commerce in the Village, property values
and the public health, safety, peace, comfort, conveniences or welfare.
The Board of Trustees further finds that the continued occurrence of such
activities and violations is detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of
the people of the Village of Palmyra and the businesses thereof and the
visitors thereto. It is the purpose of this chapter to authorize the Village
to impose sanctions and penalties for such public nuisances and remediate
the same, and such powers may be exercised either in conjunction with,
or apart from the powers contained in other laws without prejudice to the
use of procedures and remedies available under other such laws. The Board
of Trustees further finds that the sanctions and penalties and remedial
measures authorized herein constitute an additional and appropriate
method of law enforcement in response to the proliferation of public
nuisances. The sanctions, penalties and remedial measures are reasonable
and necessary in order to protect the health and safety of the people of the
Village and to promote the general welfare.

Parks and recreation areas  See Ch. 132.
§ 149-1. Legislative authority.
This chapter is adopted pursuant to the Municipal Home Rule Law, which
enables local governments to adopt local laws relating to their property,
affairs, or government, so long as the local laws are not inconsistent with
the New York State Constitution or any general law of New York State.
The New York State Municipal Home Rule Law also authorizes local
governments to adopt local laws regulating the protection, order, conduct,
safety, health and welfare of the persons within the local municipality.
§ 149-2. Purpose.
A. The purpose of this chapter is to promote the health, safety, and welfare
of the community (including the preservation and protection of the
persons, property, minors, and children of the Village of Palmyra) and to
protect peace and good order in the Village, by regulating and
controlling residency, presence, and activities of certain sex offenders
in the Village of Palmyra and by providing enforcement in furtherance
thereof.
B. The State of New York and the Federal Government regulate certain
activities of sex offenders, but such regulations do not preclude further
legislation by municipalities. Thus, the Village of Palmyra is seeking to
further define local laws in relationship to individuals who have been
categorized as Level Two sex offenders and Level Three sex offenders.
Level Two and Level Three registered sex offenders, some of whom
have committed criminal sexual offenses against minors, reside in the
Village. Under the Corrections Law, Level Two sex offenders have been
determined to pose a moderate risk of repeat offense and Level Three
sex offenders have been determined to pose a high risk of repeat
offense. In order to protect the minor inhabitants of the Village from
such sex offenders, and the peace and good order therein, the Village
Board of the Village of Palmyra finds and determines that it is
necessary, and in the best interest of the residents of the Village of
Palmyra, to establish residency, proximity and activity restrictions for
all Level Two and Level Three registered sex offenders who reside in
the Village of Palmyra or who are otherwise actually present in the
Village of Palmyra at any time.

this chapter tertiary, but only to the extent this chapter is impermissibly
inconsistent with such federal or state laws. Unless expressly preempted,
any provisions of this chapter that are more restrictive or stringent than
any applicable federal or state law shall be and remain enforceable until
and unless declared unenforceable, unconstitutional, or impermissible by a
court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction.

No. 1-2004]
A. The purposes of this article are set forth in general terms in enabling
legislation contained in the Village Law. The provisions of this article
shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the protection of the
health, safety and welfare of the people at large, and are designed to
encourage the establishment of reasonable standards for the physical
environment.
B. It is fundamental for the purpose of this article to recognize that
sidewalks have been constructed in the Village for the safe use of the
public at large and for the convenience of property owners and their
guests, and that the public at large has the right to expect reasonable
standards of maintenance and freedom of access to such sidewalks.
C. This section, together with all provisions of the article, shall be
considered when appraising the spirit of this article as a guide to its
interpretation.
A. Where a sidewalk does not exist, the owner of property abutting the
Village right-of-way may request construction of a sidewalk by the
Village. The Village Board shall determine whether the Village shall
construct such sidewalk in the interest of public safety and welfare.

B. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent or in any way limit
the right of the Village to construct a sidewalk of its own volition within
the Village right-of-way.
A. It shall be the responsibility of the Village to repair or replace any
hazardous sections of the sidewalk, and the cost of such replacement
shall be borne in its entirety by the Village unless the hazardous
sidewalk was made hazardous by the acts or negligence of the adjoining
property owner, in which case the adjoining property owner shall be
responsible for the cost of repair or replacement.
B. Where a homeowner removes any or all of his/her sidewalk, for any
reason, he/she is responsible to have that sidewalk replaced within a
reasonable time or within 60 days (weather permitting). After the
sidewalk is removed, the area, however, must be accessible to Village
sidewalk equipment.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section shall be to preserve the public
peace and good order in the Village and to contribute to the public
welfare, safety and good order of its people and to contribute to the safe

establishing certain regulations for the removal of snow and ice from
the streets and sidewalks of the Village that are consistent with the
rights and privileges of other residents of the Village.
B. Duty of the property owner and occupant. It shall be the duty of the
owner and occupant, jointly, of every parcel of real estate adjoining a
public sidewalk, whether the parcel of real estate is occupied by a
structure or not, to keep such sidewalks adjoining such property free
from snow and ice for the full paved width of such sidewalk.
§ 163-4 PALMYRA CODE § 163-6
159:166
C. Time limit. Snow and ice shall be removed within 24 hours after the end
of a snowfall. In addition, sidewalks in front of commercial
establishments and commercial parking lots shall be kept free of snow
and ice at all times between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.
D. Severe icing. In case snow and ice on any sidewalk shall be frozen so
hard that it cannot be removed without injury to the sidewalk, it shall,
within the time specified in Subsection C, be strewn and kept strewn
with ashes, sand, or other suitable material, so as to be no longer
dangerous to life and limb. As soon as practical thereafter, the sidewalk
shall be completely cleared of snow, ice and other materials strewn
thereon, as provided in this section.
E. Complaints concerning a violation of this chapter shall be made in
writing, sworn to by the complainant and filed with the Village Clerk,
who in turn shall cause a notice to be provided as set forth in
Subsection F herein.
F. The owner, occupant or any person having control over any lot, land or
property found in violation of this section shall be notified, in writing,
only once in any given year for a particular violation. Subsequent
violations of a similar nature at the same location during the same year
shall be corrected by the Village or its agent without notice to the
owner, occupant or person having control of said property. After initial
notification, such owner, occupant or person having control of said
property will be presumed to have been given sufficient notice of
infraction for the entire season. Such notice shall set forth the nature of
the complaint and shall direct the owner or occupant to remove the
snow and ice from the public sidewalk. The notice required under this
section shall be served upon the owner or his or her executor, legal
representative, agent, lessee or any other person having a vested or
contingent interest in such premises as shown by the records of the
Town Assessor or of the Wayne County Clerk. Service shall be made

thereon and shall be added to the next real property tax levied against
the property by the Village and collected as provided by law.
You will be notified in writing only once in any given year for a
particular violation. Subsequent violations of a similar nature at the
same location during the same year shall be corrected by the Village

control of said property. After initial notification, such owner, occupant
or person having control of said property will be presumed to have
been given sufficient notice of infraction for the entire season.

§ 167-3. Subdivision procedures. [Amended 8-1-2016 by L.L. No.
1-2016]
Whenever any subdivision of land is proposed to be made within the Village
and before any contract for the sale of, or any offer to sell, such subdivision,
or any part thereof, is made, and before any building permit shall be
granted, the procedure outlined below will be observed:
Arterial streets and highways are those used primarily for fast or heavy
traffic.
A.
Collector streets are those which carry traffic from minor streets to
the major system of arterial streets and highways. Collectors may also
serve as secondary arteries to carry some through traffic.
B.
Local streets are those which are used primarily for access to the
abutting properties.
C.
Marginal access streets are minor streets which are parallel to and
adjacent to arterial streets and highways and which provide access to
abutting properties and protection front through traffic.
D.
53.Editor's Note: See now Village Law § 7-724.
§ 167-2 SPITTING § 167-3
159:171
A. The owner shall apply, in writing, to the Zoning Board of Appeals/
Planning Board for approval of such subdivision.
B. Previous to the filing of the preliminary plan, the owner may submit
general site information, a location map and a sketch plan with a
request for informal consideration and advice. This step does not
require formal application, fee or the filing of a plat.
C. The owner shall submit to the Zoning Board of Appeals/Planning Board
two copies of a preliminary plan with other supplementary material as
described in § 167-6 of this chapter and subsequently a final subdivision
plat as hereinafter specified.
D. The Zoning Board of Appeals/Planning Board will discuss the
preliminary plan with the owner at a regular meeting of the Zoning
Board of Appeals/Planning Board.
E. Approval; disapproval.
(1) The Zoning Board of Appeals/Planning Board shall communicate to
the owner, in writing, within 30 days of the regular meeting, its
decision concerning the preliminary plan. If the preliminary plan is
approved, the Zoning Board of Appeals/Planning Board shall
express its approval as "conditional approval" and state any
specific changes it will require in the preliminary plan. For any
subdivision or portion of subdivision, the Zoning Board of Appeals/
Planning Board will state, in writing, the character and extent of
the required public improvements for which waivers may have
been requested which, in the opinion of the Zoning Board of
Appeals/Planning Board, may be waived without jeopardy to public
health, safety, morals, and general welfare or which are
inappropriate because of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities
adjacent to or in proximity to the proposed subdivision.
(2) If the preliminary plan is disapproved, the Zoning Board of
Appeals/Planning Board shall state the reasons for its disapproval.
The action of the Zoning Board of Appeals/Planning Board shall be
noted on two copies of the preliminary plan, to which shall be
attached referenced statements of any conditions and
requirements determined by the Zoning Board of Appeals/Planning
Board in accordance with this chapter. One copy shall be returned
to the owner and the other retained by the Zoning Board of
Appeals/Planning Board. "Conditional approval" of a preliminary
plan shall not constitute approval of the final subdivision plat.
F. Within six months after receipt of the conditional approval of the
Zoning Board of Appeals/Planning Board with respect to the
preliminary plan, the owner shall file with the Zoning Board of Appeals/
Planning Board two copies drawn in ink on tracing cloth, or black line
prints on tracing cloth, of the final subdivision plat together with other
supplementary material as described in § 167-7 of this chapter. In the
event that a final subdivision plat is not submitted within six months,
§ 167-3 PALMYRA CODE § 167-3
159:172
the application shall be considered withdrawn and any preliminary
approval or waivers of required improvements by the Zoning Board of
Appeals/Planning Board shall be considered lapsed unless an extension
of time is applied for and granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals/
Planning Board.
G. Application for approval of the final subdivision plat shall be submitted,
in writing, to the Zoning Board of Appeals/Planning Board at least 10
days prior to a regular meeting of Zoning Board of Appeals/Planning
Board.
H. The final subdivision plat shall conform to the approved preliminary
plan and shall contain the changes specified by the Zoning Board of
Appeals/Planning Board. If desired by the owner, it may constitute only
that portion of the approved preliminary plan which he proposes to
record and develop at that time, provided that such portion conforms to
all requirements of this chapter.
I. The owner shall, at the time of filing the final subdivision plat with the
Zoning Board of Appeals/Planning Board:
(1) Present a certificate as to adequacy of proposed water supply and
sewerage service as required by the Public Health Law of the State
of New York.
(2) File with the Zoning Board of Appeals/Planning Board a
performance bond, bearing the approval of an attorney acting for
the Village as to form, sufficiency and manner of execution, for the
completion of all the improvements required by § 179-l of the
Village Law54 and not specifically waived by the Zoning Board of
Appeals/Planning Board.
(3) Tender offers of cession, in a form certified as satisfactory by an
attorney acting for the Village, of all land included in streets,
highways, walks or parks and all sewers, drains and water lines not
specifically reserved by the owner. Approval of the final subdivision
plat by the Zoning Board of Appeals/Planning Board, however, shall
not constitute acceptance of offers of cession by the Village.
J. The Zoning Board of Appeals/Planning Board shall hold a public hearing
on the proposed subdivision. Notice of such hearing shall be advertised
in a newspaper of general circulation in the Village, and posted in the
Village Hall, at least five days before such hearing, and all advertising
expenses shall be borne by the subdivider.
K. Within 45 days from the date of the filing of the subdivision plat, the
Zoning Board of Appeals/Planning Board shall approve, modify and
approve, or disapprove the plat.

The owner shall observe the following general requirements and principles
of land subdivision:
L. If the final subdivision plat is approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals/
Planning Board, an appropriate notation to that effect will be made on
the face of original drawing or prints on tracing cloth submitted to the
Zoning Board of Appeals/Planning Board. One copy will be returned to
the owner, and one copy will be retained by the Planning Board for its
records.
M. The owner shall file the approved final subdivision plat with the County
Clerk within 90 days after approval by the Zoning Board of Appeals/
Planning Board. If the final subdivision plat is not filed within this time,
the approval shall expire, as provided in § 179-k of the Village Law.55
A. Streets.
(1) The arrangement, character, extent, width and location of all
streets shall conform to the Master Plan, if any, and to the Official
Map, if any, and shall be considered in their relation to other
existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public
convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the
proposed uses of land to be served and/or abutted by such streets.
(2) Where such is not shown in the Master Plan, the arrangement of
streets in a subdivision shall either:
(a) Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of
existing principal streets in surrounding areas; or
(b) Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted
by the Zoning Board of Appeals/Planning Board to meet a
particular situation where topographical or other conditions
make continuance or conformance to existing streets
impracticable or undesirable.
(3) Local streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic
will be discouraged.
(4) Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
arterial street, the Zoning Board of Appeals/Planning Board may
require marginal access streets, reverse frontage with screen
planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear
property line, or such other treatment as may be necessary for
adequate protection of residential properties and afford separation
of through and local traffic.

(5) Where a subdivision abuts or contains a waterway, a railroad rightof-
way or a controlled access highway right-of-way, the Zoning
Board of Appeals/Planning Board may require a street
approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a
distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as
for park purposes in residential districts or for commercial or
industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances shall
also be determined with due regard for the requirements of
approach grades amid future grade separations.
(6) Reserve strips controlling access to streets, water plants, or to
other land dedicated or to be dedicated to public use shall be
prohibited, except where their control is definitely placed in the
Village under conditions approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals/
Planning Board.
(7) Street jogs with center-line offsets of less than 125 feet shall be
avoided.

of at least 100 feet in length on local and collector streets and of
such lengths as may be deemed necessary by the Zoning Board of
Appeals/Planning Board for arterial streets.
(9) When continuing street lines of a collector street deflect from each
other at any one point by more than 10°, they shall be connected by
a curve with a radius at the inner street right-of-way line of not less
than 350 feet; where continuing street lines of an arterial street
deflect from each other by more than 5°, they shall be connected by
a curve of not less than 800 feet in radius.
(10) Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles, and in no case shall any angle of intersection be less
than 75°. Any change in street alignment to meet this requirement
shall occur at least 100 feet from the intersection.
(11) Street right-of-way lines at street intersections shall be rounded
with a radius of 10 feet or with a greater radius where the Zoning
Board of Appeals/Planning Board may deem it necessary. The
Zoning Board of Appeals/Planning Board may permit comparable

changes of grade:
Street Type
Maximum Grade
(percent)
Arterial 4%
Collector 6%
Local and marginal access 7%
(17) Grades at street intersections shall be held to a maximum of 3% for
a distance of 100 feet in any direction from the point of intersection
of the street center lines.
(18) Street grades shall not be less than 5/10 per 0.3% if there are
street curbs and/or gutters or if pavement wearing surface is
smooth-finished, but only with the approval of the Engineer.
Drainage structures and adequate ditches shall be provided by the
subdivider to prevent ponding or damage to public or private
property.
(19) Limitation of access to streets shall be as follows:
(a) Local streets: no limitation.
(b) Collector streets: no limitation.

provided for utilities where necessary and shall be of not less than
20 feet in width.
(2) Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement
or drainage right-of-way of not less than 20 feet in width
conforming substantially with the lines of such watercourse, and
such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for
the purpose. Parallel streets or parkways may be required in
connection therewith.
C. Blocks.
(1) The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with
due regard to:
(a) Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special
needs of the type of use contemplated.
(b) Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions.
(c) Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of
street traffic.
(d) Limitations and opportunities of topography.
(2) Block length generally shall not exceed 1,600 feet, nor shall it be
less than 600 feet.

preferably spaced at least 1,000 feet apart.
(4) Pedestrian walk rights-of-way not less than 10 feet in width,
property line to property line, shall be required where deemed
essential to provide circulation, or access to schools, playgrounds,
shopping centers, transportation and other community facilities.
D. Lots.
(1) The size, width, depth, shape, orientation and yards of lots shall be
not less than specified in Chapter 200, Zoning, for the district in
which the lots are located and shall be appropriate for the type of
development and use contemplated.
(2) Land subject to flooding shall not be platted for residential
occupancy nor for such other uses as may increase danger to life or
property or aggravate the flood hazard.
(3) Residential lots, where not served by public sewer, shall be such as

all amendments thereto.
§ 167-4 SPITTING § 167-4
159:177
(4) Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width to permit
appropriate building setback from and orientation to both streets.
(5) The subdividing of the land shall be such as to provide, by means of
a public street, each lot with satisfactory access to an existing
public street or highway.
(6) Double frontage and reverse frontage lots should be avoided except
where essential to provide separation of residential development
from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of
topography and orientation. A planting screen easement at least 10
feet wide, across which there shall be no right of access, shall be
provided along the line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other
disadvantageous use.
(7) Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to street
right-of-way lines.
(8) In case a tract is subdivided into larger parcels than normal
building lots, such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow the
opening of future streets and logical further resubdivision.
(9) In case only a portion of a tract is subdivided, or when the plan
submitted covers only a portion of the owner's entire holding, a
sketch of the prospective future street system of the entire holding
shall be submitted to the Zoning Board of Appeals/Planning Board.
E. Public sites and open places.
(1) The subdivision shall dedicate to the Village "usable land" equal in
size to 5% of the subdivider's tract. This land shall be used by the
Village for parks, playgrounds, or for other specific public
recreational uses as deemed desirable by the Village Board.
However, if the Village Board should consider a subdivider's tract
too small and that the dedication of 5% of the total area is not of a
size that would make it usable for a public purpose, the Village
Board shall direct the subdivider to make a money payment to the
Village in lieu of land. This money payment must be equal to 5% of
the market value of the total tract and cannot be used by the Village
for any purpose other than the purchase of land to be used for such
public uses as indicated above.
(2) Unusable areas or areas bordering streams, lakes or other courses
should be given special consideration by the Zoning Board of
Appeals/Planning Board in excess of the five-percent minimum. The
Zoning Board of Appeals/Planning Board may recommend that the
Village Board accept these areas as a gift, or purchase them,
should they be desirable for public open spaces.
(3) Where such sites and open spaces are not shown on the Master
Plan and where deemed essential by the Zoning Board of Appeals/
Planning Board upon consideration of the particular type of
§ 167-4 PALMYRA CODE § 167-4
159:178
§ 167-5. Required improvements. [Amended 8-1-2016 by L.L. No.
1-2016]
development proposed in the subdivision, and especially in largescale
neighborhood unit developments, the Zoning Board of
Appeals/Planning Board may recommend that the Village Board
require the dedication, or reservation, of areas in excess of the fivepercent
minimum. Under such conditions, a money payment at fair
market value will be made to the owner to compensate his loss in
excess of the five-percent contribution.
F. Street trees. No street trees shall be planted within the street right-ofway
nor within 10 feet of any street right-of-way line.
A. Monuments and lot corner markers. Monuments shall be placed at all
block corners, angle points of curves in streets and at intermediate
points as required by the Engineer. The monuments shall be of such
material, size and length as may be approved by the Engineer.
B. Utility and street improvements.
(1) Utility and street improvements shall be provided in each new
subdivision in accordance with the standards and requirements
described in the following schedules. The developer shall furnish a
performance bond sufficient to cover the full costs of the
construction of said utility and street improvements in accordance
with § 179-l of the Village Law.56 The developer may install such
utility and street improvements or, in the alternative, may arrange
with the Village to install such utility and street improvements
pursuant to pertinent laws of the State of New York.
(2) The standards and specifications for each general type of
development shall be as follows:
(a) For multiple dwellings and other residential types other than
one-family detached dwellings, improvements shall be in
accord with Standard A.
(b) For one-family detached dwellings in the areas where sanitary
sewers are available or accessible, improvements shall be in
accord with Standard B.
(c) For one-family dwellings with lot sufficiently large to meet the
requirements of the Plumbing Code, if any, of the Village and
located in the areas where sewers are not available or
accessible, improvements shall be in accord with Standard C.
(d) For commercial, industrial and other types, improvements
shall be as determined by the Zoning Board of Appeals/
Planning Board with the advice of the Engineer.

tax equal to 1% of its gross operating income from and after the first day of
September 1970 is hereby imposed upon every other utility doing business
in the Village of Palmyra, New York, which has a gross operating income
for the 12 months ending August 31, in excess of $500, which taxes shall

imposed by any other provision of law. Such taxes shall not be imposed on

associations, copartnerships, estates, assignees of rent, any person

districts.
UTILITY  Includes every person subject to the supervision of the State
Department of Public Service, except persons engaged in the business of
operating or leasing sleeping and parlor railroad cars or operating railroads
other than street surface, rapid transit, subway and elevated railroads, and
also includes every person (whether or not such person is subject to such
supervision) who sells gas, electricity, steam, water, refrigeration, telephony
or telegraphy, delivered through mains, pipes or wires, or furnishes gas,
electricity, steam, water, refrigeration, telephone or telegraph service by
means of mains, pipes or wires, regardless of whether such activities are
the main business of such person or are only incidental thereto, or whether
use is made of the public streets.
§ 172-3. Records to be kept by utility.
Every utility subject to tax under this article shall keep such records of its
business and in such form as the Village Treasurer or the Village Board
may require. Such records shall be preserved for a period of three years,

destruction within that period or may require that they be kept longer.
§ 172-4. Filing by utility.
Every utility subject to tax hereunder shall file annually, on or before the
25th day of February, a return for the 12 calendar months ending the 31st

§ 172-2 PALMYRA CODE § 172-4
172:186
12 calendar months preceding such return date of any portion thereof for
which the tax imposed hereby is effective; provided, however, that in lieu
of the annual return required by the foregoing provisions, any utility may
file quarterly on or before September 25, December 25, March 25 and June
25, a return for the three calendar months preceding each such return date,
and in the case of the first such return, for all preceding calendar months
during which the tax imposed hereby was effective. Every return shall state
the gross income or gross operating income for the period covered thereby.
Returns shall be filed with the Village Treasurer on a form to be furnished
by him for such purpose and shall contain such other data, information or
matter as he may require to be included therein. The Village Treasurer,
in order to ensure payment of the tax imposed, may require at any time
a further or supplemental return, which shall contain any data that may
be specified by him, and he may require any utility doing business in the
Village of Palmyra, New York, to file an annual return, which shall contain
any data specified by him, regardless of whether the utility is subject to
tax under this article. Every return shall have annexed thereto an affidavit
of the head of the utility making the same, or of the owner or copartner
thereof, or of a principal officer of the corporation, if such business is
conducted by a corporation, to the effect that the statements contained
therein are true.
§ 172-5. Payment of tax.
At the time of filing a return as required by this article, each utility shall
pay to the Village of Palmyra the tax imposed by this article for the period
covered by such return. Such tax shall be due and payable at the time of
filing the return, or, if a return is not filed when due, on the last day on
which the return is required to be filed.
§ 172-6. Sufficiency of return.
A. In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the Village Treasurer, and if a corrected or sufficient
return is not filed within 20 days after the same is required by notice
from him, or if no return is made for any period, the Village Treasurer
shall determine the amount of tax due from such information as he is
able to obtain, and if necessary, may estimate the tax on the basis of
external indices or otherwise. He shall give notice of such
determination to the person liable for such tax. Such determination
shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax, unless the person against
whom it is assessed shall, within 30 days after the giving of notice of
such determination, apply to the Village Treasurer for a hearing, or
unless the Village Treasurer of his own motion shall reduce the same.
After such hearing, the Village Treasurer shall give notice of his
decision to the person liable for the tax. Such decision may be reviewed
by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of
the State of New York if application therefor is made within 90 days
after the giving of notice of such decision. An order to review such
decision shall not be granted unless the amount of any tax sought to be
§ 172-4 TAXATION § 172-6
172:187
§ 172-7. Notice.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may
be given by mailing the same to the persons for whom it is intended, in a
postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address given by him
in the last return filed by him under this article, or, if no return has been
filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to
whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the
provisions of this article by the giving of notice shall commence to run from
the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 172-8. Failure to file; penalty.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return, or to pay any tax
or any portion thereof, within the time required by this article shall be
subject to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due, plus 1% of such tax
for each month of delay or fraction thereof, excepting the first month, after
such return was required to be filed or such tax became due. The Village
Treasurer, for cause shown, may extend the time for filing any return; and
if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any portion of the
penalty fixed by the foregoing provisions of this section.
§ 172-9. Refund.
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer thereof
shall make application for a refund thereof, and the Village Treasurer or
the court shall determine that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof
was erroneously or illegally collected, the Village Treasurer shall refund
the amount so determined. For like cause and within the same period, a
refund may be so made on the initiative of the Village Treasurer. However,
no refund shall be made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination
of the Village Treasurer as hereinbefore provided, unless the Village
reviewed, with interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall be first
deposited with the Village Treasurer and an undertaking filed with him,
in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the Supreme Court
shall approve, to the effect that, if such proceeding be dismissed or
the tax confirmed, the applicant will pay all costs and charges which
may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding, or at the option of
the applicant, such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to cover the
tax, interest, penalties, costs and charges aforesaid, in which event the
applicant shall not be required to pay such tax, interest and penalties
as a condition precedent to the granting of such order.
B. Except in the case of a willfully false or fraudulent return with intent to
evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the
expiration of more than three years from the date of the filing of a
return; provided, however, that where no return has been filed as
required by this article, the tax may be assessed at any time.
§ 172-6 PALMYRA CODE § 172-9
172:188
Treasurer, after a hearing as hereinbefore provided, or of his own motion,
shall have reduced the tax or penalty or if it shall have been established in a
proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the State
of New York that such determination was erroneous or illegal. All refunds
shall be made out of moneys collected under this article. An application for
a refund, made as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an application for
the revision of any tax or penalty complained of and the Village Treasurer
may receive additional evidence with respect thereto. After making his
determination, the Village Treasurer shall give notice thereof to the person
interested, and he shall be entitled to an order to review such determination
under said Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the State of
New York, subject to the provision hereinbefore contained relating to the
granting of such an order.
§ 172-10. Adding tax to bills prohibited.
The tax imposed by this article shall be charged against and be paid by the
utility and shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by the
utility to customers or others but shall constitute a part of the operating
costs of such utility.
§ 172-11. Failure to pay tax; lien.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this
article, the Village Attorney shall, upon the request of the Village Board,
bring an action to enforce payment of the same. The proceeds of any
judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to the Village Treasurer,
Each such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person
liable to pay the same, in the same manner and to the same extent that the
tax and penalty imposed by the Tax Law, § 186-a, is made a lien.
§ 172-12. Rules and regulations of Treasurer.
In the administration of this article, the Village Treasurer shall have power
to make such reasonable rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law,
as may be necessary for the exercise of his powers and the performance of
his duties, and to prescribe the form of blanks, reports and other records
relating to the administration and enforcement of the tax, to take testimony
and proofs, under oath, with reference to any matter within the line of his
official duty under this article, and to subpoena and require the attendance
of witnesses and the production of books, papers and documents.
§ 172-13. Disclosure by Treasurer; penalties for offenses.
A. Except in accordance with proper judicial order or as otherwise
provided by law, it shall be unlawful for the Village Treasurer, or any
agent, clerk or employee of the Village of Palmyra, New York, to divulge
or make known in any manner the amount of gross income or gross
operating income, or any particulars set forth or disclosed in any return
under this article. The officer charged with the custody of such returns

contained in them in any action or proceeding in any court, except on
behalf of the Village of Palmyra, New York, in an action or proceeding
under the provisions of this article, or on behalf of the State Tax
Commission in an action or proceeding under the provisions of the Tax
Law of the State of New York, or on behalf of any party to any action
or proceeding under the provisions of this article when the returns or
facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding,
in either of which events the court may require the production of, and
may admit in evidence, so much of said returns or of the facts shown
thereby as are pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more.
B. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a person,
or his duly authorized representative, of a copy of any return filed by
him, nor to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to
prevent the identification of particular returns and the items thereof, or
the publication of delinquent lists showing the names of persons who
have failed to pay their taxes at the time and in the manner provided for
by this article, together with any relevant information which in the
opinion of the Village Treasurer may assist in the collection of such
delinquent taxes; or the inspection by the Village Attorney or other
legal representative of the Village of Palmyra, New York, of the return
of any person who shall bring action to set aside or review the tax based
thereon, or against whom an action has been instituted in accordance
with the provisions of this article.

punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or by imprisonment not
exceeding one year, or both, and if the offender be an officer, agent,

may exchange with the chief fiscal officer of any city or any other village
in the State of New York information contained in returns filed under
this article, provided such city or other village grants similar privileges
to the Village of Palmyra, New York, and provided such information is to

may result from allowing such meter to become frozen, burned, injured or
damaged by hot water or steam, shall be paid to the Village of Palmyra
on demand. Whenever an owner of premises shall fail to comply, or shall
fail to procure compliance by a tenant or other occupant of the premises,
with the provisions of this section, the Village of Palmyra in addition to all

other enterprise, using and maintaining any water facilities to the
practical exclusion of any other occupant of the same premises.

claiming to be overcharged may apply in writing to the Village Clerk within
15 days after the bill is rendered, deposit a sum in an amount as set from
time to time by resolution of the Board of Trustees and request the meter to
be tested. If the meter is found to be correct or to underregister the amount
of water, such deposit will be retained by the Village of Palmyra in payment
of the testing charge. Should the meter be found to overregister the amount
of water, the deposit will be returned and proper correction made in the
bill for the quarter the bill covers only. The Village Clerk or water cashier

incorrect reading of the meter or to a fault in the meter, but for no other
reason.

§ 189-21. Administration.
§ 189-22. Requirements of Department and owners.
A. The Department will operate a cross-connection control program, to
include the keeping of necessary records, which fulfills the
requirements of the Commission's cross-connection regulations and is
approved by the Commission.
B. The owner shall allow his property to be inspected for possible crossconnections
and shall follow the provisions of the Department's
program and the Commission's regulations if a cross-connection is
permitted.
C. If the Department requires that the public supply be protected by
containment, the owner shall be responsible for water quality beyond
the outlet end of the containment. He may utilize public health officials
or personnel from the Department, or their delegated representatives,
to assist him in the survey of his facilities and to assist him in the
selection of proper fixture outlet devices and the proper installation of
these devices.
A. Department.
(1) On new installations, a professional engineer will provide on-site
evaluation and/or inspection of plans in order to determine the type
of backflow preventer, if any, that will be required; will issue permit
and perform inspection and testing. In any case, a minimum of a
dual check valve will be required in any new construction. All plans
must be approved by the New York State Department of Health.
(2) For premises existing prior to the start of this program, a
professional engineer will perform evaluations and inspections of
plans and/or premises and inform the owner by letter of any
corrective action deemed necessary, the method of achieving the
correction, and the time allowed for the correction to be made.
Ordinarily, 90 days will be allowed; however, this time period may
§ 189-20 PALMYRA CODE § 189-22
178:228
be shortened depending upon the degree of hazard involved and
the history of the device(s) in question.
(3) The Department will not allow any cross-connection to remain
unless it is protected by an approved backflow preventer for which
a permit has been issued and which will be regularly tested to
insure satisfactory operation.
(4) The Department shall inform the owner by letter of any failure to
comply by the time of the first reinspection. The Department will
allow an additional 15 days for the correction. In the event the
owner fails to comply with the necessary correction by the time of
the second reinspection, the Department will inform the owner by
letter that the water service to the owner's premises will be
terminated within a period not to exceed five days. In the event that
the owner informs the Department of extenuating circumstances as
to why the correction has not been made, a time extension may be
granted by the Department but in no case will exceed an additional
30 days.
(5) If the Department determines at any time that a serious threat to
the public health exists, the water service will be terminated
immediately.
(6) The Department shall have on file a list of private contractors who
are certified New York State backflow device testers. All charges
for these tests will be paid by the owner of the building or property.
(7) The Department will begin initial premises' inspections to
determine the nature of existing or potential hazards, following the
approval of this program by the Commission, during the calendar
year 2005. Initial focus will be on high-hazard industries and
commercial premises.
B. Owner.
(1) The owner shall be responsible for the elimination or protection of
all cross-connections on his premises.
(2) The owner, after having been informed by a letter from the
Department, shall, at his expense, install, maintain and test, or
have tested, any and all backflow preventers on his premises.
(3) The owner shall correct any malfunction of the backflow preventer
which is revealed by periodic testing.
(4) The owner shall inform the Department of any proposed or
modified cross-connections and also any existing cross-connections
of which the owner is aware but have not been found by the
Department.
(5) The owner shall not install a bypass around any backflow preventer
unless there is a backflow preventer of the same type on the
§ 189-22 TREES § 189-22
178:229
§ 189-23. Degree of hazard.
The Department recognizes the threat to the public water system arising
from cross-connections. All threats will be classified by degree of hazard
and will require the installation of approved reduced-pressure-principle
backflow prevention devices or double check valves.
§ 189-24. Permits.
The Department shall not permit a cross-connection within the public water
supply system unless it is considered necessary and that it cannot be
eliminated.
§ 189-25. Existing in-use backflow prevention devices.
Any existing backflow preventer shall be allowed by the Department to
continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the
effectiveness of the present backflow preventer or result in an unreasonable
bypass. Owners who cannot shut down operation for testing of the
device(s) must supply additional devices necessary to allow testing
to take place.
(6) The owner shall install backflow preventers in a manner approved
by the New York State Department of Health.
(7) The owner shall install only backflow preventers approved by the
Department or the Commission.
(8) Any owner having a private well or other private water source shall
not be permitted to cross connect to the Department's water
system.
(9) In the event the owner installs plumbing to provide potable water
for domestic purposes which is on the Department's side of the
backflow preventer, such plumbing must have its own backflow
preventer installed.
(10) The owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for
permits, annual device testing, retesting in the case that the device
fails to operate correctly, and second reinspections for
noncompliance with Department or Commission requirements.
A. Cross-connection permits that are required for each backflow
prevention device are obtained from the Department. The fees charged
for such permits will be established by resolution of the Village Board.
B. Permits are nontransferable. Permits are subject to revocation and
become immediately revoked if the owner should so change the type of
cross-connection or degree of hazard associated with the service.
C. A permit is not required when fixture isolation is achieved with the
utilization of a nontestable backflow preventer.
§ 189-22 PALMYRA CODE § 189-25
178:230
risk to the public health. Where the degree of hazard has increased, as in
the case of a residential installation converting to a business establishment,
any existing backflow preventer must be upgraded to a reduced-pressureprinciple
device, or a reduced-pressure-principle device must be installed in
the event that no backflow device was present.
§ 189-26. Periodic testing.
§ 189-27. Records and reports.
§ 189-28. Fees and charges.
A. Reduced-pressure-principle backflow devices shall be tested and
inspected annually.
B. Periodic testing shall be performed by a New York State certified tester.
A copy of the New York State test report also needs to be sent to the
Palmyra Water Department, 144 East Main Street, Palmyra, NY, 14522.
This testing will be done at the owner's expense.
C. Any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test will be
repaired or replaced. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of
the repair, the device will be retested at the owner's expense to insure
correct operation. High-hazard situations will not be allowed to
continue unprotected if the backflow preventer fails the test and cannot
be repaired immediately. In other situations, a compliance date of not
more than 30 days after the test date will be established. The owner is
responsible for spare parts, repair tools, or a replacement device.
Parallel installation of two devices is an effective means of the owner
insuring uninterrupted water service during testing or repair of devices
and is strongly recommended when the owner desires such continuity.
A. Records. The Department will initiate and maintain the copies of lists
and summaries supplied to the Commission.
B. Reports. The Department will submit the following to the Commission:
(1) Initial listing of low-hazard cross-connections to the state.
(2) Initial listing of high-hazard cross-connections to the state.
(3) Annual update lists of Subsections B(1) and (2) above.
(4) Annual summary of cross-connection inspections to the state.
A. The Department will publish a list of fees or charges for the following
services or permits:
(1) Testing fees.
(2) Retesting fees.
(3) Fee for reinspection.
§ 189-25 TREES § 189-28
178:231
§ 189-29. Strainers.
The Department strongly recommends that all new retrofit installations
of reduced-pressure-principle devices and double-check-valve backflow
preventers include the installation of strainers located immediately
upstream of the backflow device. The installation of strainers will preclude
the fouling of backflow devices due to both foreseen and unforeseen
circumstances occurring to the water supply system such as water main
repairs, water main breaks, fires, periodic cleaning and flushing of mains,
etc. These occurrences may stir up debris within the water main that will
cause fouling of backflow devices installed without the benefit of strainers.
§ 189-30. Amendments. [Amended 5-16-2005 by L.L. No. 5-2005]
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Palmyra reserves the right to change,
amend, repeal or add to this chapter at any time.
(4) Charges for after-hours inspections or tests.
B. These fees may be changed from time to time by resolution of the
Palmyra Village Board.

General Provisions
§ 200-1. Enacting clause; legislative authority.
The Village Board of the Village of Palmyra in the County of Wayne, under
the authority of the Village Law of the State of New York, hereby ordains,
enacts and publishes as follows.
§ 200-2. Title.
This chapter shall be known as Local Law No. 3 of 1967, and the map
referred to herein and made a part of this chapter shall be known as the
Zoning District Map.63
§ 200-3. When effective.
This chapter shall be effective immediately.
§ 200-4. Zoning Board of Appeals/Planning Board. [Amended
8-1-2016 by L.L. No. 2-2016]
The Village of Palmyra Planning Board is hereby abolished. All functions of
the Planning Board are hereby transferred to the Zoning Board of Appeals,
to be known hereafter as the "Zoning Board of Appeals/Planning Board"
("ZBA/Planning Board"). All references to either "Planning Board" or
"Zoning Board of Appeals" contained in the Code of the Village of Palmyra
shall be replaced with the term "Zoning Board of Appeals/Planning Board."
§ 200-5. Conflict with other regulations.
Where a provision of this chapter is found to be in conflict with or in any
other local law of the Village existing on the effective date of this chapter, or
in any regulation issued under the authority of such code or ordinance, the
provision which establishes the higher standard for the protection of health,
safety and welfare shall prevail.
§ 200-6. Purpose.
A. The purposes of this chapter are set forth in general terms in the Village
Law which enables the Village to adopt this chapter. The provisions of
this chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
protection of the health, safety and welfare of the people at large, and
are designed to encourage the establishment and maintenance of
reasonable standards of the physical environment.
B. It is fundamental for the purpose of this chapter to recognize that some
existing lots in the Village are more difficult to use for the intended
purpose because of location, size, slope or general topography. Usually
63.Editor's Note: The current Zoning District Map is on file in the office of the Village Clerk.

such differences will not make use of a lot impractical, although such
use may require greater expense or ingenuity. Where such lots cannot
practically be used for a permitted use, the remedy of variance is
available to permit modifications in yard or other requirements to make
possible a use generally permitted in the district, but not to permit a
more intensive use. Difficulty in using land for a permitted dwelling
because of topography problems should not justify use of the land
for a commercial use not normally permitted but should justify only
accommodation in the regulations so as to facilitate a dwelling.
C. It is the further intent that the administration of this chapter, where it
affects properties near or adjacent to the Village boundary lines, will be
such as to promote administrative cooperation with bordering
municipalities for the benefit and protection of all properties.
D. This section, together with all provisions of the chapter, shall be
considered when appraising the spirit of this chapter as a guide to its
interpretation.

To carry out the purposes of this chapter, the area of the Village is hereby
divided into the following types of districts. For convenience in discussion,
in the text and on the Zoning District Map, each district has been assigned
an identifying short title. Such short title may be used in the text or on the
Zoning Map to identify the district.

§ 200-10. District relationships.
No ranking or hierarchy is intended among districts; for example, a
residential district is not necessarily considered a higher type of district
than a commercial district. Each district is designed to provide optimum
conditions for the intended uses. Uses permitted in a residential district
are, therefore, not automatically permitted in a commercial district, nor
are commercial uses necessarily permitted in an industrial district. For
convenience, and where applicable, uses may be permitted by reference
when they are identical in several districts.
§ 200-11. Zoning District Map.
A. Establishment. The locations of the districts enumerated in preceding
§ 200-9, and the boundaries of such districts, are hereby established as
shown upon the map which is attached hereto and made a part of this
chapter, being designated as the Zoning District Map. The said Map
and all the notations, references and other information shown thereon
shall be as much a part of this chapter as if the matters and information
set forth by said Map were all fully described herein.70

B. Boundary determination. The boundaries of districts shall be as shown
by heavy solid lines on the Zoning District Map. Where uncertainty
exists as to any of said boundaries as shown on said Map, the following
rules shall apply:
(1) Where such boundaries are indicated as approximately following
the center lines of streets, alleys, railroads, streams or canals, such
center lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
(2) Where such boundaries are indicated as approximately following
the boundary lines of parks or reservations, such lines shall be
construed to be such boundaries.
(3) Where such boundaries are indicated as approximately following
lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
(4) In unsubdivided land and where a district boundary divides a lot,
the location of such boundary, unless the same is indicated by
dimensions shown on the Map, shall be determined by the use of
the scale appearing thereon.

variance shall be granted by the Board of Appeals without a
showing by the applicant that applicable zoning regulations and
restrictions have caused unnecessary hardship. In order to prove
such unnecessary hardship, the applicant shall demonstrate to the
Board of Appeals that:
(a) Under the applicable zoning regulations, the applicant cannot
realize a reasonable return, provided that lack of return is

is unique, and does not apply to a substantial portion of the
district or neighborhood;

essential character of the neighborhood; and
(d) That the alleged hardship has not been self-created.
(2) The Board of Appeals, in the granting of use variances, shall grant

(1) The Board of Appeals shall have the power, upon an appeal from a
decision or determination of law, to grant area variances from the
area or dimensional requirements of this chapter. In making its
determination, the Board of Appeals shall take into consideration
the benefit to the applicant if the variance is granted, as weighed
against the detriment to the health, safety, and welfare of the
neighborhood or community by such grant. In making such
determination the Board shall also consider:
(a) Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the
character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby
properties will be created by the granting of the area variance;
§ 200-45 TREES § 200-45
178:303
(b) Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved
by some method feasible for the applicant to pursue, other
than an area variance;
(c) Whether the requested area variance is substantial;
(d) Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect or
impact on the physical or environmental conditions in the
neighborhood or district; and
(e) Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which
consideration shall be relevant to the decision of the Board of
Appeals, but shall not necessarily preclude the granting of the
area variance.
(2) The Board of Appeals, in the granting of area variances, shall grant
the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and adequate
and at the same time preserve and protect the character of the
neighborhood and the health, safety, and welfare of the community.
D. Special permit. In any instance in which the Board of Appeals is
required to consider a proposed special permit, it shall not authorize or
approve the proposed permit unless and until it shall first:
(1) Assure itself that the proposed permit is consistent with the spirit,
purpose or intent of this chapter and any additional statement of
purpose applying to the particular section.
(2) Determine that the proposed permit meets the conditions
prescribed therefor in the text of this chapter.
(3) Determine that the proposed special permit will not substantially
detract from the use of adjoining property and require such
provisions as may be necessary to afford adequate protection for
such adjoining property.
(4) Determine that the streets serving the use are adequate for the
requirements, and conditions of traffic will not be created that will
adversely affect the neighborhood.
(5) Consider the effect of the proposed change upon the logical,
efficient and economical provision of public services and facilities
such as public water, sewers, police and fire protection, public
schools and streets.
(6) Determine that any special standards set forth herein for the
particular use are fully met.79

contrary to the provisions of this chapter or a permit issued under it,
the Zoning Administrator may order the work stopped by notice in
writing served on anyone engaged in such work or causing such work to
be done and such person shall forthwith stop such work until notice is
received in writing that such stop-work order has been withdrawn or
canceled.
A. Building permit.
(1) Permit requirement. A building permit shall be required prior to
the erection, alteration of or addition to any building or structure.
It shall be unlawful for any person to commence work requiring a

dimensions, street address and map numbers; the names of
abutting streets; the location, dimensions and uses of any
existing buildings on the lot.
(b) The location, dimensions and proposed use of buildings for
which the permit is sought.

entire time of the prosecution of the work.
(4) Time limit. If the work for which a building permit has been issued
is not commenced within 60 days after the date of issuance of the
permit, or if commenced, ceases for a period exceeding 60 days or
such longer period as the Zoning Administrator may authorize in
writing in recognition of the occurrence of conditions unforeseen at
the time of issuance of the permit, the permit shall expire and a
new permit shall be required before such work is commenced.

or extended shall be used or changed in use until a certificate of
occupancy shall have been issued by the Zoning Administrator,
except that no occupancy permit shall be required for a permitted
sign three square feet or less in area. A certificate of occupancy,
however, shall not be required for the occupancy or use of a one- or

completed, or has progressed to an extent that compliance with the
terms of the building permit is finally ascertainable, finds that the
building may be safely occupied and finds that provisions for use
are in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, he shall issue
the certificate of occupancy. If the request is denied, the Zoning
Administrator shall issue to the applicant a written statement
containing the reasons for such denial.
C. Certificate of occupancy for use of land.
(1) Requirement. No land or existing building shall be put to a different
type of use than that existing immediately previous until a
certificate of occupancy has been granted by the Zoning
Administrator, nor shall a nonconforming use be changed or
extended without a certificate of occupancy.
(2) Application. Written application to the Zoning Administrator shall
be made in the same manner as for use of a building.
(3) Review and action. If the Zoning Administrator shall find that a
requested use for which a certificate is requested is in conformity

ordinances, he shall issue such permit. If such request is denied,
the Zoning Administrator shall issue to the applicant a written
statement containing the reasons for such denial.

shall be in addition to any other remedies provided by law.

required for any further occupancy or use of such building or land.
C. In the opinion of the Zoning Administrator, if such violation or unlawful
use tends to jeopardize health, life or limb, he may order its use to cease
and desist forthwith and any further use or occupancy of such property
shall be unlawful until the violation or unlawful use is terminated and a
new certificate of occupancy or use permit is issued.

PROCUREMENT POLICY
§ A206-1. Adoption and intent.
The Village of Palmyra does hereby adopt the following procurement policy
which is intended to apply to all goods and services which are not required
by law to be publicly bid.
§ A206-2. Procurement procedure.

corporation which under a specific state statute may be accepted as
security for deposit of public moneys.
C. Obligations issued by states (other than the State of New York) of the
United States rated in one of the three highest rating categories by a

request for proposals
(2) Public works contracts.

A206:318
§ A206-3. Procedures waived under certain circumstances.
Pursuant to General Municipal Law § 104-b, Subdivision 2f, the
procurement policy may contain circumstances when, or types of
procurements for which, in the sole discretion of the governing body, the
solicitation of alternative proposals or quotations will not be in the best
interest of the municipality. In the following circumstances it may not be in
the best interests of the Village of Palmyra to solicit quotations or document
the basis for not accepting the lowest bid:
Estimated Amount of
Public Works Contract
Method
$250 to $999 2 verbal quotes
$1,000 to $4,999 2 written/fax quotes
$5,000 to $19,999 3 written/fax quotes or written
request for proposals
B. A good faith effort shall be made to obtain the required number of
proposals or quotations. If the purchaser is unable to obtain the
required number of proposals or quotations, the purchaser will
document the attempt made at obtaining the proposals. In no event
shall the failure to obtain the proposals be a bar to the procurement.
C. Documentation is required of each action taken in connection with each
procurement.
D. Documentation and an explanation is required whenever a contract is
awarded to other than the lowest responsible offeror. This
documentation will include an explanation of how the award will
achieve savings or how the offeror was not responsible. A
determination that the offeror is not responsible shall be made by the
purchaser and may not be challenged under any circumstances.
A. Professional services or service requiring special or technical skill,
training or expertise. The individual or company must be chosen based
on accountability, reliability, responsibility, skill, education and training,
judgement, integrity, and moral worth. These qualifications are not
necessarily found in the individual or company that offers the lowest
price and the nature of these services are such that they do not readily
lend themselves to competitive procurement procedures. In
determining whether a service fits into this category the Board of
Trustees shall take into consideration the following guidelines: whether
the services are subject to state licensing or testing requirements;
whether substantial formal education or training is a necessary
prerequisite to the performance of the services; and whether the
services require a personal relationship between the individual and
municipal officials. Professional or technical services shall include but
not be limited to the following: services of an attorney, services of a
physician, technical services of an engineer engaged to prepare plans,

management services; printing services involving extensive writing,
editing or art work, management of municipality owned property; and
computer software or programming services for customized programs,
or services involved in substantial modification and customizing of
prepackaged software.
B. Emergency purchases pursuant to § 103, Subdivision 4, of the General
Municipal Law. Due to the nature of this exception, these goods or
services must be purchased immediately and a delay in order to seek
alternate proposals may threaten the life, health, safety or welfare of
the residents. This does not preclude alternate proposals if time
permits.
C. Purchases of surplus and secondhand goods. If alternate proposals are
required, the Village is precluded from purchasing surplus and
secondhand goods at auctions or through specific advertised sources
where the best prices are usually obtained. It is also difficult to try to
compare prices of used goods and a lower price may indicate an older
product.
D. Goods and services under $250. The time and documentation required
to purchase through this policy may be more costly than the item itself
and would therefore not be in the best interests of the taxpayer. In
addition, it is not likely that such de minimis contracts would be
awarded based on favoritism.
E. Purchase orders. Goods and services valued at $250 or above will be
contracted for through the use of a purchase order. A blanket purchase
order will be issued for no more than $500.
