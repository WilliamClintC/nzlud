PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Sparks, Nevada. 
Title, Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The title, chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of three parts separated by a period. The figure before the first period refers to the title number, the figure after the first period refers to the chapter number and the figure after the second period refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of title 1, chapter 1 is numbered 1.01.020. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents the title of a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a title of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the title. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
MUNICIPAL CODE TITLE T1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 CODE INDEX CDI:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Janet Cramer, Editor, and Eric Grant, Vice President, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Linda Patterson, City Clerk and the other members of the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Municipal Code which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

The use of procedures established in this chapter, except as specifically provided otherwise, shall be in lieu of criminal sanctions.

D.  No person and no business entity shall be required to disclose any trade secret to any city inspector. If there is a dispute between a city inspector and any person or business entity over whether any location or thing is exempt from inspection because it contains a trade secret, an attempt shall be made to settle the matter by devising a way to open part or all of the area or device for inspection, with the trade secret information removed or covered. If the matter cannot be resolved, the city inspector shall not look at the place or item until and unless the city has obtained a ruling from a court permitting inspection of the item or place.

Section 5.16.025 - Grounds for summary suspension of license. 
A.  Any license issued pursuant to this title is subject to summary suspension by order of the chief of police or by order of the fire chief whenever there is probable cause to believe that extraordinary circumstances have arisen which are an immediate threat to the public health, safety or welfare and that business operations pursuant to that license increase the level of that threat. 
B.  An order of the chief of police or the fire chief pursuant to this section prevails over all other provisions of this title pertaining to suspension of a business license. A suspension may continue until the conditions warranting the order have ceased. 
(Ord. 2471, § 29, Add, 2/11/2013) 
Section 5.16.027 - Unlawful to fail to keep and maintain adequate records and provide them upon demand-Unlawful to underreport gross revenues.

C.  It is unlawful for any licensee who is required to pay a license fee based on gross revenues to make a material and intentional understatement of the licensee's gross revenues for any licensing period. In determining materiality, the fact that the underreporting results in a ten-percent lower business license fee is conclusive proof of materiality. A criminal conviction under this section does not prohibit the non-renewal, suspension or revocation of a business license on grounds that the licensee made a material and intentional underreporting of gross receipts.

D.  Upon completion of the background investigation (if required), and based on the requirements of this chapter, the chief of police shall determine whether the applicant is qualified to receive an alcoholic beverage license. The chief of police shall deny any application for any reason enumerated in SMC 5.28.170 or 5.28.300.

The application must be made to the chief licensing officer, the applicant must be investigated (if required) by the chief of police and the premises must be inspected and approved in the manner required for an initial license. The 30-day period described in this subsection is deemed to be the grace period described in SMC 5.12.090.

Upon receiving proof that the owner or agent of the new business described in subsection A has filed an application with the chief licensing officer pursuant to subsection A and has also filed an application for a license investigation (if required) with the chief of police and paid any required investigation fees, and upon receiving from the applicant a $1,000.00 cash bond, the chief licensing officer shall issue a temporary alcoholic beverage license to the applicant which is valid for a period of 90 days. A temporary license allows the new applicant to operate the business pending the investigation by the chief of police. If the chief of police approves the applicant for the required alcoholic beverage license and the chief licensing officer issues such license, the cash bond shall be refunded to the applicant. However, if the investigation or other factors show that the applicant does not qualify for the required license and the chief of police denies the license, the temporary license becomes void immediately upon such a denial and the cash bond is thereupon forfeited to the city by operation of law. 
C.  Temporary License Not Required if No Police Investigation is Required. If the sole owner or entity acquiring the majority of the business is not required to undergo a police background investigation pursuant to SMC 5.28.220, the owner of agent of the entity is not required to obtain a temporary license under subsection B. Such an applicant may operate under the existing license until the application is approved or denied. 
D.  Penalty for Failure of Acquiring Person or Entity to Comply. If an owner or agent of the person or entity acquiring the majority of the business fails to comply with subsections A and B by timely filing a new application with the chief licensing officer and with the chief of police for an investigation (if required), obtaining a temporary license (if required) and paying all required fees within the 30-day grace period, the application shall be deemed delinquent and subject to the same delinquent fees as a failure to renew a license set forth in SMC 5.12.105. 
E.  Change of Name. A business which has changed its name must inform the chief licensing officer and the chief of police of that fact in writing within 15 working days after the change in name is actually made to the business signage. There is no fee for a change in name if the name of the licensee does not change. 
F.  Definition. For purposes of this section, a "material change of ownership" means a transfer of more than 50 percent of ownership interest when compared to the total ownership interest of all persons.

A.  Every person who owns or operates within the limits of the city any hotel, motel, building comprised of former hotel or motel rooms which have been converted into apartments, tenement, boarding or rooming house, recreational vehicle park or other establishment where rooms or spaces for lodging are available to rent or lease on a temporary basis shall keep and maintain a registration system and shall require the name, date of birth and residential addresses, including city or town and state, of every person who rents or occupies a room or space in any such establishment to be written in the register, or upon a registration card, or entered into an electronic registration system. Every such registration shall contain a reference to the day of the year, month and week, and the time of day, the person rents or arranges to occupy such room or space. 
Every person who rents or occupies such a room shall produce a photographic identification card issued by a governmental agency of the United States or a State in the United States. The person's name, date of birth and residential address on the identification card should match the information entered in the registration system. 
If there is a discrepancy between the photographic identification and the information provided by the renter or occupant, the owner or operator of the establishment shall create a unique identifier (e.g., a letter, word or symbol) and place it next to the entry in the registration system. Upon inquiry into a registration system by a peace officer, the owner or operator shall inform the officer that a unique identifier exists for any person entered in the registration system and explain any discrepancy in the registration. 
B.  For purposes of this chapter: 
1.  "Registration system" means a system of registration contained in a registration book, in a card file or in an electronic database. 
2.  "Available to rent or lease on a temporary basis" means a rental or lease which is reasonably expected to have a tenancy of less than six months. An establishment which allows rent or lease payments to be paid on a daily, weekly or bi-weekly (every two weeks) basis is deemed to be for "rent or lease on a temporary basis," regardless of the type of property or the terms of any rental agreement or lease. 
(Ord. 2523, § 1, Amended, 4/25/2016; Ord. 942 § 1 (part), 1973: Ord. 723 § 6, 1968: 1962 Code § 25.605.) 
Section 5.52.020 - False information. 
    It is unlawful for any guest, roomer or lodger in any such establishment to use any name other than his or her true name in so registering, or to give any false or erroneous information as required by this chapter. 
(Ord. 942 § 1 (part), 1973: Ord. 723 § 7, 1968: 1962 Code § 25.610.) 
Section 5.52.030 - Unlawful to occupy room without registering. 
    It is unlawful for any person to occupy a room in any such establishment without entering or causing to be entered his or her true name in the register maintained by such establishment in compliance with the terms of this chapter.

Section 5.52.040 - Registration systems must be open for inspection; exception-Procedures for objecting to inspection. 
A.  Except as provided in subsection B, every registration system kept in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall, upon demand, be open for inspection or investigation by the chief of police, or his authorized agent, or for the inspection or investigation of any of the military police or any officer in any of the armed, naval or military services of the United States of America, or any agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, at any and all times. 
B.  Upon receiving a demand for inspection pursuant to subsection A, the owner or operator of an establishment may voluntarily allow inspection of the registration system or may immediately object orally to the inspection. If the owner or operator makes an oral objection or otherwise refuses to allow the inspection, and the law enforcement agency desires to enforce the demand, the officer must make the demand in writing and personally serve it on the owner or operator. The demand must be signed by the officer making the demand. No particular form of the demand is required, but the demand must set forth the name of the establishment, the date and time the demand is served on the establishment and the name of person served. A demand served pursuant to this section shall have attached thereto a form objection letter which may be used by the establishment to object to the demand. 
C.  If the owner or operator of an establishment receives a written demand pursuant to this section and the owner or operator desires to object to the demand, the owner or operator must make a written objection to the demand, with a copy of the demand attached, and personally serve it within 48 hours after receiving the demand. Service of the objection must be made on the officer making the demand or another officer of the same law enforcement agency as the officer who made the demand. No particular form of an objection is required, but the objection must be signed by the owner or operator, and set forth the date and time it is served on the officer or the agency. Failure to timely make and serve a written objection to a demand is a waiver of the establishment's right to seek pre-compliance judicial review of that demand. 
D.  An establishment which makes and serves an objection pursuant to this section may challenge the demand for inspection by filing an action in a court of competent jurisdiction within ten calendar days after the date the objection is served. Failure to timely file such an action is a waiver of the establishment's right to seek pre-compliance judicial review of that demand. 
E.  The owner or operator of an establishment that fails to timely make and serve a written objection, or that makes and serves a timely objection and then fails to timely file an action for pre-compliance judicial review, must open the establishment's registration system for inspection pursuant to subsection A immediately after the lapse of the period of time to make and serve a written objection or to file an action for pre-compliance judicial review, whichever is applicable. 
F.  Nothing in this section prohibits a law enforcement agency from obtaining access to any registration system pursuant to a warrant or ex parte warrant, or if an exception to the warrant requirement applies (e.g., consent or exigent circumstances). 
G.  Nothing in this section prohibits an officer possessing a reasonable, articulable suspicion that a registration system would be altered during pre-compliance review from guarding the registration system pending a decision of the court.

Section 5.52.045 - Unlawful to fail or refuse to allow inspection under certain circumstances.

A.  The law enforcement officer makes an oral demand for such inspection and the owner or operator of the establishment does not object to the demand, but then fails to allow the inspection. 
B.  The owner or operator of the establishment receives an oral demand for inspection and makes an oral objection to such inspection or otherwise refuses to allow the inspection. The law enforcement officer then issues a written demand for inspection pursuant to 5.52.040, but the owner or operator fails to timely make and serve a written objection pursuant to that section and thereafter fails or refuses to allow the inspection. 
C.  The owner or operator of an establishment receives an oral demand for inspection and makes an oral objection or otherwise refuses to allow the inspection. The law enforcement officer then serves a written demand for inspection pursuant to SMC 5.52.040 and the owner or operator timely makes and serves a written objection pursuant to that section, but thereafter fails to timely file an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for pre-compliance review of the police demand for inspection. Following that failure to timely file an action, which is a waiver of the owner's or operator's right to judicial review of the demand, the owner or operator then fails or refuses to allow such inspection. 
D.  The law enforcement officer and the owner or operator of the establishment each act in accordance with SMC 5.52.040 and the establishment files a proper action for pre-compliance judicial review, but the owner or operator is found by the court to have no right to fail or refuse to allow such an inspection, and the owner or operator thereafter fails or refuses to allow the inspection.

Chapter 5.78 - BOOTING 

Section 5.78.010 - Declaration of public policy. 
    It is declared to be the policy of the city council that the licensing and regulation of vehicle immobilization booting services is necessary because said services are neither licensed, regulated nor controlled by the State of Nevada. It is further declared that the booting of motor vehicles by private businesses should be regulated in order to alleviate some of the problems motorists have experienced, namely that their vehicles had been legally parked when booted, no signs had been posted indicating that their vehicles would be booted if improperly parked, that booting personnel were unresponsive and that booting charges were excessive when combined with subsequent towing charges. Since the immobilization of vehicles by booting is currently an unlicensed business activity, the city has been unable to address or prevent perceived abuses associated with the immobilization of vehicles by booting. The booting of vehicles can result in serious damage to vehicles and it is the intent of the city to protect motorists within the city from abusive booting business practices and unwarranted vehicular damage. This chapter will provide for the licensing of vehicle immobilization booting businesses, establish certain standards governing the booting of vehicles and thereby help to ensure that licensed booting companies do not wrongfully boot motor vehicles or engage in booting practices in such a manner as to endanger the public safety. The city council further finds that the licensing of vehicle immobilization booting companies will help to protect both the public and those companies from undue inconvenience and damage.

(Ord. 2348, Add, 01/27/2006) 
Section 9.06.175 - Scope of police duty; immunities preserved. 
    Neither the registration of alarms or the issuance of alarm permits creates a contract between the Police Department or the City and any alarm user, alarm installation company or monitoring company, nor does it create a duty or obligation, either expressed or implied, on the Police Department to respond to any alarm. Any and all liability and consequential damage resulting from the failure of the Police Department to respond to an alarm dispatch request is hereby disclaimed and full governmental immunity as provided by law is retained. By applying for an alarm registration, the alarm user acknowledges that the Police Department response is influenced by the availability of officers, priority of calls, weather conditions, traffic conditions, emergency condition and staffing levels.

A proposed parade or special event qualifies as "expressive" for purposes of this chapter if it expresses the opinions, views, ideas, concepts or emotions of its participants, and if it is an activity that is not defined as a special event in SMC 9.34.010. The determination whether a parade or special event qualifies as "expressive" must be made by the director or his designee with the approval of the City Attorney or his designee within 24 hours after the application is submitted to the director. 
B.

The applicant must cooperate and promptly provide answers in any inquiry. Failure to promptly provide answers to questions which are capable of being answered promptly is grounds to deny the application. If after that inquiry there is a reasonable, articulable doubt that the parade or special event is "expressive," , the special event shall be deemed "not expressive." 
D.  If a parade or special event is found to be "not expressive" pursuant to this section, the director or his designee shall promptly notify the applicant of that finding, the reasons for that finding and of the necessity to seek a special event permit pursuant to Chapter 9.34 of the SMC. 
E.

Section 9.35.040 - Police and parks departmental service charges; deposit. 
A.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, by this code or other applicable law, rule or regulation, as a condition precedent to receiving a permit the director or his designee shall require the applicant to deposit the estimated amount of city departmental service charges for police traffic control and department clean-up fees likely to occur by virtue of the permittee's actions during the requested activity. The total amount of fees due for the entire permit period must be paid to the department at least 4 hours before the date and time on which the applicant requests the permit to become effective. At the conclusion of the activity, the respective city departments shall calculate the actual cost of police traffic control and departmental clean-up and said sums must be deducted from the estimated amounts deposited by the permittee. Any difference must be timely refunded to the permittee. If the actual cost exceeds the estimated costs, the permittee shall pay the deficiency to the director or his designee within five days after demand therefore. 
B.  "Actual Costs" must be calculated by including the wages of support personnel (including fringe benefits), vehicle expenses (including a base hourly charge), equipment, materials and supplies. "Actual Costs" shall not include costs of clean up caused by persons not associated with the permittee (e.g., bystanders, onlookers, hecklers, etc.). 
C.  The estimated service charges for police traffic control and departmental clean-up must be calculated by the Chief of Police and the Director, or their designee, in conformance with the definition of "actual costs" contained in subsection B and must be based only upon the number of expected participants in the expressive parade or expressive special event and the impact the proposed activity will have on traffic flow and parking. The Chief of Police or his designee shall not consider any cost of police protection to the participants or to the public as a result of the activity, nor base any portion of the departmental service charge on the message of the applicant, the content of speech, the identity or associational relationships of the applicant, or upon any assumptions or predictions as to the amount of hostility which may be aroused in the public by the context of speech or the message conveyed by the activity or to the potential for violence occasioned by the activity. 
D.  The estimated departmental service charge for clean-up shall be calculated by the director of the department of parks and recreation or his designee in conformance with the definition of "actual costs" contained in subsection B, and must be based only upon the expected number of participants in the expressive parade or expressive special event and the relative difficulty of cleaning up the areas they will occupy during the event.

B.  Agree to defend, protect, indemnify and hold the City, its officers, employees, agents, and volunteers free and harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, expenses, loss and liability of any kind or nature whatsoever resulting from the alleged willful or negligent acts or omissions of permittee, its officers, agents, employees or members in connection with the permitted event or activity; or 
C.  Agree to, and actually undertake to, redesign or reschedule the permitted activity to respond to specific risks, hazards and dangers to the public health and safety identified by the city manager as being reasonably foreseeable consequences of the expressive parade or expressive special event. 
D.  The city manager may waive the requirement of this section if he and the city attorney agree that the proposed conduct of the permittee and its officers, agents, employees or members during the expressive parade or expressive special event poses no significant increase in the potential for harm to the general public and does not significantly increase the City's exposure to liability.

The applicant may appeal the denial to the city council by serving a Notice of Appeal on the City Manager within 5 working days after the denial. The appeal must be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of the city council in compliance with the Open Meeting Law. Judicial review may be taken from a denial by the city council.

Failure to submit complete financial information for each such person is deemed an incomplete request for waiver and the petition must be denied. 
B.  A waiver of the city departmental service charges must be granted if the applicant proves indigency by showing the following to the department: 
1.  For individuals: 
(a)  Receipt of benefits under Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and the State Supplemental Payments (SSP); 
(b)  Receipt of food stamps under the Food Stamps Program (7.U.S.C. § 2011, et seq.) or a similar State program;

(b)  That the organization does not possess funds equal to or greater than the deposit for estimated departmental service. 
C.  The decision to grant or deny a waiver of departmental service charges shall be rendered within 24 hours after receipt of an application and petition for waiver of charges. 
D.  An applicant who submits a petition for waiver of charges and complete financial information as required in subsection A and is denied a waiver of the city departmental service charges because the director or his designee finds that the applicant does not qualify for an indigency waiver under subsection B, and who nonetheless claims an inability to pay the deposit for such service charges, must be allowed to proceed with the requested expressive parade or expressive special event without paying the deposit if the subject matter of the activity involves a matter of immediate public concern or a public controversy that may lose its importance with the passage of time. 
E.  If an expressive parade or expressive special event is allowed pursuant to subsection D, and the City later discovers that the applicant falsely claimed an inability to pay the deposit for service charges, the city attorney may seek approval of the city council to institute legal action against the applicant and the persons named on the application as sponsoring or conducting the special event to compel the payment of the actual chargeable departmental service charges incurred by the city for the activity, plus costs and attorney's fees.

The amount to be refunded is the amount of the deposit, less charges for all compensable time spent by employees and all costs incurred by the City in preparation for the expressive parade or expressive special event. 
D.  Requests for refunds made more than 30 days after the date the activity was scheduled to commence must be considered by the director on a case-by-case basis, based on the amount of notice and formula set forth in subsections B and C.

A.  The increasing incidents of the defacement of public and private property through the application of graffiti upon walls, rocks, bridges, buildings, fences, gates, other structures, trees and other real and personal property within the corporate boundaries of the City promotes the organization of gangs and constitutes a blight on this community, and, in the interests of the health, safety and general welfare of the residents and taxpayers of the City, immediate steps must be taken to halt the spread of this blight. 
B.  The Sparks Police Department is aware of reports that such defacement of property is most often committed by persons under the age of 18 years using aerosol containers of spray paint and broad-tipped indelible markers. 
C.  When any such person has a legitimate need for such aerosol containers and markers, the same may be obtained and furnished by a parent or guardian. 
D.  Such aerosol containers and markers are frequently stolen from retail stores by minors. 
E.  The sale of such aerosol containers and broad-tipped markers to minors should therefore be prohibited, and persons who are engaged in the retail sale of such aerosol containers and markers should be required to take reasonable steps to prevent the theft of such aerosol containers and markers. 
F.  When appropriate, the court should require those who commit acts of defacement of public or private property through the application of graffiti to restore the property so defaced, damaged or destroyed. 
G.  Obtaining convictions for the application of graffiti is difficult due to the fact that the offense can be committed quickly and secretively, and that witnesses to the act are frequently nonexistent. 
H.  Members of the public should be encouraged, through the promise of a reward, to cooperate in the elimination of graffiti by reporting to the proper authorities any incidents of the application of graffiti which they observe.

A.  Green Alone or "Go." 
1.  Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn; but vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
2.  Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. 
B.  Steady Yellow Alone. 
1.  Vehicular traffic facing such a signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a steady red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter, and such vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection when a red signal is exhibited. 
2.  No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until the green or "Go" signal is shown alone, unless authorized so to do by a pedestrian "Walk" signal. 
C.  Steady Red Alone or "Stop." Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until green or "Go" is shown alone, unless a right turn is permitted on a steady "Red" or "Stop" signal and a proper signal, sign or light prohibits such right turn.

2.  No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until the green or "Go" is shown alone unless authorized so to do by a pedestrian "Walk" signal. 
E.  If an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal. 
F.  The ringing of a bell or whistle blast in connection with any official traffic signal shall indicate that a change is taking place or is to take place in the traffic signal; however, all traffic shall be required to obey the direction of the signal itself. The ringing of a bell or whistle blast is to be construed merely as a warning to traffic of a change in signal.

B.  No person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority permit upon any street or highway any traffic sign or signal bearing thereon any commercial advertising.

    "Snow emergency" means actual or forecasted weather conditions which require the absence of parked vehicles and other obstructions on snow routes to facilitate plowing and traffic flow. 
    "Snow routes" means those streets generally traversing the entire city or a major part thereof, and are considered essential to the rapid movement of emergency vehicles and normally carry the heaviest traffic volumes. 
    "Snow route priority" means a numerical system for ranking designated snow routes in two service levels: Primary and secondary access routes. 
(Ord. 1804, 1993: Ord. 1684, 1991.) (Ord. 2411, Amended, 10/13/2008) 
Section 10.50.020 - Declaration of snow emergency. 
A.  Whenever the director of public works finds, on the basis of falling snow, sleet or freezing rain, or on the basis of a forecast by the United States Weather Bureau or other meteorological data indicating the threat of snow, sleet or freezing rain, that weather conditions could severely impede vehicular traffic in the city, the director of public works shall declare a snow emergency. 
B.  A snow emergency shall automatically go into effect on any part of any snow route on which there has been an accumulation of snow or ice of six inches or more. 
C.  The public works director shall cause each declaration of a snow emergency to be publicly announced by means of broadcasts or telecasts from stations with a normal operating range covering the city, and may cause such declaration to be further announced in newspapers of general circulation when feasible. 
(Ord. 1684, 1991.) 
Section 10.50.030 - Parking on snow routes. 
A.  While a snow emergency is in effect, owners and operators of vehicles are encouraged not to park vehicles on snow routes and to remove any vehicle or other obstruction from a snow route. 
B.  Once in effect, a snow emergency under this section shall remain in effect until terminated by announcement of the director of public works, except that any street area which has become substantially clear of snow and ice from curb to curb for the length of the entire block shall be automatically excluded therefrom. 
(Ord. 1684, 1991.) 
Section 10.50.040 - Removal of vehicles. 
A.  During a snow emergency, a police officer or other government employee whose duty is to clear snow routes is authorized to order the immediate removal of any vehicle which is parked or disabled in a position which obstructs a travel lane or impedes the safe and expeditious clearing of snow on a snow route. If the owner or operator of such vehicle fails or refuses to comply immediately with such order, the vehicle may be immediately removed from the snow route to the nearest place where the vehicle will not obstruct a snow route. 
B.  The owner or operator of a vehicle removed from a snow route pursuant to this section shall be responsible for all costs incurred as a result of the removal of the vehicle.

Section 10.50.050 - Snow route priorities and route designations. 
A.  Due to the specialized equipment, logistics, timing and limited resources available for snow removal operations only certain city streets are designated as snow routes. To further improve our efficiency each snow route is assigned a snow removal priority. Snow removal priority classifications are established to guide city snow removal operations on designated streets as referenced on the City of Sparks snow route map. Maps are available at www.cityofsparks.us or the Public Works Department. Streets with the highest numerical priority shall have the first priority for service and on-going efforts will be maintained to keep higher priority streets open to the maximum extent possible. The following roadways are hereby established as snow routes and assigned a snow removal priority. 
1.  Priority 1 Roadways are designated as primary snow routes. This designation indicates that the roadway will be plowed to maintain continuous all-weather access within the maximum capabilities of the city. 
2.  Priority 2 Roadways are designated as secondary snow routes. This designation indicates that the road will be plowed to provide reasonable all-weather access as time, available funds and human resources permit. 
B.  All streets not referenced on the City of Sparks snow route map as Priority 1 or Priority 2 roadways included in section A are designated as non-snow routes. The City of Sparks snow removal operations are limited to Priority 1 or Priority 2 roadways referenced in section A, unless the public works director determines that emergency access or other special snow and ice conditions are present which require the utilization of city snow removal operations.

(a) All pollutants as total unless otherwise specified. 
(b) This limit is the total mass in pounds per day (lbs/day) that are available to allocate to all significant industrial users and other designated and permitted non-SIUs. The total combined lbs/day allocated in all permits issued cannot exceed this value for the given water reclamation facility. 
B.  The city may implement local limits through allocation of the maximum allowable industrial load (MAIL) to significant industrial users and specific permitted non-SIUs that correspond to the uniform concentration local limits shown in the table above. The MAILs listed in Table I-10 of the local limits report dated May 2, 2018, that correspond to the daily maximum discharge limits are hereby incorporated by reference. 
C.  A significant industrial user or other designated industrial user who introduces wastewater into the POTW may be required to submit a Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) Control Plan if monitoring of the industrial user's discharge shows it exceeds 1,200 mg/L TDS. This plan shall contain a description of the chemicals and materials used that contribute to the TDS concentration and the source control measures that could be implemented to reduce the TDS concentration in the discharge to less than 1,200 mg/L or to a level specified by the city that prevents discharges that cause or contribute to pass through or interference. 
D.  The following limits shall apply to wastewaters that are discharged from the groundwater cleanup of petroleum or gasoline underground storage tanks or other remediation wastewaters containing these pollutants or where these pollutants are appropriate surrogates. It shall be unlawful for any industrial user to discharge or cause to be discharged any waste or wastewater that exceeds the following limits, as applicable. 
Pollutant (a)(c) Daily Maximum Limit (mg/L) Benzene 0.050 BTEX (b) 0.750  
(a) All pollutants shown in the Table are total. 
(b) BTEX shall be measured as the sum of Benzene, Ethylbenzene, Toluene and Xylenes. 
(c) These limits are based upon installation of air stripping technology as described in the EPA document: "Model NPDES Permit for Discharges Resulting from the Cleanup of Gasoline Released from Underground Storage Tanks. June 1989."

Section 13.36.100 - Revision of wastewater regulations. 
    Effluent limitations promulgated by the Act, and regulations and guidelines promulgated thereunder, shall apply in any instance where they are more stringent than those in these regulations. 
    Limitations on wastewater strength in Section 13.36.090 of this title may be supplemented with more stringent limitations pursuant to Section 13.39.030 of this title: 
A.  If the public works director determines that the limitations in Section 13.36.090 of this chapter may not be sufficient to protect the operation of the city's treatment works; 
B.  If the public works director determines that the limitations in Section 13.36,090 of this chapter may not be sufficient to enable the city's treatment works to comply with water quality standards or effluent limitations specified in the city's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit; 
C.  If any matter of any nature may be discharged into the sewer system, which discharge might reasonably be considered a violation of this chapter, the controlling characteristic of such matter shall be determined to the satisfaction of the public works director. The responsibility of initiating such determinations of any costs involved and of submitting the results of the determination to the public works director for his approval lie solely with the party or parties desiring to discharge the matter into the sewer system. Verification of these results and the decision as to whether or not a permit shall be issued shall be the responsibility of the public works director. The adoption of this ordinance amending this title of the Code, or ordinances adopted subsequent hereto but without objection from the public works director, does not constitute a waiver of the public works director's right to regulate or prohibit the discharge of such matter.

Section 13.36.110 - Accidental discharge, spill, and slug discharge plans. 
A.  Users shall notify the public works director immediately upon becoming aware of an accidental discharge, spill, or slug discharge into the environment, sanitary or storm sewer systems in violation of this title. An accidental discharge, spill, or slug discharge, is defined in this title as any discharge of a non-routine, episodic nature, including but not limited to an accidental spill or a non-customary batch discharge of incompatible substances, regulated materials or wastewater into the environment, sanitary or storm sewer systems, which has a reasonable potential to cause interference or pass through, or in any other way violate the POTW's regulations, local limits or permit conditions. Notification shall enable the public works director to take proper measures to reduce the impact of the spill or discharge. This notification shall be followed by a detailed written statement within (5) five days of the date of occurrence. 
B.  The public works director shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action to control accidental discharges, spills, and slug discharges. The public works director may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan or take such other action that may be necessary to control slug discharges. Alternatively, the public works director may develop such a plan for any user. When the public works director deems it necessary, dischargers shall provide protection from an accidental discharge, spill, or slug discharge. This protection at a minimum shall consist of the following: 
1.  A written accidental discharge/spill/slug discharge plan containing operating procedures implemented to prevent an accidental spill/discharge. An accidental discharge/spill/slug discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
a.  Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges; 
b.  Description of stored chemicals; 
c.  Procedures for immediately notifying the public works director of any accidental discharge, spill, or slug discharge, as required by Section 13.36.110(A) of this title; and 
d.  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental discharge, spill, or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
2.  Control measures installed to prevent a spill/discharge into the POTW or environment. 
3.  Countermeasures to contain, cleanup and mitigate the effects of a spill/discharge. 
4.  Significant Industrial Users are required to notify the POTW immediately of any changes at its facility affecting potential for an accidental discharge, spill, or slug discharge. 
C.  Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this title; nor shall it relieve the user of any other responsibility or liability imposed by law. 
D.  When the public works director deems it necessary to reduce the risk of exposing the populace, environment, sanitary or storm sewer systems to incompatible substances, secondary containment shall be installed. The public works director may waive secondary containment requirements if a substance poses no hazard.

Section 13.36.140 - Categorical pretreatment standards. 
    Categorical industrial users must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471. 
A.  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the public works director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with Sections 13.36.140(E) and (F). 
B.  When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the public works director may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users. 
C.  The public works director shall calculate the equivalent mass-per-day limitations under Section 13.36.140(B) by multiplying the limits in the standard by the industrial user's average rate of production. This average rate of production shall be based not upon the designed production capacity but rather upon a reasonable measure of the industrial user's actual long-term daily production, such as the average daily production during a representative year. For new sources, actual production shall be estimated using projected production. 
D.  The public works director shall calculate the equivalent concentration limitations under Section 13.36.140(B) by dividing the mass limitations derived under Section 13.36.140(C) by the average daily flow rate of the industrial user's regulated process wastewater. This average daily flow rate shall be based upon a reasonable measure of the industrial user's actual long-term average flow rate, such as the average daily flow rate during the representative year. 
E.  When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an Industrial User may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the public works director. The city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in Sections 13.36.140E.1.a through 13.36.140E.1.e below. 
1.  To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user must: 
a.  Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit; 
b.  Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment; 
c.  Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions; 
d.  Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge; and 
e.  Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial user's request for equivalent mass limits. 
2.  An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must: 
a.  Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits; 
b.  Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device; 
c.  Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the public works director whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in Section 13.36.140E.1.c. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the public works director will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
d.  Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to Section 13.36.140E.1.a so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit. 
3.  When developing equivalent mass limits, the public works director: 
a.  Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the industrial user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor; 
b.  Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
c.  May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial user's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment. The industrial user must also be in compliance with Section 13.36.160 of this title regarding the prohibition of bypass. 
F.  The public works director may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users. The conversion is at the discretion of the public works director. 
G.  Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this Section 13.36.140 in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. 
H.  Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where such Standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation. 
I.  Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify the public works director within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the public works director of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate. 
J.  A user may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the following paragraphs of this section. 
1.  Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial user's intake water in accordance with this section. Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the city. Upon request of the industrial user, the applicable standard will be calculated on a "net" basis (i.e., adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the requirements of paragraph (2) of this subsection are met. 
2.  Criteria. 
a.  Either (i) The applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 CFR subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis; or (ii) the industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters. 
b.  Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the User's effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere. 
c.  Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standard(s), up to a maximum value equal to the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standard(s) adjusted under this section. 
d.  Credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the POTW discharges. The city may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result. 
K.  The public works director may develop best management practices (BMPs), in individual wastewater discharge permits, to implement Local Limits and the requirements of Section 13.36.010 of this title. 
(Ord. 2536, § 4, Amended, 06/26/2017; Ord. 2503, Add, 09/08/2014) 
Section 13.36.150 - Prohibition against dilution as a substitute for treatment. 
    Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement. The public works director may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(Ord. 2503, Add, 09/08/2014) 
Section 13.36.160 - Bypass provisions. 
A.  Definitions. 
1.  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of an Industrial User's treatment facility. 
2.  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
B.  Bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs C. and D. of this section. 
C.  Notice. 
1.  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the public works director, if possible at least ten days before the date of the bypass. 
2.  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the public works director within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The public works director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
D.  Prohibition of bypass. 
1.  Bypass is prohibited, and the public works director may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless; 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
c.  The industrial user submitted notices as required under paragraph C. of this section. 
2.  The public works director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the public works director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in Section 13.36.160D.1. 
(Ord. 2536, § 5, Amended, 06/26/2017; Ord. 2503, Add, 09/08/2014) 
Section 13.36.170 - Upset. 
A.  For the purposes of this section, upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
B.  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of Section 13.36.170C, below, are met. 
C.  A User who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
1.  An upset occurred and the User can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
2.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
3.  The user has submitted the following information to the public works director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset; if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
D.  In any enforcement proceeding, the User seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
E.  Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
F.  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

C.  Before a new Class II, Class III, Class IV, or Class V industrial/commercial discharger (as defined in Section 13.39.010 A of this title) to the city's wastewater facilities is allowed, the discharger must first obtain an environmental control permit from the public works director. All existing industrial/commercial dischargers must complete and submit to the public works director an application for wastewater inspection within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the application. Violation of this provision shall subject the discharger to enforcement and penalties as provided in Chapter 13.42 of this title. 
D.  Fees for environmental control permits and monitoring shall be set by resolution with a public hearing. Fees collected shall defray administrative, sample collection, testing, and other costs associated with environmental control permit applications and evaluations as required in Section 13.39.030 B of this chapter. Environmental control fees are set by resolution. 
E.  The public works director finds there is a need to recover costs incurred by the city, through a fee, in its code enforcement efforts. Fees charged include time spent by city personnel re-inspecting properties throughout the city in an effort to ensure compliance with the Code, and costs incurred in the re-inspection, investigation, recording of notices, and any other processing costs associated with violations specified on the notice of violation or a misdemeanor citation. Code enforcement fees shall be set by resolution with a public hearing. 
F.  Significant industrial users are required to notify the public works director immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. 
G.  Where possible, fees assessed pursuant to subsections D and E of this section will be placed on the dischargers' existing sewer account. Payments shall be due and payable upon receipt of the bill and shall be delinquent if not fully paid by the due date stated in the bill. A penalty of eight and three-tenths (8.3) percent per month of the charges may be added to all delinquent charges. 
H.  The public works director may deny or condition new or increased contributions of pollutants, or changes in the nature of pollutants, where such contributions do not meet applicable pretreatment standards and requirements or where such contributions would cause interference or pass-through.

Section 13.39.070 - Pretreatment of sewage. 
    The public works director may require users of the city's sewer system to pretreat wastewater. Users shall make wastewater acceptable under the limitations established in Chapter 13.36 of this title before discharging into any wastewater facility. 
A.  Upon written notice from the city of the requirement for pretreatment of discharge, the user shall have ten (10) working days to reply to the public works director as to a plan of compliance and shall be in compliance within ninety (90) days unless a time extension is granted by the city. 
B.  Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the public works director for review and shall be approved by the public works director before construction of the pretreatment facility. Such pretreatment plants shall be understood to include grease traps, chemical or biochemical treatment plants, sedimentation chambers and any other devices which effect a change of any nature in the characteristics of the matter being treated. 
C.  Any and all such devices and equipment shall not be put into operation without a written permit of approval issued by the public works director and shall be provided with all necessary features of construction to allow inspection of operations and testing of material passing through them, and shall be open to the inspection of the public works director at any time. 
D.  The public works director may require that industrial/commercial dischargers provide information proving that concentrations of constituents contained within their wastewater, but not regulated under Section 13.36.090, will not pass through the treatment works, interfere with the operation of the treatment works, limit disposal of municipal biosolids, present a fire or explosion hazard, cause structural damage to wastewater facilities or obstruct flow, or pose a threat to the health, safety and welfare of the workers. This information shall include supporting data and analysis and shall be prepared by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Nevada and experienced in sanitary design. 
E.  The user, in lieu of the treatment of the sewage as hereinabove provided for, may with the written approval of the public works director being first obtained, discharge the sewage, waste or other matter into the sewage system, subject to the provisions of Chapter 13.36 of this title, and subject to the payment of the additional cost of the treatment thereof, as provided for in this title. 
F.  Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the public works director shall be provided and maintained at the user's expense. 
G.  The review and approval of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent complying with the provisions of this title. 
H.  All analytical procedures used to determine compliance with pretreatment standards will be those specified in 40 CFR Part 136. 
I.  Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be approved by the public works director.

Section 13.39.080 - Monitoring equipment construction and report requirements. 
A.  Monitoring facilities and equipment. 
1.  Monitoring facilities and equipment may be required of any sewer user in order to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer, or internal drainage system. 
2.  When more than one sewer user can discharge into a common building sewer, the public works director may require installation of a separate monitoring facility for each user. Also when, in the judgment of the public works director, there is significant difference in wastewater constituents and characteristics produced by different operations of a single user, the public works director may require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each separate discharge. 
3.  Monitoring facilities that are required to be installed shall be constructed, operated and maintained at the user's expense. The purpose of the facility is to enable inspection, sampling and flow measurement of wastewaters produced by a user. 
4.  If sampling or metering equipment is also required by the public works director, it shall be provided, installed and operated at the user's expense. 
5.  The monitoring facility will normally be required to be located on the user's premises outside of the building. The public works director, however, may allow the monitoring facility to be constructed in the public street or public sidewalk area, when such a location would be required in order to enact a categorical pretreatment standard, or when a location on the user's premises as normally required is determined to be impractical, or cause undue hardship to the user. 
6.  If the monitoring facility is inside the user's fence, there shall be accommodations to allow safe and immediate access for city personnel, such as a gate secured with a city lock. There shall be ample room in or near such facility to allow accurate sampling and compositing of samples for analysis. The entire facility and the sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by and at the expense of the sewer user. 
7.  Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the city's requirements. 
8.  When, in the judgment of the public works director an existing user requires a monitoring facility, the user will be so notified in writing. 
9.  Construction must be completed within 90 days following written notification unless a time extension is otherwise granted by the public works director. 
B.  Monitoring reports. 
1.  Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable discharge limitations, or in case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the city sewer system, any commercial/industrial discharger subject to such discharge limitations shall submit to the public works director a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the affected commercial or industrial establishment. 
a.  The discharger's report will include reporting on the discharge from any regulated processes which are limited by the discharge limitations and the average and maximum daily flow from these process units in the user facility which are limited by such standards or discharge limitations. 
b.  The report shall state whether the applicable limitations are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, what additional operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the sewer user into compliance with the applicable limitations. 
c.  In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by public works director or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. 
d.  The submitted report will include the following certification signed by a duly authorized representative of the industrial user. "I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations." 
2.  Any user subject to a discharge limitation after the compliance date of such discharge limitation, or, in the case of a new source after commencement of the discharge into the city's sewage collection or treatment facilities, shall submit to the public works director during the months of July and January, unless required more frequently by the public works director, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such discharge limitations. 
a.  This report will include the following certification signed by a duly authorized representative of the industrial user. "I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations. 
b.  In addition, this report shall include a record of all daily flows which, during the reporting period, exceeded the average daily flow reported, as required under the permit. 
c.  At the discretion of the public works director, and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budgets and cycles, the public works director may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. 
d.  The public works director may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet applicable discharge limitations or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. In such cases, the report required by the above paragraphs shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by the discharge limitations in the effluent of the sewer user. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and nature of concentration, or production and mass, where requested by the public works director, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. 
e.  The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the environmental control permit. 
3.  Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard or the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the sanitary sewers shall submit a baseline monitoring report containing the information listed in 40 CFR 403.12(b). At least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge to the sanitary sewers, new sources subject to such categorical standards shall submit a baseline monitoring report containing the information listed in 40 CFR 403.12(b). A compliance schedule required as part of a baseline monitoring report shall meet the conditions of 40 CFR 403.12(c). 
4.  Industrial users shall notify in writing the public works director, and the hazardous waste authorities at the US Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Nevada, of any discharge into the sanitary sewers of any substance, which if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. This notification does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of Section 13.39.080(B)(1,2,3) of this title. 
5.  All industrial users shall promptly notify the public works director in advance of any substantial chances in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous waste for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under Section 13.39.080(B)(4). 
6.  If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the public works director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the public works director within 30 days after becoming aware of the violations. 
C.  Dischargers subject to federal reporting requirements shall maintain records of all information resulting from all monitoring activities. Such records shall be maintained in the dischargers' official business records for a minimum of three years and shall be made available for inspection and copying by the public works director. The required period of record retention may be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation between a discharger and the city or when requested by EPA or NDEP. Such records shall, at a minimum, outline the following: 
1.  Collection date; 
2.  Collection time; 
3.  Collection point/source; 
4.  Grab/composite sample; 
5.  Name of person(s) collecting the sample; 
6.  Sample preservation method(s); 
7.  Name of laboratory/person(s) performing the analysis; 
8.  Analytical techniques/methods used; 
9.  Testing for, and results of such analysis. 
D.  Except as indicated in subsections E and F below, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the public works director. 
1.  All sampling, including time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling if authorized by the city, must be representative of daily operations, of the conditions occurring during the reporting period, and of the discharge. 
2.  Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the public works director, as appropriate. 
3.  Grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
E.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
F.  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring reports: 
1.  A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist. 
2.  For facilities for which historical sampling data are available, public works director may authorize a lower minimum. 
G.  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and periodic compliance reports: 
1.  For the periodic monitoring reports established in Section 13.39.080 of this title, the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
2.  In cases where a pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the city to determine the compliance status of the user. 
3.  All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the public works director or other parties approved by EPA. 
4.  These reports must be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and in accordance with the techniques described in Part 136 and amendments, and include all monitoring results for the period covered by the report, including those from monitoring conducted more frequently than required. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the city in lieu of the user. 
H.  Users subject to the reporting requirements of this title shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this title, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with best management practices established under Section 13.36.140(I) of this title. 
1.  Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. 
2.  These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by public works director.

The director shall not review any appeal that has been filed with the City Clerk beyond ten (10) business days after the Respondent receives the hearing officer's decision. 
F.  Appeal to City Council. 
1.  If the director affirms the decision of the hearing officer, the Respondent may appeal the decision to the Sparks City Council.

The City Council shall reverse the decision of the Department director if the City Council finds that the decision was (i) made upon unlawful procedure, (ii) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record. 
G.  Civil Action in Justices' Court.

In making a finding that a water emergency condition exists or is likely to exist, the city council shall consider the following: 
1.  The amount of recorded precipitation during the preceding year in the area affected in relation to the normal precipitation recorded for such area; 
2.  The amount of water contained in any reservoir, storage basin (including without limitation any underground water supply basin), or other water supply facilities utilized by any public water system in the area affected in relation to the projected water use from such reservoir, storage basin, or other water supply facilities;

Such notice shall be a condition precedent to any violation of this subsection and shall be based on a finding by the Department director that the public health, safety and convenience requires such a restriction on such use of water because of limited water supplies. The city engineer may rely on representations from any public utility that supplies water to customers in making such a finding; 
3.  Use of water from fire hydrants for any purpose other than extinguishing fires; 
4.  Use of water for any outdoor decorative purpose;

The customer may elect to pay the connection fee in one (1) lump sum payment before effluent delivery or in monthly installments, amortized over a four-year period at a fixed interest rate of four and one-half (4.5) percent, one (1) month in arrears, due on the due date specified on the monthly bill. Effective January 1, 2011, connection fees shall be adjusted annually based on the Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index. The measurement period shall end with the published index for November of each year and the resulting increases shall be implemented January of each year. Calculation of the change in the index is made by dividing the current index for November by the preceding index for November and subtracting one (1). The applicant shall provide an estimate of annual water demand subject to city review and acceptance. Should the anticipated water usage change, the user must reapply for service at which time the connection fee will be reexamined. The city reserves the right to evaluate water use data to determine that the estimated annual demand is not being exceeded. The city may accept construction of facilities in lieu of a portion or the entire connection fee. If the reclaimed water service is part of the improvement for a subdivision or parcel map, then the fee shall be paid to the city prior to recordation of the final subdivision or parcel map, issuance of building permit, or initiation of work by the city. Otherwise, the fee shall be paid prior to approval of service. If a connection is made to the reclaimed water utility without city authorization and payment of connection fees, a connection fee will be charged twice the standard rate. 
C.  Customer shall be responsible for all service connection installations. Only city personnel will install meters. 
D.  The applicant under the terms of a main line extension agreement shall fund any main extension required for service, as provided in Section 13.85.080 of this chapter. 
E.  Enlargement of a service connection to the same property, requiring abandonment of the existing connection and installation of a complete replacement connection of increased size, shall be treated as a new service connection and shall be charged accordingly. The fee to be paid by the applicant is the connection fee which is determined by subtracting the connection fee for the size of service being abandoned from the connection fee for the size of service being installed.

Section 13.85.050 - Schedule of other rates and charges. 
A.  An existing service connection may be relocated, if the new service is of like size and will provide a reclaimed water supply to the same parcel of property, upon application and payment of the City's relocation costs by the applicant. 
B.  Should it become necessary to enforce discontinuance of service, to shut off the service at the main, a charge equal to the cost of labor, equipment and materials will be made. Said charge will be not less than $1,000. 
C.  If payment is not received by the due date of payment specified on the bill, a late payment processing fee on the outstanding balance and a handling fee will be charged in accordance with SMC Section 13.27.040 and the service may be discontinued. 
D.  Each customer shall have established the amount of annual demand in acre-feet of reclaimed water service they are requesting and a customer shall not exceed that amount. However, in the event a customer exceeds that amount for other than temporary emergency service, a customer shall pay additional connection fees each and every year any over-usage occurs, as set forth in section 040 of this chapter. Failure to pay the necessary additional connection fees shall result in the termination of service in accordance with section 090 of this chapter. In the event a customer does not use the established annual acre-feet demand consistently for at least five years, the City may consider a refund of a portion of the connection fees originally paid. 
E.  Temporary emergency service is any pre-approved service in excess of the established annual demand. The director may provide any customer with temporary emergency reclaimed water service when that customer makes application for such service and complies with all requirements of this ordinance and pays $1.84 per 1,000 gallons of use. 
F.  Customer will be billed at the City's cost for any customer-requested troubleshooting, maintenance, repair, inspections and diagnostic services. 
(Ord. 2390, Add, 02/25/2008) 
Section 13.85.060 - Billings and payments. 
A.  All metered services shall be billed monthly except for truck fills which are billed quarterly. All user charges resulting from water consumption incurred on truck fill cards shall be the responsibility of the owner stated in the application on file. 
B.  Customers are responsible for payment of all reclaimed water recorded as having passed through a meter, regardless of whether the reclaimed water was put to beneficial use. 
C.  The owner of the property is ultimately responsible for payment of reclaimed water bills and fees in the case of non-payment by a tenant. Until paid, all rates, tolls, charges and damages provided in this title institute a lien on and against the property served and may be foreclosed on as provided by law. 
D.  The City shall read the reclaimed water meters in the service area monthly, and as soon thereafter as practicable, issue a bill for each service in accordance with this Ordinance. The City shall send out bills for amounts due the City and for which no payment has been received, and shall use the rates and charges set forth in this Ordinance to determine the amount. 
E.  Upon presentation, all bills shall be due and payable at the office of the Director of Finance. 
F.  The City may discontinue service to a Customer having a delinquent bill. 
G.  Failure to receive a bill does not relieve the Customer of the obligation to pay for services received. 
H.  Checks presented in payment of bills that are returned by a bank shall be treated as though no payment was made and a $25 handling charge will be levied by the City. Redemption of returned checks may be required to be by cash or equivalent. 
I.  For the purpose of computing charges, each meter will be considered separately, and readings of multiple meters will not be combined, except where a battery of smaller meters has been installed in lieu of a larger one for the City's convenience. In such cases, charges will be computed as if the reclaimed water used has been measured through a single meter. 
J.  If a meter cannot be read because of obstructions or other causes, an estimate shall be made of the quantity of reclaimed water used, and a bill shall be issued for the estimated service. The next succeeding bill that is based upon actual meter readings will reflect the difference between prior estimates and actual consumption. If a meter is found to be non-operational, consumption shall be estimated and billed accordingly. 
K.  Where billing adjustments are processed for inaccurate meter recordings or other usage adjustment, if the meter has: 
1.  Under-recorded the usage of reclaimed water, the adjustment shall be only for the period of the most recent six (6) months of usage. 
2.  Over-recorded the usage, the adjustment shall be made only for the period of the most recent six (6) months of usage. 
(Ord. 2420, Amended, 01/26/2009; Ord. 2390, Add, 02/25/2008) 
Section 13.85.070 - Service. 
A.  The City of Sparks Reclaimed Water Treated Effluent Design & Performance Standards (Design & Performance Standards), together with all addendum, all of which are on deposit in the office of the City Clerk, are adopted by reference and incorporated herein and made a part hereof as if set forth in full. The Design & Performance Standards are intended to establish minimum standards for the design, construction and operation of effluent application systems to which this Ordinance applies. If applicable, the Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction (Orange Book) also apply. 
B.  The City reserves the right to determine the size of the service connection to be installed, giving consideration to the needs of the applicant and the capacity of the main to which the service is to be connected. 
C.  Interruptions 
1.  Emergency Interruptions. The City will make reasonable efforts to prevent interruptions to service and when such interruptions occur the City will endeavor to reestablish service without unreasonable delay. The City will not be liable for interruptions or shortage or insufficiency of supply or any loss or damage of any kind or character if caused by an act of God, fire, strike, riot, war, accident, breakdown, action by governmental agency, or other cause beyond the control of the City. 
2.  Scheduled Interruptions. Whenever the City finds it necessary to schedule an interruption to its service, it will, within twenty-four (24) hours, where feasible, notify all customers to be affected by the interruption, stating the approximate time and anticipated duration of the interruption. Scheduled interruptions will be made at such hours as will provide the least inconvenience to the customers, consistent with reasonable city operations. 
3.  Shortage Interruptions. During time of reclaimed water shortage, the City will make all reasonable efforts to apportion the available reclaimed water supply among its customers in order of seniority. 
D.  The quantity of reclaimed water is limited and the City recognizes a first in time priority program for the establishment of service. All existing and future reclaimed water use will be prioritized in order of seniority based on the date of application. 
E.  An application maintains its date of priority for so long as the applicant can establish, to the satisfaction of the City, proof and evidence of the applicant's reasonable diligence in placing the reclaimed effluent water to beneficial use. 
F.  Transitions from City owned facilities to privately owned facilities shall be clearly delineated on the design drawings. Typically, the meter at the point of connection serves as the point of transition, with the meter and facilities upstream of the meter being owned and maintained by the City, and facilities downstream of the meter being owned and maintained by the customer. In cases where mainlines exist within public right-of-way downstream of a meter (typically a "master" meter), the transition between City owned and maintained facilities and customer owned and maintained facilities shall be delineated by, and include an isolation valve and test station located as near as possible to the boundary (property line) between public right-of-way and private property. 
G.  The City may require backflow protection on a reclaimed water service connection. 
H.  All connections are subject to City inspection and testing at reasonable times. 
I.  Construction 
1.  Only contractors licensed by the State of Nevada and duly authorized to perform the work contemplated, after issuance of a permit, will be permitted to install or maintain a service connection. 
2.  The City shall be notified before any section of pipeline is buried to allow for inspection and positional GPS locating of the facilities. 
3.  The City will not permit shutting down of mains for the purpose of making connections where hot taps are acceptable. 
4.  Only contractors on the Truckee Meadows Water Authority-approved list of contractors will be permitted to perform hot taps. 
J.  A customer shall notify the City within 24 hours of any situation constituting a material violation of the City's Discharge Permit or Effluent Management Plan. 
(Ord. 2390, Add, 02/25/2008) 
Section 13.85.080 - Reclaimed water main extensions. 
A.  In cases where extension of the City's main is required to provide a reclaimed water supply to a subdivision or other parcel of property, the Customer may construct a mainline service pipe, at his own expense, from points of use to a point where connection can be made directly to the City's then-existing main. No main extensions shall be constructed to provide reclaimed water for single-family residential properties. 
B.  Standard Main Extensions 
1.  Main extensions constructed by persons for development of subdivisions or other property shall not be considered as reserved for supply to those properties exclusively. Extensions of and connections to such mains shall be permitted when, in the opinion of the City, such connections will not substantially affect supply to the original development or property. 
2.  The cost of all main extensions to be constructed under this section, including service laterals and other appurtenances, shall be borne by the Developer or Customer. 
3.  A person proposing an extension to the City reclaimed water distribution system shall submit an application and construction plans in accordance with section 020 of this chapter. 
4.  Reclaimed water mains and appurtenances shall be located within dedicated rights-of-way or within easement grants to the city not less than twenty (20) feet in width, or as the city may otherwise specify. All rights-of-way or easements shall be indicated on the construction plans submitted and recorded prior to release of approved plans. 
5.  The minimum size of any main to be constructed as part of the city's distribution system shall be four (4) inches in diameter. 
6.  Reclaimed water service will not be activated until the city accepts the construction. 
C.  Oversized main extensions. An oversize main extension proposed for construction under this section is subject to subsection B of this section and the city reserves the right to: 
1.  Determine its appropriate location; and 
2.  Enter into an agreement with the developer in which the city's participation in construction costs is set forth. 
D.  Participation by the city for the over-sizing of a main extension shall be based on the difference in actual cost of pipe, fittings, and valves between the size required for the main extensions and the size required for over-sizing. The cost difference shall be established by a certified price list from the supplier. Prices quoted on the list shall be the actual prices charged to the buyer. The city may, in lieu of a lump sum payment of the city's portion of the construction costs, arrange with the developer or customer for an alternate method of payment. 
(Ord. 2390, Add, 02/25/2008) 
Section 13.85.090 - Termination of service. 
A.  A customer may terminate service by giving not less than five (5) days advance notice to the city, and provide a mailing address to which the closing bill will be mailed. Failure to notify the city of termination of service shall not relieve the customer or property owner, if other than the customer, of responsibility for payment of reclaimed water bills. 
    The agreement for service shall terminate upon receipt of this request and any water allocated may be reallocated to other users or potential users. 
B.  The city may terminate service: 
1.  For nonpayment of a bill if the bill is not paid within ninety (90) calendar days after its due date, provided the city has given the customer at least thirty (30) days prior notice of such termination; and 
2.  For a customer's failure to comply with this chapter, or for any negligence, inter-connections, cross-connections, illegal connections, unsafe or damaging apparatus or fraudulent use of service.

Chapter 15.11 - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT 
Sections: 

Section 15.11.0010 - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the State of Nevada has in Nevada Revised Statutes 278.020, 244A.057, and 543.020 conferred upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the City of Sparks does hereby adopt the following floodplain management ordinance to regulate development within floodplains. 
(Ord. 1838, 1994: Ord. 1760, 1992.) (1886, Repealed & Replaced, 12/26/1995) 
Section 15.11.0020 - Finding of fact. 
    The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
    These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. 1838, 1994: Ord. 1760, 1992.) (1886, Repealed & Replaced, 12/26/1995) 
Section 15.11.0030 - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private loss due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
1.  protect human life and health; 
2.  minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
3.  minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
4.  minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
5.  minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazards; 
6.  help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; 
7.  ensure potential buyers are notified of property located in areas of special flood hazards; 
8.  ensure those who occupy the areas of special flood hazards assume responsibility for their actions; and 
9.  maintain qualifying standards for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(Ord. 1838, 1994: Ord. 1760, 1992.) (1886, Repealed & Replaced, 12/26/1995) 
Section 15.11.0040 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance includes methods and provisions to: 
1.  restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
2.  require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
3.  control the alteration of natural floodplains, alluvial fans, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
4.  control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
5.  prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. 1838, 1994: Ord. 1760, 1992.) (Ord. 2434, Amended, 12/14/2009; 1886, Repealed & Replaced, 12/26/1995)

The Administrator will not consider a LOMA if the information submitted is based on alteration of topography or new hydrologic or hydraulic conditions since the effective date of the FIRM. 
18.  "Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)" means the procedures by which contractors, developers, and communities can request changes to flood zones, floodplain and floodway delineations, flood elevations, and planimetric features based on the results of structural works, improvements, or annexations; resulting in additional flood hazard areas. 
19.  "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement.

23.  "Special flood hazard area" means an area having special flood, mudslide or flood-related erosion hazards, and shown on an FHBM or FIRM in Zones A, AO, A1, A30, AE, A99, AH, E or M. 
24.  "Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

Project Costs will then be allocated to the Assessed Properties (as a group) in the percentage of the benefit to the Development and to the City in the percentage of the benefit to the public. The amount of costs allocated to the Assessed Property as a group will be divided and assessed against individual properties as provided in Section 17.033.070 below. 
B.  For Landscaping Projects. 
1.  Landscaping Projects along interior streets of Developments are presumed to benefit the Development 100% and the public 0%. This presumption contemplates that the enhanced land values and pedestrian safety benefits inure only to residents in the Development and their invitees. 
2.  Landscaping Projects along arterial streets and major thoroughfares are presumed to benefit the Development 100% and the public 0%. This presumption contemplates that the enhanced land values and pedestrian safety benefits inure only to residents in the Development and their invitees. However, the Parks Director may determine that some benefit inures to persons outside the Development if the Landscaping Project includes a sidewalk that connects other developments with commercial facilities, in which case the Parks Director may increase allocations to other developments in the same District, or to the City based on expected pedestrian use along the Development frontage. 
C.  For Public Lighting Projects. 
1.  All public lighting projects are presumed to benefit the Development 100% and the public 0%. This presumption contemplates that the security and safety benefits inure only to the properties within the illumination sphere of the lights If, however, the Public Lighting Project is part of a Landscaping Project which is determined to benefit persons other than those in the Development as provided in Subparagraph B.2 above, similar allocations may be made for public lighting. 
D.  For Security Walls 
1.  All Security Wall Projects are presumed to benefit the Development 100% and the public 0%. This presumption contemplates that the security and sound protective benefits of the walls inure only to the residences within the Development. 
E.  For trails, parks and open space 
1.  Trail projects described in NRS 278.4787. 5 (trails listed in the recreation plan) shall be presumed to benefit the Development and the Public as follows. The hardscape and benches shall be presumed to benefit the public and shall be paid and the costs of maintaining them shall be borne by the city. This presumption is based on the regional nature of the trails. The landscaping shall be presumed to benefit the Development and the costs of maintaining it shall be allocated to the Assessed Properties. This presumption is based on the fact that the landscaping provides an asthetic buffer between the Development and the trail, and provides a greenbelt for the Development. 
2.  Parks, open space and nonregional trails. Trail, park and open space Projects shall not be included in Maintenance Districts unless they provide a substantial public benefit or are required by the City for the primary use of the public. All of the playgrounds, tot lots, and basketball courts shall be presumed to benefit the Development and all the costs shall be allocated to the Assessed Properties. This presumption is based on the fact such facilities are positioned for the benefit of and are used primarily by children within walking distance. All of the landscaping, Bar B Que and picnic facilities are presumed to benefit the public and the costs shall be allocated to the city. This presumption is based on the fact that these facilities attract and benefit a broader range of people who will travel a greater distance.

D.  Payment of Project Costs. The City shall pay its proportionate share of the Project Costs, and shall levy assessments against the Assessed Property as provided in the Regulations. 
E.  Assessment Liens. Once the Assessment Roll is mailed, assessments shall constitute a lien upon the Assessed Property. The lien attaches on July 1 of each year for which the assessment is levied. The lien must be executed, and has the same priority, as a lien for property taxes of as otherwise provided by Nevada law. The lien shall be a perpetual lien against the Assessed Property until the assessment and any penalty charges and interest which may accrue thereon has been paid in full. The Regulations shall establish procedures for collection of assessments and enforcement of liens. 
F  Penalties for nonpayment. If any person fails to pay an assessment when due, a penalty shall be imposed in the amount specified in the Regulaltions. 
G.  Waiver of all or part of interest and penalty for late payment of assessments. If the Finance Director finds that a person's failure to make a timely return or payment of assessments is the result of circumstances beyond his control and occurred despite the exercise of ordinary care, the Finance Director may relieve him of all or part of any interest or penalty, or both. A person seeking this relief must file a statement under oath setting forth the facts upon which he bases his claim with the Finance Director. The Finance Director shall disclose, upon the request of any person the name of the person and the amount of the relief.

**Alley loaded garages may be constructed within the rear setback and may utilize up to a four foot drive apron, whereas alley loaded driveway are prohibited.  
  
D.  Design Standards. 
    Purpose: These design standards maximize flexibility in the design of residential lots and encourage a variety of product types, while protecting of the community and its environmental resources. These standards encourage well-designed developments that: (1) reduce the prominence of garages in the front elevation, (2) promote pedestrian activity, (3) create functional and visual diversity, (4) provide community open space; and (5) protect significant features of the natural environment. 
1.  Generally. 
a.  New subdivisions that comply with these design standards are subject to the density standards, and not the minimum lot size and coverage requirements of this district (see subsection C above). 
b.  The City's review of a single-family residential project will consider the following criteria: 
(1)  Proportional size, mix and arrangement of lots; 
(2)  Placement of dwelling unit on lot; 
(3)  Varied garage placement and orientation; 
(4)  Provisions of amenities (entrance treatment, landscaping, open space, etc.); 
(5)  Preservation of natural features; 
(6)  Treatment of grading drainage courses, and; 
(7)  Treatment of walls. 
2.  Site Planning Standards. 
Purpose: These standards ensure that the relationship of units to each other and to other on-site uses are functional, attractive and create visual variety along the project's streets. Variation of development patterns within sub-divisions achieves visual diversity and avoids the appearance of monotonous development. 
a.  Applicability. This subsection provides examples to the internal organization of a new residential development. Other alternatives which comply with the dimensional standards will be considered. 
b.  Orientation. 
_____Varied
Garage
Placements
and
Orientation Where SMC permits, garages can be entered from the front or side of the structure. _____Traditional
Design
with Alley The use of public alleys in a subdivision will place the garage and vehicular traffic access off the alley and not the front of the home. Alley-loaded garages may utilize drive aprons whereas alley-loaded driveways are prohibited. _____Combined
Front and
Rear
Setbacks The combined front and rear setback requirements otherwise required for a conventional development are combined. The development may reduce the front and rear setback, but the combined total front and rear setback is equal to the conventional development. This allows a variety of setback combinations. If this option is used, setbacks cannot be reduced below the following minimums:  Front: 7.5 feet  Rear: 15 feet A 20-foot driveway length is required for a garage to accommodate required off-street parking. Therefore, a garage may not utilize the specific flexibility reduction in setbacks as depicted above. Alley loaded garages are exempt from this flexibility as the garage is permitted to be at the rear property line. The example below shows this option as applied to the SF6 district. Conventional development in SF-6 requires a 15' front and 20' rear setback, for a total of 35'. This option can use any combination of front or rear setbacks so long as (1) the total setbacks equal 35' and (2) the minimum setbacks above are incorporated.  

Rear Yard
Garages Garages may be placed in the rear of the lot. A second-story living unit over the garage is allowed per SMC to include an office (home occupation permit is required). The square footage of the second-story unit shall not exceed 35% of the primary structure foot print or 800 square feet, whatever is less. The width of the rear garage shall not exceed of 40% of the average lot width.  

3.  Architectural Standards. 
a.  Building Design. 
(1)  There is no specific architectural "style" required for residential structures. Within a development, the architecture shall include building style, form, size, color, materials and roof line that are complementary. Attached or detached garages or carports shall match the main structure in architecture, building material and roof pitch. 

Example of roof and wall articulation, a mix of materials and architectural details. 
(2)  Any building addition or additional building(s) (over 200 square feet) on a property shall match the main structure in building design, building materials, roof pitch and architectural character. 
(3)  At least three distinctive floor plans are required within each subdivision. A subdivision with 20 or less lots may have less than three distinctive floor plans, upon approval of the Administrator. 
(4)  The architectural character (i.e., exterior materials, window trims, cornices, arches, etc.) of the front elevations shall be utilized on all sides of the home. 
(5)  Roofs shall have variations in plane accomplished by use of dormers (pitched, shed-roof or eyebrow), gables, hipped roofs and variations in pitch. Pitched roofs are preferred and when a flat roof is used, it must relate to the architectural style as approved by the Administrator. All roofs shall be articulated. This may be achieved by changes in plane or by the use of traditional roof forms such as hips, gables, and dormers. 
(6)  In order to encourage front porches as a dominant feature for the street facade, and the connectivity of this space into the street neighborhood, front porches shall be allowed to encroach into the front yard setback five feet; 
(a)  The roof of the porch shall be solid. 
(b)  The porch shall be a minimum of 36 square feet with a minimum dimension of four feet in width. 
b.  Building Materials. 
(1)  Exterior elevation shall demonstrate a logical use of materials and a unified appearance. The design between the home and the garage shall use complementary materials and/or colors. The materials shall be architecturally related. Large expanses of uninterrupted, single exterior materials without window trim, plane or color changes shall not be allowed. 

Example of house with balance in design between house/porch and garage. 
(2)  Change of materials or color shall occur at changes in plane or at a logical break on that facade, so as not to give the appearance of "tacked-on" quality. Accent colors can be used for shutters, trim, balcony rail, columns, stucco recesses, or cornice bands and shall relate to the architectural character of the building. Accent materials utilized on the front façade corners shall extend and continue around the corners a minimum of 2 feet or a logical break on side facade. 
(3)  Building materials and color schemes shall be consistent with the chosen architectural style. For example, with Spanish style homes, the design is consistent with stucco buildings and mission tile roof. 
(4)  Exterior color elevations for all sides with proposed materials shall be provided for review and consideration by the Administrator prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
c.  Garage Frontage and Location. The intent of the garage standards are to ensure that the garage is not the dominant feature of the street façade. 
(1)  Street Loading Garages. To prevent the design of street loading garages as a dominant front visual street element of the building facade, houses with street loading garages shall not exceed 60% of the total overall length of the street building facade, and shall incorporate at least a two-foot offset as part of the front facade. 
(2)  Side Loading Garages. To prevent the side of the garage towards the street from being a blank wall, houses with side loading garages shall incorporate architectural features, windows, faux windows, or other details on the facade of the garage facing the street. 
(3)  Alley Loading Garages. To ensure compatibility, the garage off the alley shall have architectural features that complement the main structure and shall be oriented so as to not block they alley. 

Example of alley loaded garages that are architecturally compatible with the main structure. 
(4)  Driveway Length. The length of a driveway to the front of a garage door shall be a minimum of twenty (20) feet. The driveway length shall be designed to prevent an automobile parked in the driveway from blocking the sidewalk and to accommodate off street parking per SMC. 
(Ord. 2512, § 1(Exh. A), Add. 08/24/2015) 
Section 20.02.005 - Residential multi-family districts (MF). 
    Purpose: The MF districts accommodate a range of housing types, typically near activity centers. These districts allow higher residential densities, and are accompanied by recreational facilities, pocket parks or other amenities. Lower density MF districts (MF2 and MF3) buffer single-family neighborhoods from higher density residential, commercial, or mixed-use areas, while the higher density categories (MF4 and MF5) transition from multi-family to commercial. Residences should be sited to provide privacy to occupants while providing connectivity to adjoining commercial or other uses.

C.  Design Standards. 
    Purpose: These design standards maximize flexibility in the design of multi-family residential developments and encourage a variety of product types, while protecting the community and its environmental resources. These standards encourage well-designed developments that: (1) provide high quality front elevations, (2) promote pedestrian activity, (3) create functional and visual diversity, (4) provide community open space; and (5) protect significant features of the natural environment. The intent of these design standards is to allow maximum flexibility in the design of multi-family housing or attached single-family (such as condominiums and townhomes) and to encourage a variety of product types, while protecting the aesthetic value of the community, both the built and natural environments. 
1.  Site Planning Standards. 
a.  Site Character. 
(1)  Natural site features shall be preserved and become part of the new project, whenever feasible. The applicant shall replace natural features that are removed with similar feature of same or greater visual or ecological value. 
(2)  Natural features such as mature trees, creeks, riparian corridors and similar features unique to the site shall be preserved and incorporated into development proposals. 
b.  Building Orientation. 
(1)  Buildings shall be generally oriented with varying setbacks to provide visual interest and varying shadow patterns. 

(2)  Buildings shall be oriented in such a way as to create courtyards and open space areas. Clustering of multi-family units shall be consistently planned throughout the development. 
(3)  To provide indoor privacy between living spaces, there should be distance separations, buffering or changes in the angle of units. Private outdoor space shall be designed with maximum consideration for privacy, such as separations and orientation of the outdoor space. Building orientation shall provide opportunities for public spaces, for recreation and general open space. Public spaces shall be accessible to the majority of the surrounding units. The common area shall be useable areas and not steep slopes or riparian areas. 
2.  Parking and Circulation. 
a.  Entry Driveways shall include two of the following: 
I.  Monuments; 
II.  Pavers; 
III.  Stamped concrete; 
IV.  Landscaping; 
V.  Decorative paving; or 
VI.  Any similar material approved by the Administrator. 
Entry drives shall have a sidewalk on both sides. 
b.  Parking. 
(1)  Parking spaces include carports, garages or surface parking. 
(2)  Carports and garages shall be designed as an integral part of the architecture of the development. They shall be similar in materials, color and detail to the principal buildings of the development. Carports shall be designed to complement the architecture of the main buildings. 

Example of a well-designed carport 
c.  Pedestrian Circulation. 
(1)  All multi-family/attached single-family developments shall incorporate pedestrian connections to adjoining residential, recreational and commercial uses. 
(2)  Sidewalks along public streets shall have a minimum width of four feet. 
(3)  The parking area shall be designed in a manner which links it to the building and sidewalk network as an extension of the pedestrian system. The pedestrian system shall be designed within the development to connect the buildings and open space/recreational facilities. This can be accomplished by using design features such as walkways with enhanced paving, trellis structures and/or landscaping treatment. 
(4)  For projects along transit routes, they shall be designed to have a pedestrian entrance oriented towards transit stop(s) for convenient access. 
3.  Community Amenities. 
a.  Multi-family/attached single-family developments shall have useable community amenities, whether common or private, for recreation and social activities. 
b.  Developments with less than 100 units shall choose at least three of the following recreational facilities. Developments with at least 100 units shall choose six of the following recreational facilities: 
 swimming pool 
 tennis courts 
 horseshoes 
 spa

(2)  Connected to residential buildings by sidewalks, trails, or open space. 
d.  All living units shall have a private open space (i.e., decks or patios) and shall be contiguous to the units with a minimum of 25 square feet. 
4.  Building Architecture. 
a.  Building Design. 
(1)  There is no specific architectural "style" required for multi-family residential structures. Within a development, the architecture shall include building style, form, size, color, material and roof lines that are complementary. 
(2)  In order to avoid boxy and monotonous facades that lack a sense of human scale, buildings shall incorporate articulation with no flat wall planes, exceeding 50 feet vertically or horizontally, unless approved by the Administrator. 
(3)  The following standards apply: 
(a)  The architectural character (i.e., exterior materials, window trims, cornices, arches, etc.) of the exterior elevations shall be consistent on all sides of the building(s) that are visible from a public right of way. 
(b)  Roofs shall have variations in plane accomplished by changes in plane or by the use of traditional roof forms such as dormers (pitched, shed-roof or eyebrow), gables, hipped roofs and variations in pitch. When a flat roof is used, it must relate to the architectural style as approved by the Administrator. 
(c)  Stairs shall be compatible with the architecture of the buildings and integrated into the design of the building. 
(d)  Access points to units shall be clustered. Use of distinctive architectural elements and materials shall be used to denote entrances.

Section 20.02.006 - Mixed-use districts (MU-C, MR, DT/VS, RN). 
    Purpose: These districts provide a mix of uses, including high-density residential. The district allows vertical and/or horizontal mixing of uses on sites. The regulations create mix of uses with an efficient and compact development pattern that encourages shared parking and economical use of land. Higher density and intensity is transitioned away from established neighborhoods. 

*Note: Zoning within the Mixed-Use District is subject change and should be verified with the City of Sparks Zoning Map. 
    These standards support the preferred and anticipated character of each district, as follows: 
Mixed-Use 
Commercial 
(MU-C) This district primarily coincides with designated activity centers and should contain a mix of integrated, pedestrian-friendly uses (such as retail, offices, and residential.) The development and design standards emphasize pedestrian comfort and safety and include direct pedestrian and bicycle linkages to adjacent neighborhoods. Mixed-Use Commercial areas should contain a mix of integrated, pedestrian-friendly uses, such as outdoor restaurants and plazas and walkable retail streets. Properties with an Employment designation shall utilize the MU-C standards. _____Mixed 
Residential 
(MR) This district includes mixed-use development with a residential emphasis where site size, visibility, or access constraints may limit the feasibility of a concentrated activity center (such as in between activity center nodes) or where existing multi-family neighborhoods exist. The regulations encourage a broad mix of housing types and connections to surrounding neighborhoods and activity centers. These areas are oriented and provide direct access to adjacent transit corridors, adjacent neighborhoods, and activity centers. _____Downtown / 
Victoria Square 
(DT/VS) This district includes a range of retail, employment, casino, civic, and entertainment uses along with a variety of medium to high-density housing types. Retail and commercial uses should be concentrated at the street level within Downtown Sparks Center, along Victorian Avenue, and in other locations where a high level of activity is desirable. Residential and office uses are generally concentrated above retail uses. The Downtown Sparks Center is part of the DT/VS designation. _____Residential 
Neighborhood 
(RN) This district applies to established neighborhoods that will evolve to include a mix of single and multi-family housing types over time. Each neighborhood typically maintains a consistent architectural style and scale. While these neighborhoods are generally stable, targeted infill and redevelopment activity is expected to occur in some locations over time. Infill, redevelopment, and major renovations/additions should be consistent with the established character and scale of the neighborhood. _____

C.  Design Standards 
Purpose: 
  Protect stable residential neighborhoods in the Mixed-Use Districts; 
  Enhance the appearance of streets within the Mixed-Use Districts; 
  Distinguish the character of service-oriented or utilitarian streets from areas where higher levels of pedestrian activity are desirable; 
  Minimize the visual impacts of parking and maintain a pedestrian-friendly environment at the street edge; 
  To ensure that infill and redevelopment are compatible with the established character of the historic neighborhoods; 
  Reduce infill and redevelopment barriers by allowing for more compact parking configurations that maximize the efficiency of on-site parking and increases buildable areas; 
  Provide a continuous and easily accessible pedestrian circulation network; 
  Provide an on-site pedestrian network providing direct access to transit and the corridor-wide pedestrian circulation network; 
  Maintain a well-defined pattern of urban blocks that provide frequent pedestrian connections to adjacent neighborhoods and serve as a framework for a varied mix of uses; and 
  Ensure that activity centers are integrated with, rather than walled-off from adjacent neighborhoods. 
1.  Applicability. 
a.  An addition or renovation project proposed in a mixed-use district where the total square footage of the proposed addition is less than 50 percent of the total square footage of the existing primary structure is subject to parking requirements in Chapter 20.04, and is not eligible for the incentives provided in this Section. 
b.  Publicly-owned lands within the Downtown Redevelopment Area are governed by the Redevelopment Plan and design guidelines prepared by the Redevelopment Agency rather than this Section. 
c.  Routine Improvements. These regulations do not apply to: 
(1)  The renovation of an existing single-family home; or 
(2)  The routine maintenance and repair of a structure or other feature on the site, such as roof replacement or general repairs to a parking area or other site feature. 
2.  Street Classifications. For purposes of applying these standards, the mixed-use districts are divided into "primary" streets and "secondary" streets, as follows: 
"Primary" 
Streets This is a street with frontage that is restricted to building types and uses that promote pedestrian activity, and which benefit from pedestrian and/or transit access. Prater Way, Victorian Avenue and the portion of Lincoln Way between Sparks Blvd. and McCarran Blvd. are designated as "Primary" Streets. "Secondary" 
Streets A street that accommodates a variety of building and site design categories, including service, loading, and parking frontages. This may include large floor plate commercial uses or uses with front loaded parking for which there is a current market demand, but that may be redeveloped or augmented in the future as transit service increases and market demand shifts. A "Secondary" designation may be considered an interim designation as part of a phased development plan.  
3.  Transitional Standards. 
Purpose: This section provides for a smooth and compatible transition between intensive, mixed-use or non-residential development and established residential neighborhoods. 
a.  Applicability. This section applies to any non-residential or multi-family development in the MU-C, MR, or DT/VS district that adjoins a residential single-family district. 
b.  Standards. Developments shall include at least one of the following transitional standards 
(1)  Locate smaller-scale residential uses (e.g., townhomes) along the shared boundary of the development and the adjacent single-family district to promote a more seamless transition between uses; 
(2)  Cluster taller structures (e.g., five stories or more) away from the primary street frontage and the adjacent neighborhood (e.g., at the center of the site); 
(3)  Step down the height of structures as they approach the edges of the single-family district; and 
(4)  Maintain or establish direct vehicular and pedestrian access points to the surrounding neighborhood and adjacent non-residential uses. 
4.  Site Design. 
a.  The following standards apply to site design within the MU-C, MR, DT/VS, and RN districts: 
Primary Streets Secondary

Use one of the following options: The primary building entrance is located at the sidewalk edge and faces the street The primary building entry is located on a walkway or breezeway that is directly connected to the sidewalk (does not require walking around the building) The primary building entry faces a public plaza that is oriented towards the street M M (7) Required Pedestrian Connections Between Properties To support an interconnected pedestrian system, connections shall be provided to the following types of off-site pedestrian amenities: A  Sidewalks or walkways near the property line B  Adjacent transit stops C  Adjacent residential areas D  Adjacent parks, open spaces or trail systems E  Adjacent civic uses  
  
b.  The Administrator may approve alternative streetscape configurations and widths where the above configurations are not feasible. For example, existing development patterns and lot depths along some portions of Prater Way would limit sidewalk widths. 
5.  Landscaping. 
Purpose: This subsection emphasizes the use of landscaping at the street edge to: 
  Provide visibility and needed shade; 
  To enhance the pedestrian environment from a safety and transit supportive perspective; 
  To promote a more compact, urban pattern of development along the city's major urban corridors; and 
  To provide an incentive for infill and redevelopment. 
a.  The minimum portion of the site area to be landscaped is as follows: 
Minimum Landscaped Area Land Use Category "Primary" Streets "Secondary" Streets >Mixed-Use Commercial (MU-C) 10% 15% Mixed Residential (MR) 10% 15% Downtown/Victoria Square (DT/VS) 10% 10% Residential Neighborhood (RN) 10% 20%  
  
b.  Landscape standards are defined in Chapter 20.04, unless otherwise specified in this chapter. In the case of a landscaping ordinance conflict, the MUD landscaping standard prevails. 
c.  The applicant may credit the following areas towards the minimum landscape requirements for "Primary" Streets above: 
 Required street trees; 
 Areas within the Street/Furniture Zone that are occupied by street furniture and 
 Areas subject to the Streetscape and the Community Amenities requirements below.

K.  Avoiding Demolition Through Owner Neglect. Any structure or historic resource listed on the Sparks Register of Historic Places or within an established historic district shall be preserved against decay and deterioration and free from certain structural defects. Such structures shall be preserved and maintained by their owners in conformity with the requirements of this section and any standards adopted by the HRC or City Council. 
L.  Minimum Maintenance of Historic Properties. 
1.  The degree of maintenance and repair hereby required is that degree sufficient to prevent damage to a building's structural components and/or to its exterior that would cause the collapse of the structure or that would cause the building to become so deteriorated as to prevent its repair and preservation for resources listed on the Sparks Register of Historic Places. Acts which the owner may be required to perform pursuant to this section may include but are not limited to the following: securing the building or structure by boarding up doors and windows; and stabilizing walls, roofs and other parts of the building or structure. 
2.  All owners of structures designated as historic properties shall maintain their structures in conformity with the following minimum standards: 
a.  All structures shall be maintained in good general repair. 
b.  Structural Elements. 
(1)  All foundations shall support the structures and all points that provide for the structural integrity of the building shall be free of holes, wide cracks and buckling. 
(2)  Exterior walls, trim and roofs shall be free of holes, wide cracks and loose, warped, protruding or rotting boards or any other condition which might admit moisture or other elements. 
(3)  Masonry joints shall be maintained. 
(4)  Exterior surfaces exposed to the weather shall be repaired and painted to protect them from further deterioration. 
c.  Windows, exterior doors, bullheads, walls, and wood siding shall be watertight. 
d.  Flashing, Gutters and Ventilation. 
(1)  Exterior flashing, including those at chimneys, doors and windows, shall be maintained in good repair. 
(2)  Down spouts and gutters shall be maintained so that rain runoff is directed away from the structure. 
(3)  Foundation and attic vents shall be maintained to ventilate the crawl and attic spaces. 
e.  Outside stairways, porches and appurtenances to stairways and porches shall be maintained in good repair. 
f.  Unoccupied buildings shall be secured from intrusion and all utilities shall be properly maintained. 
g.  Existing structures shall be protected during construction or renovation in a manner that assures no damage by weather to interior spaces or structural components. 
h.  Any maintenance of trees designated as historic must be approved in advance by the City's Urban Forester or their designee. 
M.  Emergency Demolition Permit. 
1.  A request for a demolition permit involving a resource listed on the Sparks Register of Historic Places that has been subject to a catastrophic event, as defined in this article, shall be submitted in writing to the Community Development Department and shall include the property owner's authorization for submittal. In a situation where a resource must be demolished, the reuse of façade materials from the demolished resource is encouraged in the new structure as an effort to maintain the character of the original resource and the site's designation on the City register of historic places. 
2.  On a case-by-case evaluation and upon consultation with the chairman and vice chairman of the HRC, HRC staff and the city Building Official, without a public meeting, may issue a permit for a complete or partial demolition of a historic resource that is listed on the Sparks Register of Historic Places, if it is determined that the catastrophic event has rendered said resource immediately hazardous and dangerous and/or detrimental to the public health and/or safety as defined in the latest adopted Building Code. Prior to approval for demolition, it shall be determined that the structure cannot be stabilized and secured for additional analysis. 
3.  In determining the appropriateness of demolishing a resource under this emergency provision, HRC staff and the city Building Official shall give consideration to demolishing only those portions of a resource that are immediately hazardous, thereby allowing for the preservation/reconstruction of non-hazardous portions. HRC staff shall also consider whether the damage to the resource is so substantial that it alters the historic character of the resource. 
N.  Non-emergency Demolition Permit. 
1.  When HRC staff receives a request for non-emergency demolition of a resource listed on the Sparks Register of Historic Places, HRC staff shall perform a preliminary assessment to determine if the resource is significant. HRC staff may employ a registered historian to help make this determination. If the site is determined not to be significant, the demolition permit will be considered at HRC staff level after appropriate review has been noticed and issued and photo documentation to the city's satisfaction has been performed. If the historic resource is determined to be significant or if HRC staff's decision to approve the demolition permit is appealed, an application for a non-emergency demolition permit shall be submitted in writing to the community development department using forms provided by the city. In a situation where a resource must be demolished, the reuse of façade materials from the demolished resource is encouraged in the new structure as an effort to maintain the character of the original resource and the site's designation on the City register of historic places. 
2.  The HRC shall hold a duly noticed public meeting prior to the demolition of a significant historic resource. The applicant shall provide, at a minimum, the following items to the satisfaction of HRC staff: 
a.  Advertisement of the resource's availability for sale in at least one local newspaper and for a minimum period of two weeks; 
b.  Research into the feasibility of relocating a significant resource within the community including a licensed contractor's bid for the cost of moving the resource. For structures, the research shall include the cost of improving the structure to meet relevant building code standards; 
3.  The HRC may approve a demolition request upon making findings a, b, and c, and either d or e: 
a.  That the Sparks Register of Historic Places is not diminished by the demolition of the subject resource, and that there remains in the community a like resource, (i.e., use, site, architectural style, or example of an architect's work); 
b.  That all feasible physical alternatives to demolition have been evaluated, and that the applicant has shown that there is no alternative left to pursue, other than demolition; 
c.  That the continued existence of the historical resource is detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare; 
d.  If the property is approved for demolition, the Nevada Historical Society, Sparks Heritage Museum and/or other appropriate historic agency has access to the building to retrieve any historic material, and to provide photo documentation of the resources conducted according to Historic American Building Survey (HABS) specifications; 
e.  The applicant shall have, or will have a plot plan or development plan approved by the City prior to issuance of a demolition permit. 
4.  No later than ten (10) working days following the HRC action, the decision of the HRC shall be filed with the clerk of the HRC and a notice thereof shall be mailed to the applicant at the address shown on the application. 
O.  HRC Recommendation on Conditional Use Permits, Administrative Reviews Variances and Rezoning Requests. All conditional use permits, administrative reviews, variances, and rezoning requests for historic resources listed on the Sparks Register of Historic Places shall obtain a recommendation of approval from the HRC prior to filing an application and being reviewed by Planning Commission or City Council. HRC shall review each request with the criteria in subsection A. 
(Ord. 2512, § 1(Exh. A), Add. 08/24/2015) 
Section 20.02.012 - Planned development. 
    Purpose: This chapter provides for maximum environmental choice for the citizens of the City of Sparks by encouraging flexibility and creativity of design and a greater diversity of building types, open space arrangements and other aspects of land planning while, at the same time, preserving public welfare, health, and the general intent of the Master Plan. An additional purpose of this chapter is to provide a degree of certainty for the duration of build out of a large tract of land, such certainty not otherwise available in other chapters of this Title. 
A.  Minimum Site. 
1.  The minimum site area is five acres. 
2.  The City Council may waive this minimum if the proposal furthers the City's adopted redevelopment plan. 
B.  Requirements for all Planned Development Reviews. 
1.  Permitted uses. A planned unit development may include any uses permitted in any zone classification provided that any combination of uses is planned in a manner compatible to each and to the surrounding environment. 
2.  Density. The allowable density for a planned unit development shall be within the range established in the City of Sparks' Adopted Master Plan for Growth Management. Factors to be considered in assigning density are: 
a.  Site analysis; 
b.  Topography; 
c.  Drainage ways; 
d.  Views; 
e.  Soils; 
f.  Layout of lots; 
g.  site sectional studies. 
3.  Common open space. 
a.  Subject to the limitations of this section, all developments must provide for a minimum of 20 percent common open space. 
b.  Irrespective of its size, no golf course may contribute more than one-quarter of the common open space required by this section. 
c.  The common open space required by this section may be reduced by one quarter if it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the common open space is: 
(1)  Landscaped, in a manner which exceeds the minimum standards imposed in Chapter 20.04; 
(2)  Is interconnected with a trail system; and 
(3)  Accessible from other portions of the development, with said accessibility provided for in the development plan. 
d.  For non-residential development the common open space requirement can be met by providing a minimum of 20 percent of the development as landscaped area, which exceeds the minimum standards imposed in Chapter 20.32 
4.  Buffer zones . 
a.  The applicant must demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, the proposed buffer zones between dissimilar uses within the development is sufficient. 
b.  Special design considerations such as height controls, density controls, architectural modifications, and landscaping buffers shall be incorporated in any portion of the development which adjoins a previously approved entitlement. 
5.  Landscaping on private property. Because a planned development may allow for increases in density, additional landscaping requirements may be imposed by the Administrator. The developer must provide an incentive plan for front yard landscaping and automated irrigation for single-family homes which will be approved as a part of the architectural manual. 
6.  Existing projects may be considered for planned development if, in the opinion of the Administrator, they do not pose any health, safety or welfare problems. 
7.  Dedication. Any land or interest therein within a planned unit development may be dedicated to the City for public use and maintenance, although the city is under no obligation to accept such dedication. In no event does land dedicated to and accepted by the City constitute common open space for the purposes of this chapter. 
C.  Tentative Application Process. 
1.  Pre-application conference. Prior to submitting a formal application, applicant will prepare a preliminary development plan for review by the administrator at an informal pre-application conference. Formal application for tentative approval must be made within six months following the pre-application conference. 
2.  Formal application. An application for tentative approval of the plan for a planned unit development must be filed with the Administrator by or on behalf of the landowner. The application will be made on a form provided by the Administrator. A preliminary development plan, design regulations and architecture manual must be submitted with the application. 
3.  Application fee. The application shall be accompanied by a fee as established by resolution of the City Council. 
D.  Procedure of Tentative Approval. 
1.  Staff review. The City staff will formally review the application, and development plan. Staff will evaluate the proposal and submit its recommendation for approval or denial to the Sparks Planning Commission. 
2.  Public hearing. A public hearing on the application shall be held by the Sparks Planning Commission. No application in tentative approval will be scheduled for consideration before the Planning Commission or City Council if the application contains errata sheets or is missing any of the contents required by Appendix A-4 Application contents. Public notice of the hearing shall be given in the manner prescribed by in Section 20.05.05. The hearing may be continued from time to time or the Planning Commission may refer the matter to the Planning Department for a further report, but the public hearing or hearings shall be concluded within 60 days after the date of the first public hearing unless the landowner consents in writing to an extension of the time within which the hearings shall be concluded. 
3.  Recommendation to grant, deny, or condition tentative approval. 
a.  Following the conclusion of the public hearing, the Planning Commission shall recommend: 
(1)  Granting tentative approval of the plan as submitted; 
(2)  Granting tentative approval of the plan subject to specified conditions not included in the plan as submitted; or 
(3)  Denying tentative approval of the plan. 
b.  If granting tentative approval is recommended, the Planning Commission shall, as part of its action, specify the drawings, specifications and any special financial assurances that shall accompany an application for final approval. 
4.  Findings of fact required. The recommendation must set forth the reasons for granting, with or without conditions, or for denying, and the minutes must set forth with particularity in what respects the plan would or would not be in the public interest, including but not limited to findings on the following: 
a.  In what respects the plan is or is not consistent with the statement of objectives of a planned unit development. 
b.  The extent to which the plan departs from zoning and subdivision regulations, otherwise applicable to the property, including but not limited to density, bulk and use, and the reasons why these departures are or are not deemed to be in the public interest. 
c.  The ratio of residential to nonresidential use in the planned unit development. 
d.  The purpose, location and amount of the common open space in the planned unit development, the reliability of the proposals for maintenance and conservation of the common open space, and the adequacy or inadequacy of the amount and purpose of the common open space as related to the proposed density and type of residential development. 
e.  The physical design of the plan and the manner in which the design does or does not make adequate provision for public services and utilities, provide adequate control over vehicular traffic, and further the amenities of light, air, recreation and visual enjoyment. 
f.  The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed planned unit development to the neighborhood in which it is proposed to be established. 
g.  In the case of a plan which proposes development over a period of years, the sufficiency of the terms and conditions intended to protect the interests of the public, residents and owners of the planned unit development in the integrity of the plan. 
5.  Specification of time for filing application for final approval. Unless the time is specified in an agreement entered into pursuant to NRS 278.0201, if a plan is recommended for tentative approval, an application for final approval of the plan, or any portion of the plan, must be filed within one year from the date of City Council tentative approval. In no event shall the first application for final approval be filed later than one year from the date of City Council tentative approval unless an alternative time frame is identified in the phasing of the project (as provided in the application for tentative approval). 
6.  The Planning Commission shall file a written report of its recommendation with the City Clerk who shall place it on the agenda of the City Council. The City Council shall: 
a.  Grant tentative approval of the plan as submitted; 
b.  Grant tentative approval of the plan subject to specified conditions not included in the plan as submitted; or 
c.  Deny tentative approval of the plan. 
7.  In its grant or denial of tentative approval, the City Council must conduct a hearing and provide findings of fact as delineated in subsection C.4 above. 
8.  The effect of tentative approval is to provide the applicant with a clear indication of requirements needed for final approval of the development plan including a schedule for submittal of application for final approval. Tentative approval does not qualify a plat or the planned unit development for recording or authorize development or the issuance of any building permit. 
E.  Final Approval Application. An application for final approval is a necessary precursor to the issuance of a permit under SMC Chapter 15 for construction activity. An application for final approval must be accompanied by a final development plan, design regulations and a fee in the amount established by resolution of City Council. 
F.  Procedure for Final Approval. 
1.  Application for final review by the Sparks Planning Commission and ultimate final approval by the Sparks City Council must be made to the Administrator within the time specified by the minutes granting tentative approval. 
2.  A public hearing on an application for final approval of the plan, or any part thereof, is not required if the plan, or any part thereof, submitted for final approval is in substantial compliance with the plan which has been given tentative approval. No application in final approval will be scheduled for consideration before the Planning Commission or City Council if the application contains errata sheets or is missing any of the contents required by Appendix A-4 Application contents. The plan submitted for final approval is in substantial compliance with the plan previously given tentative approval if any modification by the landowner of the plan as tentatively approved does not: 
a.  Vary the proposed gross residential density or intensity of use; 
b.  Vary the proposed ratio of residential to nonresidential use; 
c.  Involve a reduction of the area set aside for common open space or the substantial relocation of such area; 
d.  Substantially increase the floor area proposed for nonresidential use; or 
e.  Substantially increase the total ground areas covered by buildings or involve a substantial change in the height of buildings. 
3.  A public hearing need not be held to consider modifications in the location and design of streets or facilities for water and for disposal of storm water and sanitary sewage. 
4.  All requirements and regulations pertaining to the application for final approval, substantial compliance with tentatively approved plan, alternative proceedings for final action on plans not in substantial compliance, recourse to courts for failure of city to grant or deny final approval, certification and filing of approved plan upon abandonment or failure to carry out approved plan shall be provided in NRS 278A.530 to 278A.580, inclusive. 
G.  Modification of Final Approved Plan. 
1.  The following persons may file with the Administrator an application to modify an approved final plan: 
a.  An owner or owners of real property located within the boundaries of the planned unit development; 
b.  The master developer; or 
c.  Any other person, to the extent and in the manner expressly authorized by the provisions of the final approved plan. 
2.  All provisions of the plan authorized to be enforced by the City may be modified, removed or released by the City, except grants or easements relating to the service or equipment of a public utility unless expressly consented to by the public utility. The following provisions of the plan may be enforced, modified, removed or released by the City: 
a.  The use of land and the use, bulk and location of buildings and structures; 
b.  The quantity and location of common open space; 
c.  The intensity of use or the density of residential units; and 
d.  The ratio of residential to nonresidential uses. 
3.  Notice of a public hearing regarding an application for modification of an approved final plan shall be provided according to NRS 278.260 and SMC Section 20.05.03. 
4.  Procedure for decision. 
a.  Within 40 days after a public hearing, the Planning Commission shall file a written report with the City Clerk relative to the proposed modification. 
b.  The report shall recommend approval, denial, or conditional approval of the proposed modification. 
c.  Failure of the Planning Commission to file a report is deemed a recommendation for approval. 
d.  Within five days of filing the report with the City Clerk, the Planning Commission shall mail to the applicant notice of the recommendation. 
e.  Upon the filing of the report or the failure of the Planning Commission to file a report within 40 days, the City Clerk shall cause a bill prepared by the City Attorney to be placed on the agenda of the City Council for a first reading pursuant to Section 2.080(1) of the Sparks City Charter. 
f.  The City Council shall comply with the ordinance enactment procedures set forth in Section 2.080 of the Sparks City Charter. At the meeting of the City Council held pursuant to Section 2.080(2) of the City Charter, the City Council shall hold a public hearing relative to the report of the Planning Commission and the proposed modification before taking any action on the proposed modification. 
5.  Rights of residents. 
a.  No modification, removal or release of the provisions of an approved final plan by the City may affect the rights of the residents of a planned unit residential development to maintain and enforce those provisions. 
b.  All provisions of the plan shall run in favor of the residents of a planned unit residential development, but only to the extent expressly provided in the plan and in accordance with the terms of the plan and to that extent such provisions, whether recorded by plat, covenant, easement or otherwise, may be enforced at law or equity by the residents acting individually, jointly or through an organization designated in the plan to act on their behalf. 
c.  No provision of the plan exists in favor of residents on the planned unit residential development except as to those portions of the plan which have been finally approved and have been recorded. 
6.  Required findings. No modification, removal or release of the provisions of the plan by the City is permitted except upon a finding by the City, following a public hearing, that it: 
a.  Is consistent with the City's Comprehensive Plan and Truckee Meadows Regional Plan and otherwise consistent with Nevada and federal law; 
b.  Is consistent with the surrounding land uses; 
c.  Will be fiscally positive to the City for a period of at least 20 years if the site affected by the modification, removal or release is 20 or more acres and the modification, removal or release involves permitted uses, residential density or nonresidential intensity; 
d.  Furthers the mutual interest of the residents and owners of the planned unit development and of the public in the preservation of the integrity of the plan as finally approved; 
e.  Will not impair the reasonable reliance of the residents and owners upon the provisions of the plan; 
f.  Will not result in changes that would adversely affect the public interest; 
g.  Is consistent with the efficient development and preservation of the entire planned unit development; 
h.  Does not adversely affect either the enjoyment of land abutting upon or across a street from the planned unit development or the public interest; 
i.  Is not granted solely to confer a private benefit upon any person; and 
j.  Public notice was given and a public hearing held as required by the Sparks Municipal Code and Nevada Revised Statutes. 
H.  Judicial Review. Any decision of the City under this chapter granting or denying tentative or final approval of the plan or authorizing or refusing to authorize a modification in a plan is a final administrative decision and is subject to judicial review in properly presented cases. 
(Ord. 2547, § 1(Exh. A), Amended, 12/11/2017; Ord. 2512, § 1(Exh. A), Add. 08/24/2015) 
State Law reference- Planned development, Ch. 278A. 
Section 20.02.013 - Use table. 
    Purpose: The permitted, special and accessory uses within each zoning district are set out in the Use Table, below. The Use Table provides broad use categories, along with procedures for interpretation and ways to accommodate uses that are not specifically listed. 
A.  Generally. 
1.  No uses are allowed in any zoning district except those specifically listed as a permitted or conditional use in the Use Table. 
2.  All uses are subject to the dimensional standards in each zoning district, any additional regulations established by the zoning district, any regulations applicable to the use (Chapter 20.03), and the development standards (Chapter 20.04). 
3.  The Use Table establishes the following use categories: 
Notation Category Description P Permitted by right Permitted if the use meets the standards established in the zoning district. C Conditional Use Requires approval of a Conditional Use Permit. This may involve additional conditions to mitigate impacts on the surrounding neighborhood, in addition to other applicable requirements of this Title. * Use regulations apply In addition to the zoning district regulations, these uses are subject to additional regulations as provided in Chapter 20.03. AR Administrative Review Administrative review is required as a prerequisite to the issuance of building permits, whenever a Conditional Use Permit is not required for new commercial and industrial building construction/additions, new multiple-family residential, enlargement of a nonconforming use and for outdoor storage. (see Chapter 20.04). L "I" District Locational standards in the "I" district apply (see Section 20.02.009).  
B.  Unlisted Uses. 
Purpose: The list of permitted uses is both broad and comprehensive. However, it is impossible to contemplate every possible use, or new uses that did not exist when this section was written. To ensure that all uncontemplated uses have a path to approval, this subsection establishes procedures to obtain a conditional use permit for such a use. 
Generally. Uses not listed in the use table, are presumed to be prohibited. For uses not considered in the use table, a case can be made, the use is materially similar to uses permitted in the respective zoning district. The case will be considered by the Planning Commission through the Conditional Use Permit process. Conditional Use Findings will apply in addition to analysis pertaining to the following criteria: 
1.  Provide rationale the proposed use is consistent with uses permitted in the respective zoning district by utilizing a nationally accepted land use classification manual, such as the North American Industry Classification System ("NAICS"), American Planning Association or Land-Based Classification Standards LBCS Tables. 
2.  Document the actual or projected characteristics of the proposed use; 
3.  Document the relative number of employees; 
4.  Document hours of operation; 
5.  Demonstrate types of vehicles used and a parking analysis; 
6.  Provide a traffic analysis; 
7.  Analyze the impacts on surrounding properties; and 
8.  Provide analysis documenting the proposed use shall not generate average daily trips exceeding other uses proposed in the zoning district by more than ten percent (10%), as determined by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, Trip Generation or local traffic studies.

Section 20.03.004 - Adult business. 
Use Category: Public/Civic/Institutional -Arts, Entertainment & Recreation 
  
    Purpose and intent. 
    Purpose: Pursuant to NRS 278.022 et seq., special regulation of adult businesses is necessary to ensure that any possible adverse effects of these businesses will not be experienced by young people nor contribute to the blighting or downgrading of surrounding neighborhoods nor detract from the tourism efforts of the city, its redevelopment agency, and private businesses. With this in mind, the following purposes are furthered by this section. 
  To prevent exposure of materials subject to regulation by this Section to minors; 
 To prevent location of adult businesses near areas frequented by minors; 
  To prevent the concentration or clustering of adult businesses in any one area and away from areas frequented by tourists; 
  To avoid the possible degradation of area property values as a result of their proximity to adult businesses; and 
  To limit the potential spread of sexually transmitted diseases and the opportunity for the commission of public offenses, including but not limited to, solicitation, prostitution and the trafficking of controlled substances. 
    The City Council recognizes that adult businesses, because of their potentially objectionable operational characteristics, can have a deleterious effect on the adjacent areas, particularly when several of them are positioned in geographic proximity to each other under certain circumstances. This regulation is designed to minimize those effects. 
    It is the intent of this ordinance to: 
  Act consistently with the holdings of federal court cases by assuring adequate locations within the City of Sparks for the conduct of adult businesses and that regulations governing adult businesses are content neutral, provide a reasonable time, place and manner for regulations furthering the purposes of this section; and 
  To further the purpose of the zoning regulation as expressed in SMC 20.01.010. Sparks endeavors, through its planning and zoning regulations, to provide for its citizens and tourists an atmosphere that is both safe, healthy and aesthetically pleasing, one that fosters activities appropriate for visitors of all ages on its thoroughfares; and 
  Through its neighborhood planning program, recognize that some residential neighborhoods, because of their proximity to commercial districts, are more susceptible to the effect of intensive or obnoxious activities. This regulation aims to preserve neighborhood integrity while fostering a positive and wholesome image for visitors from out of the area. 
A.  Applicability. This Section applies to any "adult business" as defined in Chapter 20.08. 
B.  Exception. An "adult bookstore" which only has a segment or Section devoted to the sale, lease or display of material referred to in the definition of "adult book store" (see Chapter 20.08) is not subject to regulation under this section if all the following criteria are met: 
1.  The segment or section devoted to that material does not exceed seven percent of display or retail floor space of the business or 200 square feet, whichever is less; 
2.  The material is available only for sale or lease for private use by the purchaser or lessee outside and off the premises of the business; 
3.  The segment or Section devoted to those materials is segregated by partition, separate internal entrance, or otherwise obscured from casual observance by minors; 
4.  The segment or section is clearly signed to prohibit access by minors; 
5.  The segment or section is adequately staffed or within view of staff or otherwise controlled to assure monitoring of minors who may seek access to that segment or section; 
6.  The business in which that a segment or section is located may not advertise itself or hold itself out to the public as being an adult business, whether by store window displays, signs or other means; and 
7.  A business claiming this exception must not be combined with any other business to result in an increase in the floor area devoted to adult material beyond the maximum specified here. 
C.  Location Restrictions. 
1.  Adult businesses, as defined in subsection A.1, may be located in the industrial (I) zoning district if they comply with the following: 
a.  No adult business may be located on a parcel which abuts a freeway, expressway or major or minor arterial roadway. 
b.  No adult business may be located within 1,000 feet of any residential property. 
c.  No adult business may be located within 1,000 feet of any of the following:

(10)  Any teenage dance hall, teenage entertainment location, or teenage nightclub as defined and regulated in Chapter 5.75 of the Sparks Municipal Code. 
2.  Distances shall be measured from property line to property line. 
D.  Waiver of Location Restrictions. The City Council may waive the location restrictions contained in subsection B for any adult business if it makes the following findings: 
1.  The proposed use will not be contrary to the public interest or injurious to nearby properties, and that the spirit and intent of this chapter will be observed; 
2.  The proposed use will not enlarge or encourage the development of a "skid row" area; 
3.  The establishment of an additional regulated use in the area will not be contrary to any program of neighborhood conservation, nor will it interfere with any program of redevelopment; and/or 
4.  All applicable regulations of this code will be observed. 
E.  Signs and Displays. The following general regulations apply to all adult businesses: 
1.  No product for sale or gift, or picture or other graphic representation of the product, shall be displayed so as to be visible from the street or exterior of the building. 
2.  No advertising sign may be equipped with animated or flashing electric illumination.

Use Category: Public/Civic/Institutional-Educational 
  
    Purpose: This section protects the public health, safety and general welfare of City residents, and implements NRS 278.0211 by standardizing the development standards for schools in the region (Sparks, Reno, Washoe County). The objectives of these standards are: 1) well-designed schools; 2) to mitigate the impacts of schools next to residential uses; 3) promote consistency; 4) provide an appropriate number of parking spaces and 5) provide flexibility in landscaping areas. 
A.  Applicability. This section applies to the new construction of any new school (public or private). 
B.  Standards. 
1.  The City's review of school projects will consider the following criteria during the administrative plan review process:

2.  Site Standards. The following standards deal with the erection of any new school building, and the addition or alteration of an existing school building. 
a.  Building Height. There are no restrictions on the building height of a school. 
b.  Purpose: Having no minimum or maximum height requirements provides for the flexibility to build unique facilities consistent with the character of the neighboring community. In the future schools in the urban core may have a smaller footprint and be two or more stories in height. Depending on the type of school and the amenities it offers, the height will need to vary. 
c.  Building setbacks. One foot distance for every foot in height when adjacent to residential uses. The one foot requirement does apply only to those elevations adjacent to residential uses. Each elevation will determine the amount of setback, for instance a 25-foot front facing elevation will require a 25-foot setback in the front, a 30-foot side elevation will require a 30-foot setback on that side, and that same building that has a rear facing elevation adjacent to a use other than residential will have no setback requirement. 
d.  Landscaping. Up to 20 percent of the site. Landscaping details will be determined based on type of school, community character, and site specifics such as slope and soil quality. These details will be determined during a pre-application meeting with the City and WCSD. 
e.  Parking. This is a minimum standard and also presumes all relevant Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) requirements will be met. 
C.  Review. Administrative approval (standard code and administrative review) applies.

Section 20.03.046 - Wireless communication tower or antenna. 
Use Category: Infrastructure-Communications facilities 
  
    Purpose: This section establishes general guidelines for the locations of wireless communications towers and antennas. The goals of this chapter are to: (1) protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers and antennas; (2) encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas; (3) minimize the total number of towers throughout the community; (4) strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; (5) encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal; (6) encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques; (7) enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently; (8) consider the public health, education and safety of communication towers; and (9) avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering and careful siting of tower structures. In furtherance of these goals, the City of Sparks shall give due consideration to the City of Sparks master plan, zoning map, existing land uses, and environmentally sensitive areas in approving sites for the location of towers and antennas. 
A.  Applicability. 
1.  This section applies to any "wireless communication tower or antenna." 
2.  New towers and antennas. All new towers or antennas in the City of Sparks are subject to these regulations. 
B.  Exemptions. 
1.  Amateur radio station operators/receive only antennas. This section does not apply to any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is under 70 feet in height and owned and operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio station operator or used exclusively for receive only antennas. 
2.  Direct home satellite dishes. Subject to appropriate FCC regulations, this Section does not apply to video programming signals from direct broadcast satellites, multichannel multipoint distribution providers and television broadcast stations. 
3.  Preexisting towers or antennas. Preexisting towers and preexisting antennas are not required to meet the requirements of this section, other than the requirements of subsections C.6, 8 and 14. 
AM array. For purposes of implementing this chapter, an AM array, consisting of one or more tower units and supporting ground system which functions as one AM broadcasting antenna, shall be considered one tower. Measurements for setbacks and separation distances shall be measured from the outer perimeter of the towers included in the AM array. Additional tower units may be added within the perimeter of the AM array by right. 
C.  General Requirements. 
1.  Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use of an existing structure on the same lot does not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. 
2.  Lot size. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with the City of Sparks zoning/special use regulations, including but not limited to setback requirements, lot-coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lot. 
3.  Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower shall provide to the director an inventory of its existing towers, antennas, or sites approved for towers or antennas, that are either within the jurisdiction of the City of Sparks or within one mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The director may share the information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or conditional use permits under this chapter or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the City of Sparks. However, the Administrator is not, by sharing the information, in any way representing or warranting that any sites are available or suitable. 
4.  Aesthetics. Towers and antennas shall meet the following requirements: 
a.  Towers shall be constructed of steel, or other appropriate materials and either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or aesthetic requirements imposed by the Administrator are painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
b.  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend them into the natural setting, surrounding buildings and site area. 
c.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive. 
5.  Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the lighting alternatives and design chosen must cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. 
6.  State or federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If those standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this ordinance shall bring the towers and antennas into compliance with the revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of the standards and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling state or federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with the revised standards and regulations is constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. 
7.  FCC notification requirements. Each applicant shall provide to the Administrator within 60 days after the construction of an appropriate antenna/tower, written documentation confirming that the FCC has been notified of the location of the antenna/tower for inclusion in the FCC antenna registration database. A change in ownership or affiliation of the tower or any changes in collocation must be accompanied by verified documentation that the FCC and its antenna registration database have been notified of the change. Failure to timely provide the director with written documentation concerning FCC notification is grounds for removal of the tower or antenna.

(a)  The antenna does not extend more than 30 feet above the highest point of the structure; 
(b)  The antenna complies with all applicable FCC and FAA regulations; and 
(2)  Antennas on existing towers. An antenna which is attached to an existing tower may be approved by the Administrator and, to minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of towers, collocation of antennas by more than one carrier on existing towers takes precedence over the construction of new towers. This applies if: 
(a)  The tower is modified or reconstructed to accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna is of the same tower type as the existing tower, unless the Administrator allows reconstruction as a monopole. 
(b)  Height. 
i.  An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller height, not to exceed 30 feet over the tower's existing height, to accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna. 
ii.  The height change as listed above may only occur one time per communication tower. 
iii.  The additional height referred to above does not require an additional distance separation as set forth in this title. The tower's pre-modification height is used to calculate the distance separations. 
(c)  On-site location. 
i.  A tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna may be moved on-site within 50 feet of its existing location. 
ii.  After the tower is rebuilt to accommodate collocation, only one tower may remain on the site.

E.  Parking District No. 1. 
The purpose of Town Center Parking District No. 1 is to: 
  Provide for the use of parking spaces in city owned facilities to provide businesses within the district which are not able to provide the required off-street parking required by this section; and 
  Provide for leasing of parking spaces in city owned parking facilities to private businesses to further the goals of the redevelopment effort. 
1.  Victorian Square Parking District No. 1 is established. 
2.  Boundaries. The boundaries of the parking district are described as follows: 
Beginning at the intersection of the centerline of Victorian Avenue and the centerline of Fifteenth Street, and proceeding thence northerly along said extended line to its intersection with the centerline of D Street and Victorian Plaza Circle, thence easterly along the centerline of D street to its intersection with the centerline of the Pyramid Way, with the centerline of Victorian Avenue, extended westerly along said centerline to its point of origin. 
3.  Parking space fee. 
a.  The City Council may, by resolution, approve and adopt a form of agreement for the use of spaces in the parking district which include, but are not limited to, penalties for late payments, security for the payment of obligations, maintenance provisions and procedures to withdraw from the parking district. 
b.  Terms of this agreement may be negotiated subject to specific redevelopment agreements developed in cooperation with the Sparks Redevelopment Agency. 
4.  Requirements for commercial uses marked with a diamond (?) in Parking Ratio Table are modified for Parking District No. 1 by the following exemption program: 
a.  The indicated commercial uses are exempt from all parking requirements if they qualify based on one of the following three criteria: 
(1)  New construction of a building less than 10,000 square feet in size; 
(2)  New construction of a building addition where the total area of the building addition and the existing building is less than 10,000 square feet in size; 
(3)  An indicated commercial use occupying an existing building of less than 10,000 square feet in size. 
b.  If the 10,000 square foot limit is exceeded for an indicated commercial use, the use shall receive a parking exemption equal to the 10,000 square foot limit, and is responsible for providing parking for the area exceeding the 10,000 square foot limit in accordance with the requirements listed in the parking ratio table. 
c.  If a business has existing excess parking, it may count that excess parking towards any new parking required as a result of expansion or new construction. 
5.  Petition for inclusion in the parking district. At any time following the district formation, any parcel of land, whether contiguous or noncontiguous to the district, may be added to the district if the use is identified with a diamond and the owner of such parcel files with the City Council a petition for inclusion and the City Council grants such petition. The City Council must find that sufficient additional parking space is available in the parking district and that inclusion will benefit the parking district in order to grant the petition. If the petition is granted, the parcel is then entitled to the same rights as those which apply to other lands in the district, and is subject to all fees levied on a district member. 
6.  Requirements for hotel/casino uses in Victorian Square Parking District No. 1 are 50 percent of what is required in Table 20.04.011-3 Parking Ratios. 
F.  Off-street Loading. 
1.  In order to avoid undue interference with the public use of streets or alleys, there shall be provided and maintained adequate off-street space for standing, loading or unloading for those uses involving receipt and distribution of vehicles or merchandise and materials off-street. 
2.  Loading space design. 
a.  Each required loading space shall be at least ten feet by 45 feet with a 14-foot height clearance. 
b.  For a non-residential building containing less than 3,000 square feet of gross floor area, a combined parking and loading area is acceptable.

Notes: 
[1] The calculation for the freestanding signs maximum area shall be the sign area including centers name and tenant panels excluding the architectural embellishments to the sign. 
[2] The sign structure may extend above the sign by 20% of the height of a freestanding sign or if (i) the sign structure is separately constructed from the cabinet or face of the sign, (ii) the portion above the cabinet or face does not contain any copy, and (iii) the extension adds architectural embellishment to the sign. 
[3] The height of the sign may be measured from the elevation of the centerline of the nearest travel lane of the street or highway to which the sign is oriented rather than from "grade." 
  
3.  Special freestanding signs. In addition to other allowances, one special freestanding sign shall be permitted on each site in the "I" zoning districts under the following circumstances. 
a.  When applying for the sign permit, the applicant will designate the proposed sign as its special freestanding sign hereunder, and the sign will be specially marked in accordance with instructions from the Department to indicate it is a special freestanding sign. 
b.  The special freestanding sign area may not exceed 672 square feet. The sign is not counted against the maximum allowable sign area. If the actual size of the sign is less than 672 sq ft, the difference cannot be added to allowable sign area. 
c.  Rather than from "grade" as defined above, the height of the sign may be measured from the elevation of the centerline of the nearest travel lane of the street or highway to which the sign is oriented. 
d.  Otherwise, each special freestanding sign is subject to and must comply with all other provisions of this chapter, applicable to a freestanding sign except as otherwise indicated. 
e.  If the sign is digital sign or uses other method of illumination with LED or similar illumination, the special freestanding sign must comply with subsection I.6. 
f.  For moving or trivision signs, the minimum exposure time for each panel is ten seconds and maximum twirl time is two seconds. 
4.  Special monument signs. In addition to other allowances, one special monument sign shall be permitted for each entrance of each site in all zoning districts specified in subsection I.2 above under the following circumstances and subject to the following conditions and requirements. 
a.  No special monument sign area may exceed 32 square feet. The area of the sign shall not be counted against the maximum allowable sign area for the site, and if the sign is smaller than 32 square feet, the difference shall not be added to the maximum allowable sign area for the site. 
b.  Special monument signs are subject to and must comply with all other requirements of this Chapter applicable to monument signs, except: 
(1)  They may not be illuminated, and may not be digital signs. 
(2)  The architectural requirement in subsection I.5.g does not apply. 
5.  Other standards, limitations and requirements for freestanding or monument signs. 
a.  Sign separation distance. 
(1)  Monument signs. No monument sign (including a special monument sign) may be within twenty feet radius distance of any other monument sign. 
(2)  Freestanding signs. Except for special freestanding signs: 
(a)  No freestanding sign may be within 100 feet linear distance of any other freestanding sign. 
(b)  If the freestanding sign includes a digital sign, the radial distance to another digital sign is 200 feet. 
b.  Special freestanding signs. A special freestanding sign may be placed within 1,500 linear feet distance of a freestanding sign (except an "outdoor advertising structure" as defined in subsection N.1, but no special freestanding sign may be placed within 1500 linear feet distance of any other special freestanding sign or an "outdoor advertising structure" as defined in subsection N.1. Any special freestanding sign prior in existence to adoption of this ordinance may be converted to digital and shall be located a minimum of 1,500 linear feet from any other special freestanding sign. Any nonconforming outdoor adverting structure in existence prior to adoption of this ordinance which meets the requirements for a special freestanding sign, may be converted to digital and shall be located a minimum of 1,500 linear feet from any other special freestanding sign. Any new special freestanding sign constructed after adoption of the ordinance from which this title derives shall be a minimum of 1,500 linear feet from any other special freestanding sign, except that if the special freestanding sign is digital, it shall be a minimum of 3,000 linear feet from any other digital special freestanding sign. 
c.  Extension over property lines. All freestanding or monument signs must be located on one site only and shall not extend over the property line to another site. 
d.  Extension into right-of-way. All freestanding or monument signs, except for signs displayed in the Town Center Redevelopment Area of the city, shall not extend into any public right-of-way. 
e.  Minimum setback for safe siting standards. 
(1)  Except as provided in subsection (b) below, all freestanding and monument signs (including special freestanding and monument signs) must be located outside of the control area defined below and shall be located in accordance with the most recent edition of American Association State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASTHO) "Roadside Design Guide" and stamped by registered engineer. 
(a)  For intersections of public streets with residential, collector, or arterial streets where the travel lane is a minimum of five feet from the edge of pavement: The control area is that area between the property lines and a line drawn between a point 15 feet back from the point of curvature of the intersection as measured at the property side of the sidewalk on each leg of the intersection. If no sidewalk exists, the measurement will be along the curb line. 
(b)  For intersections of private driveways with residential, collector, or arterial streets where the travel lane is a minimum of five feet from the edge of pavement: The control area is that area between the property line and a line drawn between a point 10 feet back from the intersection of the driveway and the sidewalk as measured at the property side of the sidewalk and a line drawn to the point 10 feet back from the intersection of the driveway and the sidewalk as measured on the driveway. If no sidewalk exists, the measurement will be from the intersection of the driveway and the curb. 
(c)  For intersections of public streets with arterial streets where the travel lane is at the edge of pavement: The control area is that area between the property lines and a line drawn between a point 15 feet back from the point of curvature of the intersection as measured at the property side of the sidewalk on the minor leg of the intersection and a point 50 feet back from the point of curvature of the intersection as measured at the property side of the sidewalk on the major leg of the intersection. If no sidewalk exists, the measurement will be along the curb line. 
(d)  For intersections of private driveways with arterial streets where the travel lane is at the edge of pavement: The control area is that area between the property line and a line drawn between a point 15 feet back from the intersection of the driveway and the sidewalk as measured at the property side of the sidewalk and a line drawn to the point 15 feet back from the intersection of the driveway and the sidewalk as measured on the driveway. If no sidewalk exists, the measurement will be from the intersection of the driveway and the curb. 
(2)  All freestanding and monument signs (including special freestanding and monument signs) to be located within the control area shall be in conformance with the safe siting standards set forth in the current edition of A Policy on Geometric Design of Highway and Streets, published by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, and as established by an analysis sealed by a professional engineer licensed in Nevada opining that the sign does not violate those safe siting standards. 
(3)  If a permanent building extends into a control area as described above, freestanding, monument and special monument signs may be placed parallel to and within six inches of the walls of the building that extend into the control area, provided that the signs do not block any windows and do not extend beyond or wrap around the corner or edge of the walls. If it is impossible to locate a sign as specified herein because the building abuts the property line, a building sign may be placed on the wall that extends into the control area notwithstanding the limitation of the number of building signs set forth in subsection H.2, provided: (1) the sign is not a projecting sign, (2) the sign does not extend beyond or wrap around the corner or edge of any projecting sign, (3) the sign does not cover any windows, and (4) if the building sign is erected in lieu of a special monument sign, a building permit is obtained under Title 15 of the Sparks Municipal Code, if required. 
f.  Residential. Permits are not required for residential signs.

d.  If a sign permit is required, the permit must be obtained from the City before construction or installation is started. If a building permit is required under Chapter 15.08 ("Sign Code") of this code, it will be included as a part of the sign permit. 
2.  General provisions applicable to all permits. 
a.  Application and fees. Applicants shall use forms and provide information as required by the department, and shall submit fees in the amounts provided by resolution or ordinance, and shall submit the fees at the times required by the department. Fees are nonrefundable, even if a sign permit is denied. 
b.  Application date. The application date is the date that the department receives at its counter an application on the form provided by the department. An application which contains blanks where information is required to be filled in, or which does not include all the attachments required, or is not accompanied by any fees which must be submitted with the application may be rejected at the counter and is not deemed "received." Otherwise, the application is deemed received. 
c.  Incomplete applications. Applications which do not contain all the information necessary, in the opinion of the Administrator, to determine compliance with this Chapter shall be denied. If convenient to department personnel, an applicant may be contacted to bring in additional information and the application may be held pending receipt of information, but if the information is not received by the action deadline, the application is deemed denied. If an application is denied for being incomplete, fees will not be refunded. 
d.  Processing. The application will be simultaneously processed by the Building Official, who shall determine compliance with the requirements of Title 15 of Sparks Municipal Code, and the Administrator, who shall determine compliance with this chapter and any other applicable provision. 
e.  Standards. The Building official shall make his decision based on compliance with the requirements of Chapter 15.08 of this Code. The Administrator shall make his decision based on compliance with this chapter and with any other applicable chapter of the Sparks Municipal Code. A denial of a permit must be based on a determination that, if approved, the sign described in the permit would violate an identifiable standard in Sparks Municipal Code. 
f.  Conditional approvals. Conditions related to the application and enforcement of this Chapter may be imposed as a part of an approval of a permit. If any condition is not satisfied when due, it shall be treated as a violation of the permit. 
g.  Effect of denial; judicial relief. In addition to any rights available to an aggrieved applicant under NRS 278.0233 and 278.0235, if an application is denied, the applicant may file or cause to be filed in the district court a petition for judicial examination of the validity of the denial as provided by NRS 34.185. 
h.  Effect of approval of permit. Approval of a permit means that the sign described in the permit may be built subject to the terms and conditions stated in the permit, provided that the sign is constructed and continuously maintained in accordance with the provisions of this chapter even if the application describes a sign which does not comply with the provisions of this chapter. 
3.  Sign permits. 
a.  Action deadline; failure to reject by deadline waives permit requirements. For sign permits (except temporary sign permits), the "action deadline" is close of business on the thirtieth calendar day (starting with the first business day following the application date) following the application date. If the "action deadline" falls on a weekend or holiday, it is extended to close of business on the first business day following the weekend or holiday. By the action deadline, both the Building Official and the Administrator shall either approve or deny the application. The application is deemed denied if either the Building Official or the Administrator denies it even if the other approves it. If the application is neither approved nor denied by the action deadline, the applicant shall have a right to construct the sign in accordance with the provisions of this Title and Title 15 of the Sparks Municipal Code except for the requirement of a permit. 
b.  Notice of denial. If an application is denied, a written notice shall be prepared and mailed or hand delivered to the applicant, first class mail, at the address indicated on the application, within five working days following the denial. The written notice of denial shall include the reason for the denial. If the denial is for an incomplete application, the notice shall specify what information needs to be submitted if the application is resubmitted. The deadline for filing for any judicial relief does not commence until this written notice is mailed or hand delivered to the applicant. 
4.  Temporary sign permits. 
a.  Expedited permit process; action deadline. The Administrator shall establish an expedited application and approval process for temporary signs, including a simplified application form which could be approved or disapproved over the counter (i) under ordinary circumstances, (ii) if every blank is correctly and completely filled in. If an approval of another official is required (such as approval of the airport authority for signs using searchlights), the permit may be approved subject to the condition that the applicant obtain such approval and the permit shall not be valid until that condition is met. 
b.  Notification. Notification of approval or disapproval shall be in person, or by telephone, e-mail, fax or other expeditious form of communication. 
5.  Suspension and revocation of sign permits. Any permit issued in error, or in reliance on an application which contains false, misleading, or incomplete information that was material to the Administrator's decision may be suspended and revoked by the Administrator. The applicant shall be given the notice required by subsection 5 of this section and shall have the right to judicial review as provided in subsection 6 of this section as if the suspension or revocation were a denial of an application. 
6.  Violation of permit. It is unlawful to build or alter a sign in such a way that it does not strictly conform to the permit or any condition in the permit, the application for the permit, or the standards and requirements of this chapter. 
N.  Nonconforming Signs. 
1.  Nonconforming outdoor advertising structures. If a nonconforming sign is a "nonconforming outdoor advertising structure," as defined in state law (see 2001 Statutes of Nevada, chapter 451 or SB 265 of the 2001 legislature), the following provisions apply: 
a.  Neither the sign nor supporting structure may be increased in size or height, nor may there be an addition or enhancement to the structure that increases the visual effect or increases the impact on the use of the site, including conversion to digital sign. 
b.  The nonconforming outdoor advertising structure shall be removed on the earlier of: 
(1)  In excess of 50 percent of the material structural value of the sign is damaged or destroyed as a result of a natural disaster, including, without limitation, a fire, flood, earthquake, windstorm, rainstorm and snowstorm. 
(2)  A resolution of the City Council (not related to the development or redevelopment of the site) orders removal of the sign which resolution provides for just compensation or relocation rights as required by state law. The City Council shall give written notice to the owner of the site in accordance with Chapter 241 of Nevada Revised Statutes (the open meeting law), and shall hold a public hearing prior to considering such a resolution. 
(3)  Upon the termination of any lease or rental agreement which governs the location of the sign on the site. 
c.  Until an event enumerated in the subsection above occurs, the nonconforming outdoor advertising structure may remain on the site, and may be given routine maintenance. 
2.  Other nonconforming signs. The following provisions apply to nonconforming signs which are not "nonconforming outdoor advertising structure," as defined in state law (see 2001 Statutes of Nevada, chapter 451 or SB 265 of the 2001 legislature). 
a.  Height and size. Neither the sign nor supporting structure may be increased in size or height, nor may there be an addition or enhancement to the structure that increases the visual effect or increases the impact on the use of the site, including conversion to digital sign. 
b.  Right to maintain and continue use. A nonconforming sign may be maintained and continued in use, provided that: 
(1)  It is not altered, enlarged or relocated without a sign permit (but see subsection N.2.a below); 
(2)  It is maintained in good repair and does not become unsightly or hazardous. 
3.  Termination of right to nonconforming sign. 
a.  Any nonconforming sign which is a safety hazard shall be removed or repaired within ten days of notice to the owner of the site. 
b.  Any nonconforming sign which requires repairs costing in excess of 50 percent of its replacement value shall be removed or made to comply with the provisions of this chapter. 
4.  Alteration, enlargement or relocation. No sign permit shall be issued for the alteration, enlargement or relocation of a nonconforming sign unless the changes will increase the level of conformance with the provisions of this chapter. An existing nonconforming sign cannot be converted to digital unless it is brought into conformance with this code. An existing nonconforming digital sign may be replaced or enhanced as long as the changes will increase the level of conformance with the provisions of this chapter. 
O.  Abandoned Signs. 
1.  Criteria for establishing abandonment. A sign or sign structure shall be considered abandoned when any of the following occurs: 
a.  Any business advertised thereon is no longer in business and has not been in business anywhere for more than 90 days; 
b.  Any product or service advertised thereon is no longer offered and has not been offered for the past 90 days; 
c.  The structure no longer supports a sign for a period of 90 days; 
d.  The sign, structure or advertising display is visibly damaged or partially missing. 
e.  Internal or halo illumination is partially or wholly burned out or inoperative. 
2.  Removal of abandoned signs. Any sign or sign structure which has been abandoned shall be removed or restored to use within thirty days after a notice of abandonment is issued to the owner of the site. Notice shall be given by the Administrator using certified mail. The Administrator may allow an abandoned sign or sign structure to remain in place provided that the sign or sign structure is maintained in good condition, and that there is a reasonable possibility that the sign can be restored to use within a one-year period. 
P.  Variances and Deviations. 
1.  Variances under Chapter 20.16 [Section 20.05.012] may not be granted from the provisions of this chapter. 
2.  Major and minor deviations, as provided in Chapter 20.05, may not be granted under this chapter.

(Ord. 2547, § 1(Exh. A), Amended, 12/11/2017; Ord. 2512, § 1(Exh. A), Add. 08/24/2015) 
Section 20.04.011 - Slopes, hilltops and ridges. 
    Purpose: this chapter regulates development on hills and slopes to promote quality land development by regulating the potential for the aesthetic degradation of sites through orderly development with slopes in conjunction with of the City's natural environment and scenic backdrop. 
A.  Applicability. 
1.  A presubmittal meeting with staff is required for any development project to be undertaken on project sites having slope gradients of at least ten percent or greater over at least 25 percent of the site. For development greater than ten acres and/or when exceeding any minimum standard in this section a conditional use permit may be applied for. For projects less than ten acres and compliance with standards is demonstrated, the administrative review process shall be utilized. 
2.  The minimum average slope of a project site is used to identify the threshold (i.e., a slope map). 
3.  The major deviation process (See Chapter 20.05) does not apply to this section. 
B.  Design Policies. Any development subject to the requirements of this Section shall be designed in accordance with the best applicable practices of land use planning, engineering, geology, hydrology, civil and structural engineering, environmental design, architecture and landscape architecture, including but not limited to the following: 
1.  The site of the proposed development shall be analyzed to identify the design constraints imposed by hydrological and geological conditions, soils, slopes and other natural topographic conditions. In order to secure a conditional use permit, the project shall respect the natural constraints in the design of the development. 
2.  The development shall be designed with consideration for limiting aesthetic degradation of the site, as well as erosion, sedimentation and other hazards. 
3.  Long slopes with sharp transitions are generally considered undesirable. 
4.  Buildings should be designed and placed on the site so as to visually complement each other and the natural land forms of the site. The placement of buildings on or near hilltops or ridges must show a high degree of sensitivity to the terrain and its visual impact. Definitive plans shall be prepared that clearly demonstrate this sensitivity for project approval. 
C.  Grading. 
1.  No grading or clearing of any kind may be initiated until a final grading permit is issued unless exempted by Sparks Municipal Code Title 15. Grading shall also comply with the most restrictive requirements of Title 15 of the Sparks Municipal Code. 
2.  Grading shall be designed so that finished grading resembles natural land forms as much as practical with rounded transitions or variable slope gradients. 
3.  A graded slope that exceeds 33 percent (3:1) and over three feet in height shall have a solution presented that stabilizes the slope and minimizes scarring. 
4.  The portion of any development site which may be cleared, graded or otherwise disturbed by construction is limited to a percentage of the site area, based on the natural slope of the site, as follows: 
a.  The applicant shall provide a slope or "cell" map which groups small areas of similar slope together, gridded at a maximum contour interval of 2 feet. 
b.  The slope categories or groups are as listed below. This establishes the maximum disturbed area within each slope category over the entire site. 
c.  Then the maximum area within each category that can be disturbed is calculated by applying the fraction indicated below: 
Slope Category Maximum Disturbed Area 0-15 % Unlimited 16-25% 3/4 of the category 26-30% 1/3 of the category 30% or above When developing on natural slopes over 30% project design shall be enhanced to create a 2:1 ratio of non-constrained area being preserved as open space for every portion of area with slopes over 30% that is developed  
  
d.  Once the calculation of disturbed area is made, this becomes the total disturbed area over the entire site. Disturbed areas can be aggregated and do not need to be specific to the slope category. 
5.  The final grading plan for the development shall include mapping and calculations necessary to demonstrate compliance with these requirements. 
6.  Before a grading permit is issued, a temporary fence shall be constructed on the site defining the limits of the area to be disturbed as shown on the final grading plan. That fence shall be inspected and approved by the Administrator before the grading permit is issued and shall remain in place until final grading inspection and approval. 
D.  Erosion and Sedimentation Control. 
1.  For any project which involves a graded area larger than one acre, a temporary erosion and sedimentation plan, including dust control must be approved by the Administrator before a grading permit is issued. If grading of an area larger than one acre is to proceed in phases, the erosion and sedimentation control plan shall contain a phasing schedule showing how large an area will be exposed at any one time. Land will be considered exposed from the time it is cleared, graded or otherwise disturbed until it is permanently stabilized by paving, landscaping or vegetation according to approved plans. 
2.  At any time during construction when more than one acre is exposed, all temporary erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be continuously applied and maintained. 
3.  In order to keep the grading permit valid, a bond or other surety in an amount determined by the Administrator must be provided by the developer. 
E.  Landscaping. 
1.  In addition to the landscaping requirements of this chapter, landscaping and/or revegetation is required to stabilize all slopes which have been: 
a.  Cleared; 
b.  Graded; 
c.  Otherwise disturbed by development subject to this section; or 
d.  Visible from public rights-of-way. 
2.  Landscaping shall be dispersed throughout the stabilized area. 
3.  Interior side yard sloped areas of individual lots are exempt from the landscaping and irrigation requirement. 
4.  Planting shall be designed to achieve 90 percent ground coverage of any disturbed area within three years. 
F.  Open Space. 
1.  Any portion of a development on which clearing and grading is not allowed under subsection C (undisturbed area) must be: 
a.  Placed within any required open space; 
b.  Protected from disturbance through fencing or other permanent access restrictions, or 
c.  Subject to a permanent open space deed restriction in favor of the city. 
2.  If the application involves subdivision plat approval, the applicant must provide a plan to maintain any required open space which is not a part of a developed lot. 
3.  Open space areas shall include a variety of slope gradients and not contain only slopes within one slope category. 
4.  The open space must be accessible to the residents. 
G.  Hilltops or Ridgelines. Any hilltop or ridgeline, that is identified by the City as a significant hilltop or ridgeline, shall have additional setback requirements. The setback requirement shall vary dependent on the slope(s) of the ridgeline or hilltop and the proposed heights or structures. 

H.  Application Requirements. In addition to the usual requirements for a Conditional Use Permit or Administrative Review; the application for any development subject to the requirements of this Section shall include the information required in Appendix A7 and A8. 
(Ord. 2547, § 1(Exh. A), Amended, 12/11/2017; Ord. 2512, § 1(Exh. A), Add. 08/24/2015) 
Section 20.04.012 - Truckee River Corridor. 
    Purpose: The Truckee River Corridor is established in order to protect ecological balance and water quality of the Truckee River as well as to preclude the possibility of obstructing the flow of stormwaters. 
A.  Applicability. 
1.  This section applies to all development in the Truckee River Corridor, defined in subsection 2 below. 
2.  The Truckee River Corridor comprises 2 zones as follows: 
Zone Definition Zone I The area lying between the centerline of the Truckee River and the northern boundary line of the Truckee River Green belt. Zone II The area adjoining Zone I and running to a line parallel to and at a distance of 200 feet to the north of Zone I.  
  
B.  Permitted Uses. 
1.  Zone I. Landscaped areas using organic and inorganic plant material which enhances the natural appearance of the corridor, public pedestrian and equestrian trails and service roads, public parking, recreation areas, and facilities. 
2.  Zone II. All permitted uses in underlying zoning district if: 
a.  Parking lots areas are screened by landscape material or fencing so as not to be visible from Zone I. 
b.  Outdoor storage is screened and fenced. 
c.  Cut and fill areas are stabilized with organic and/or inorganic landscape material. 
d.  Applicants install drought-tolerant, native species of plants and trees that are not otherwise prohibited as a nuisance plant or tree. 
Parking lots, outdoor uses and outdoor storage areas are screened so as not to be visible from the Truckee River Trail. Where the Truckee River Trail is elevated more than three feet above grade of the parking lot, outdoor use, or outdoor storage site, the Administrator may approve screening that partially screens or reduces the visual impact of the operations from view of the Truckee River Trail. 
(Ord. 2512, § 1(Exh. A), Add. 08/24/2015) 
Section 20.04.013 - Utilities. 
    Purpose: this section establishes the standards for utilities improvements, including water, sewer, , electrical, gas, telephone, cable, and related improvements associated with any development located outside of the public right-of-way. 
A.  Applicability. 
1.  This subsection does not apply if the parcel is part of a subdivision or a development agreement where the City has determined that there is sufficient capacity for, and has approved the design of, water, sewer, electrical, gas, telephone, cable, and related improvements for the proposed use. 
2.  Administrative review is required if the utility project has not been approved as part of a subdivision plat application (unless a conditional use permit is required). 
3.  The requirement for a conditional use permit and/or administrative review is not required for projects with an associated building permit. 
B.  Easements and Dedication. 
1.  Development plans shall identify needed right-of-way or easement locations necessary for the provision of utilities, drainage and vehicular or pedestrian circulation within the development which meet specified levels of service called for in adopted City plans and policies. Easements may be granted and right-of-way dedicated to the public by the applicant as part of the development approval process or through separate instrument, which shall be in a form approved by the City Attorney. 
2.  Drainage easements needed for stormwater management as indicated on an approved drainage or grading plan shall be provided. 
3.  Utility easements required by the various public and private utilities shall be provided. The various utility agencies and the City of Sparks shall be consulted as to current policy on design and required easement widths. 
4.  Vegetation located on utility easements shall be placed so as to not interfere with the free movement of service vehicles. 
5.  Structures shall not be placed on utility easements.

Section 20.05.001 - Generally. 
A.  Applicability. 
1.  This chapter applies to any application of land development approval in the City. 
2.  This chapter establishes procedures for land development decisions made under this chapter. These include: 
a.  Legislative decisions, including rezoning and changes to this Zoning Code and the Master Plan. These involve a new policy or rule, or a change in land development policy. 
b.  Quasi-judicial decisions, including conditional use permits and variances. These proceedings require a weighing of the evidence, a balancing of the equities, an application of rules, regulations and ordinances to facts and a resolution of specific issues. These also involve a public hearing and the exercise of discretion by the decision-making body. 
c.  Administrative decisions, such as building permits and certificates of occupancy. These apply this code or conditions of a quasi-judicial decision to a specific project that is either clearly defined in this code, or that has already obtained all necessary legislative and quasi-judicial approvals. Because these involve the application of non-discretionary crules to specific projects, these decisions are made by City staff without a public hearing. 
B.  Process Elements. This chapter sets up rules for procedures, such as pre-application, neighborhood notification, notices and public hearings. It then describes the process for specific land use decisions. The procedures all have a common workflow and description, as follows: 
Table 20.05-1 Process Elements 

The processes established in this Code are summarized below.

Section 20.05.002 - Applications. 
A.  What are the general requirements? 
1.  Applications filed under this chapter must include the information required by Appendix A-4 (Submittal Requirements). All applications shall be made on forms prepared by the City and available in the Planning Division. 
2.  The Council may establish fees for all applications required in this Chapter by resolution. 
B.  How are applications reviewed for completeness? 
1.  An application is not complete until all required items are submitted (see Appendix A-4). 
2.  The City will not process incomplete applications. Review for completeness of application forms is solely to determine whether preliminary information required for submission with the application is sufficient to allow further processing. It does not constitute a decision as to whether an application complies with this chapter. 
3.  Within 15 working days after an application is received, the Administrator shall determine whether the application is complete and send a written notice of the determination to the applicant. The Administrator shall specify those parts of the application that are incomplete and will indicate how they can be made complete. The Administrator and the decision making agency are not obligated to further review the application until the required information is provided. 
a.  If the Administrator determines that the application is still not complete, the applicant may appeal that determination to the City Council by filing a written notice of appeal with the Administrator. The notice of appeal shall be filed within 10 days after the Administrator's determination. The City Council shall issue a written determination on the appeal within 60 days after receipt of the notice of appeal. 
4.  Nothing in this section precludes an applicant and the City from mutually agreeing to an extension of any time limit provided by this section. 
C.  Concurrent Processing. 
1.  In order to facilitate the development process, the following applications may be submitted and processed concurrently: 
a.  Rezonings; 
b.  Annexations; 
c.  Conditional use permits; 
d.  Tentative maps; 
e.  Parcel maps; 
f.  Variances; and 
g.  Major deviations. 
2.  Multiple applications submitted for a single development project may be processed concurrently to allow for an expedited review and processing schedule for a project. The time frame and approval process for a consolidated application shall follow the longest time frame and approval process required from among the multiple applications. For example, multiple applications for zoning map amendment and Conditional Use Permit may be processed concurrently, in which case both applications would be considered based on the more extensive zoning map amendment procedure, and the City Council would be the final decision body on both applications unless otherwise provided by law.

Chapter 20.06 - NONCONFORMITIES 
    Purpose: Applying new regulations to existing development can create situations where existing lot dimensions, development density or intensity, land uses, buildings, structures, landscaping, parking areas, signs or other conditions do not strictly comply with the new requirements. This chapter protects and regulates nonconforming uses, buildings, structures, and lots (referred to collectively as "nonconformities"), and specifies the circumstances and conditions under which those nonconformities may continue. The City finds that nonconformities that adversely affect the orderly development and value of other property in the neighborhood or district should not continue unless restricted. At the same time, reinvestment in some properties that do not strictly comply with current regulations can maintain existing neighborhood assets and economic growth, and is allowed with appropriate conditions. For existing lots or development (including uses, buildings, structures, and signs) that are "legally nonconforming," this chapter sets out fair rules for whether, when, and how the regulations of this title apply. 

Section 20.06.001 - Types of nonconformities. 
A.  There are four types of nonconformities addressed by this chapter: 
Nonconforming Use See Section 20.06.003 Nonconforming Lot See Section 20.06.004 Substandard Development See Section 20.06.005 Projects in Process See Section 20.06.007  
  
B.  Unlawful Uses. This chapter does not excuse, authorize or legitimize uses, buildings, structures, parcels, or signs that were used, erected or maintained in violation of any previous zoning, subdivision or building regulation or otherwise not legally established or constructed. Those uses, buildings, structures, or signs are not "legally" nonconforming, but instead remain unlawful and subject to all requirements of this title (including enforcement provisions) and any other applicable law. 
(Ord. 2512, § 1(Exh. A), Add. 08/24/2015) 
Section 20.06.002 - Right to continue a nonconformity. 
A.  Prior rights. This chapter does not terminate any uses, site requirements or other adjustments authorized under the provisions of any ordinance that was repealed, and does not excuse any violation of those ordinances. 
B.  Right to Continue a Nonconforming Use. A nonconforming use may continue under the provisions of this chapter unless it becomes a public nuisance or is deemed abandoned (see below). 
(Ord. 2512, § 1(Exh. A), Add. 08/24/2015) 
Section 20.06.003 - Nonconforming use. 
A.  Applicability. A "nonconforming use" means any use of land which was lawfully established prior to the adoption of this title or amendments thereto, which would not be permitted under the current provisions of this title. This includes any use which was lawfully established without a discretionary review, and would require that review under the current provisions of this title. 
B.  Abandonment of Nonconforming Uses. 
1.  Abandonment is any cessation of a use regardless of intent to resume the use. In considering whether a use is abandoned, the Administrator shall consider any combination of the following: 
a.  Failure to maintain regular business hours, typical or normal for the use; 
b.  Failure to maintain equipment, supplies or stock-in-trade that would be used for the active operation of the use; 
c.  Failure to maintain utilities that would be used for the active operation of the use; 
d.  Failure to pay taxes, including but not limited to sales tax, workers' compensation taxes, corporate taxes that would be required for the active operation of the use; 
e.  Failure to maintain required local, state or federal licenses or other approvals that would be required for the active operation of the use; 
f.  Failure to maintain applicable business license(s); and 
g.  Other relevant evidence. 
2.  If a nonconforming use ceases for a continuous period of more than two years, or is superseded by a permitted use for a period of at least two years, the nonconforming use is deemed abandoned and shall not be reestablished. 
C.  Enlargement of Nonconforming Uses. 
1.  A nonconforming use shall not be extended or enlarged by more than ten of percent the area lawfully occupied by the nonconforming use as of the date on which it became nonconforming, except by conditional use permit. The enlargement of the nonconforming use shall not extend onto an additional parcel. 
2.  Any enlargement of a nonconforming use not requiring a conditional use permit shall obtain administrative review. 
Section 20.06.004 - Nonconforming lots. 
A.  Nonconforming lots. Any lot or parcel of record as of April 1, 1977, which fails to meet the current requirements for lot area or width or both, may be developed for any use permitted in the zoning district in which it is classified if all other applicable requirements of the title are satisfied. 
(Ord. 2512, § 1(Exh. A), Add. 08/24/2015) 
Section 20.06.005 - Substandard development. 
A.  Applicability. Substandard development means a lawfully improved lot or parcel, including any structure thereupon, which does not satisfy the current provisions of this title regarding parking, landscaping, signs, or other site development standards including building height, building design, setbacks or other dimensional standards. 
1.  Alteration, extension or expansion. A structural alteration, including an extension or expansion of a nonconforming structure is allowed if it: 
a.  Does not increase the applicable nonconformity; and 
b.  Does not involve or create a nonconforming use or substandard development. 
B.  Maintenance, Repairs and Alterations. Routine maintenance of nonconforming structures is permitted, including necessary non-structural repairs, paint, and incidental alterations which do not extend or intensify the nonconfomity. 
C.  Right to Continue a Substandard Development. A substandard development may continue to be occupied and used for any purpose permitted by this title unless it becomes a public nuisance or is damaged or destroyed as provided in this title. 
D.  Intensification of a Substandard Development. 
1.  Intensification of a substandard development (order "intensify") is any: 
a.  Increase in lot coverage; 
b.  increase in building floor area; or 
c.  Increase in building height. 
2.  A substandard development shall not intensify unless the incremental changes and/or additions meet the current requirements of this title, except as provided below. 
3.  If the development is substandard as to parking, the intensification is not allowed unless the entire development provides at least 75 percent of the currently required parking. 
4.  If the development is substandard as to landscaping, the intensification is not allowed unless the entire development provides at least 65 percent of the currently required landscaping. 
5.  If development is unable to meet the requirements of this section, the changes or enlargements to a substandard development may be approved through a conditional use permit when the proposed changes are not detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare. 
(Ord. 2512, § 1(Exh. A), Add. 08/24/2015) 
Section 20.06.006 - Damage or destruction. 
A.  Applicability. This section applies to the destruction or damage of any nonconforming use, nonconforming structure or substandard development. 
B.  Up to 50 Percent. Any destruction or damage less than 50 percent of the replacement value of the use, structure or development may be repaired or replaced at any time. 
C.  Greater Than 50 Percent. 
1.  Any destruction or damage to an extent greater than 50 percent of the replacement value of the use, structure or development may be repaired or replaced within two years after it is destroyed or damaged. 
2.  If use, structure or development is not repaired or replaced within this time period, it may not be repaired or replaced unless it is made to conform to the current requirements of this title. 
(Ord. 2512, § 1(Exh. A), Add. 08/24/2015) 
Section 20.06.007 - Applications in progress. 
A.  Applicability. 
1.  This subsection applies to any application in progress, defined as applications for zoning approval that were filed before this title, or an amendment to this title that affects the application, became effective. 
2.  An application in progress is not considered legally nonconforming, except as provided below. The application is subject to all applicable provisions of this title when the application was filed and while it is being processed, unless otherwise provided in an ordinance amending this title. 
3.  Effect on existing building permits. Nothing in this title requires a change in plans, construction, or designated use of any building or structure for which a building permit was lawfully issued prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this title, if construction was commenced and completed within the time period required by the building code. If the building code does not establish a time period for construction, construction must be commenced within 180 days and completed within two years after issuance of the building permit. 
B.  Continuation. The development approval process usually requires a series of steps, and applications are subject to any conditions provided in an earlier step in the approval process as set out in this Chapter 20.05. An approved application normally does not created a legal nonconformity or vested rights. However, in consideration of existing, good faith investments in project approvals, the City will continue to process existing applications as follows: 
Table B-1 Conditions on Existing Approvals 
Type of Application Conditions or Continuation 1. Annexation - 
Rezoning - An approved application is not considered legally nonconforming unless that applicant has obtained vested rights under Nevada law, or to the extent provided in an enforceable development agreement. 2. Appeal - 
Conditional Use Permit - 
Variance - 
Administrative Review -  All development consistent with the decision is subject to the regulations in effect at the time of the application if a building permit or certificate of occupancy (if no building permit is required) is issued within 1 year of the final decision, and development timely proceeds pursuant to the building permit or certificate of occupancy, or 
 If development does not timely proceed as set out above, the rules in row 1 above apply.  
  
C.  Buildings Under Construction. A building legally under construction that does not comply with this title becomes substandard when this title or an amendment becomes effective. 
D.  Appeal. 
1.  If the rules above do not apply, the applicant may file an appeal with the City Council. 
2.  The City Council may, on appeal, allow the application to proceed if it finds that the applicant has vested rights under Nevada law.
