Cats
[Adopted 9-8-1998 by L.L. No. 9-1998]
§ 5-18. Intent; community cat program. [Amended 4-15-2019 by
L.L. No. 1-2019]
The Village of Brockport Board of Trustees recognizes that state law
preempts the Village from regulating cats that are lost, strayed, homeless
and/or abandoned pursuant to New York Agriculture and Markets Law
Chapter 26 regulating said animals. The Board further recognizes that the
Agriculture and Markets Law does encourage municipalities to promote
humane population control programs for said animals. Therefore, the Board
finds and declares that a community cat program is an effective method
to both care for and meet the public's desire to see community cats cared
for in a humane manner. It improves neighborhood tranquility and public
health, while at the same time reducing the number of community cats,
"nuisance" complaints, impound and killing, and wasteful expenditures of
public and private resources.
§ 5-19. Definitions. [Amended 4-15-2019 by L.L. No. 1-2019]

COMMUNITY CAT CARETAKER  A person who provides care to one
or more community cats. However, community cat caregivers are not the

COMMUNITY CAT PROGRAM  The nonlethal process of humanely
trapping, sterilizing, vaccinating for rabies, ear-tipping, and releasing
community cats to their habitats .
EAR-TIPPING  The removal of the one-fourth-inch tip of a community cat's
left ear, performed while the cat is under anesthesia in compliance with
any applicable federal or state law and under the supervision of a licensed
veterinarian.
STERILIZE  To spay or neuter a cat to render it incapable of reproduction.
TRAP, NEUTER, VACCINATE, AND RETURN or TNVR or TNR  A program
in which community cats are humanely trapped, evaluated, vaccinated,
sterilized, and ear tipped by a veterinarian and returned to the trap location
with the intent of humanely controlling or reducing feline population and
reproduction.
VETERINARIAN  A person licensed to practice veterinary medicine in the
State of New York.

but not mandated to be, resocialized and put up for adoption.
H. It shall not be a violation of this section to determine that the best

ARTICLE I
Legislative Intent
§ 13-1. Need for standards.
As local government becomes increasingly complex and as our democratic
processes draw citizens from every walk of life, there is increasing need for
standards of ethical conduct as a guide for public officers. These standards
must rest primarily on personal integrity and on community vigilance; law
cannot in itself create moral fiber, nor can law quicken the civic conscience.
In support of these basic standards, it is the purpose of this chapter to
define areas of conflicts of interest in Village transactions. This chapter
has as its purpose the protection of the public from municipal contracts
influenced by avaricious officers, and to protect public officers from
unwarranted assaults on their integrity.
§ 13-2. Purpose of Board of Ethics.
The establishment by this chapter of a Board of Ethics as an arm of Village
government, together with standards of ethical conduct, is intended to
provide honest, efficient government to the citizens of the Village of
Brockport.
§ 13-3. Purpose of Code of Ethics.
The primary purpose of this Code of Ethics is to provide a formula of
conduct which is not only clear but reasonable and which will permit
governmental employees to share the normal benefits of the democratic
society and economy they serve and to attract and hold competent
administrators.

person serving the Village or any agency thereof without compensation
shall not be deemed to be in violation of this chapter unless such
interest is in conflict with the proper discharge of his official duties.
B. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to the designation of a

agent or other investment in the funds of the Village in which the
municipal officer or employee has an interest by reason of stock

COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION PROGRAM
§ 13A-1. Legislative findings; intent and purpose; authority.
§ 13A-2. Definitions.
For purposes of this chapter, and unless otherwise expressly stated or
unless the context otherwise requires, the terms in this chapter shall have
A. It is the policy of both the Village of Brockport ("Municipality") and the
State of New York to reduce costs and provide price certainty for the
purpose of consumer protection and economic development, to expand
access and opportunities for consumers in retail energy markets, as
well as to promote the sustainability and resilience of energy systems
through the proliferation of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and
distributed energy resources (DER, as defined below). Among the
initiatives that may advance these objectives in New York is community
choice aggregation (CCA), a policy that empowers local governments to
determine the source of electricity and/or natural gas supply on behalf
of its residents and small businesses, reflecting local resources,
priorities, and challenges. Energy delivery remains the responsibility of
the distribution utility.
B. This chapter establishes the authority for the Village of Brockport, in
connection with the implementation of a CCA program, to acquire
utility data, to select, through competitive solicitation, energy
supplier(s) on behalf of default consumers within the jurisdictional
boundaries of the Village, and to maximize value for participating
consumers through enhanced services related to DER. The municipality
may choose to collaborate with other local governments to form an
intermunicipal program. As a result, consumers will have the
opportunity to lower and stabilize their energy costs, to spur local clean
energy innovation and investment, and to reduce their environmental
impact; thereby fulfilling the purposes of this chapter and fulfilling an
important public purpose.
C. The Village of Brockport is authorized to implement this Community
Choice Aggregation Program pursuant to § 10(l)(ii)(a)(l2) of the New
York Municipal Home Rule Law; and consistent with State of New York
Public Service Commission Case No. 14-M-0224, Proceeding on Motion
of the Commission to Enable Community Choice Aggregation Programs
(issued April 21, 2016) as may be amended, including subsequent
orders of the Public Service Commission issued in connection with or
related to Case No. 14-M-0224, to the extent that orders related to Case
No. 14-M-0224 enable actions by the municipality.
D. This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Community
Choice Aggregation Program Law of the Village of Brockport."

months by service and rate class.
CCA ADMINISTRATOR  The third party duly authorized to request
aggregated and customer-specific data, competitively solicit suppliers for
the aggregated demand for electricity and/or natural gas on behalf of

service pursuant to a special rate, or are new residents of the municipality.
Consumers within opt-out eligible service classes, as of the date the supply
contract goes into effect, taking service from an ESCO, those that have
placed a freeze or block on their account, and those for whom enrollment in
the CCA program would interfere with a choice they have already made to
take service pursuant to a special rate are not considered default consumers
and will not be enrolled on an opt-out basis. For the avoidance of doubt,
all default consumers must reside or be otherwise located at one or more
locations within the geographic boundaries of the municipality, as such
boundaries exist as of the date the supply contract with the goes into effect.
DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES (DER)  Local renewable energy
projects, community-distributed generation (e.g., shared solar), peak

PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION or PSC  New York State Public Service
Commission.
SUPPLIER  An ESCO that procures electric power and natural gas for
participating consumers in connection with this chapter or, alternatively,

§ 13A-3. Authorization of community choice aggregation program.
A. A community choice aggregation program is hereby authorized by the
Municipality, whereby the municipality may implement a CCA program
to the full extent permitted by the PSC CCA order, as set forth more
fully herein.
B. The municipality may enter into contracts with one or more suppliers
for electric and/or natural gas supply and other services on behalf of
default consumers.
C. The municipality may enter into agreements and contracts with other
municipalities, nonprofits, consultants, and/or other third parties to:

(2) Act as CCA administrator; and/or
(3) Develop offers of opt-in DER products and services to participating
consumers.
D. The operation and ownership of the utility service shall remain with the
distribution utility. The municipality's participation in a CCA program
constitutes neither the purchase of a public utility system, nor the
furnishing of utility service. The municipality shall not take over any
part of the electric or gas transmission or distribution system and will

relating to the eligibility of participating ESCOs, the operation by which
ESCOs provide energy services, and the terms on which customers may
be enrolled with ESCOs.
A. All default consumers shall be enrolled on an opt-out basis. Default
consumers will have the right to opt out before the supply contract goes
into effect, or disenroll any time thereafter with no penalty. Those that

ARTICLE III
Variance Procedure
§ 20-32. Variance procedure; Appeals Board.
A. The Zoning Board of Appeals as established by the Village of Brockport
shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter.
B. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination
made by the local administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
C. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals may
appeal such decision to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article 78 of the
Civil Practice Law and Rules.
D. In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage, and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan
and floodplain management program of that area;
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
(10) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with
conducting search and rescue operations during periods of
flooding;
§ 20-32 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 20-32
1:121
§ 20-33. Conditions for variances.
(11) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
(12) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including search and rescue operations,
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.
E. Upon consideration of the factors of § 20-32D and the purposes of this
chapter, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
this chapter.
F. The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions,
including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, provided that the items in
§ 20-32D(1) through (12) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as
a historic structure and that the variance is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D, E and F of this section are met;
and
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.
D. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
§ 20-32 BROCKPORT CODE § 20-33
1:122
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
G. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written notice,
over the signature of a community official, that:
(1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance
coverage; and
(2) Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life
and property.
H. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance
actions as required in § 20-21A of this chapter.

ARTICLE I
Policy
§ 26-1. Declaration of policy.
By authority of resolution adopted by the Village of Brockport, pursuant to
the provisions of Article 6-A of the Village Law, the Planning Board has the
power and authority to approve plats for subdivisions within the Village of
Brockport.14
It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Village of Brockport Planning
Board to consider land subdivisions as part of a plan for the orderly, efficient
and economical development of the Village. Land to be subdivided shall be
of such character that it can be used for building purposes without danger
to health or peril from fire, flood or other menace. Proper provision shall
be made for drainage, water, sewerage and other needed improvements.
The proposed streets and development shall compose a convenient street
system and shall be properly related to the Official Map and/or the Master
Plan of the Village of Brockport, as either may be adopted or accepted as
guides for the future development of the Village. Streets shall be of such
widths, grade and location as to accommodate the prospective traffic, to
afford adequate light and air, and to facilitate fire protection. In proper
cases, park areas of suitable location, size and character for playground or
other recreational purposes shall be shown on the subdivision plat.
Should any of this chapter conflict or be inconsistent with any provision of
the Village Law, such provision of the Village Law shall apply.
In order that land may be subdivided in accordance with this policy, those
regulations are hereby adopted.

ARTICLE II
Procedure for Filing Subdivision Applications
§ 26-2. Procedures to be followed. [Amended 5-6-2002 by L.L. No.
1-2002]
Whenever any subdivision of land is proposed, before any contract for
the sale of any part thereof, and before any permit for the erection of a
structure in such proposed subdivision shall be granted, the subdividing
owner or his authorized agent shall apply for the secure approval of such
proposed subdivision in accordance with the following procedures, which
may include up to three steps:
§ 26-3. Preliminary layout.
A. Conceptual review.
B. Preliminary layout.
C. Subdivision plat.
A. Discussion or requirements. Before preparing the preliminary layout,
the applicant may discuss with the Planning Board or its representative
the requirements for reservations of land, street improvements,
drainage, sewerage, water, fire protection and similar aspects, as well
as the availability of existing services. The applicant should also discuss
the preliminary layout with the State Health Department or other
pertinent health agencies whose approval is required by this chapter
and which must eventually approve any subdivision plat coming within
its jurisdiction.
B. Application procedure. Prior to filing an application for the approval of
a subdivision plat, the applicant shall file an application for the approval
of a preliminary layout and shall retain competent engineering and
legal counsel for technical matters and provide the necessary detailed
information. The application shall: [Amended 12-7-1970]
(1) Be made on forms available at the office of the Village
Administrator.
(2) Include all land which the applicant proposes to subdivide.
(3) Be accompanied by three copies of the preliminary layout, as
described in § 26-16 of this chapter, a copy of which shall be
submitted to the Village Engineer at least two weeks prior to the
regularly scheduled Planning Board meeting for its review.
[Amended 12-7-1970]
§ 26-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 26-3
1:151
(4) Comply in all respects with Article III of this chapter and with the
provisions of §§ 178 and 179 of the Village Law,15 except where a
modification may be specifically authorized by the Planning Board.
(5) Be presented to the Chairman of the Planning Board.
(6) Be accompanied by a minimum fee of $100, plus $50 for each
additional lot. [Amended 1-19-1987 by L.L. No. 1-1987;

(a) Unscheduled Planning Board meeting by special request: $50.
(b) For subdivision plat housing developments of more than 70
units in size, the fee structure is calculated as in § 26-3B(6) but
may be paid in three installments, each consisting of 1/3 of the
total amount due on the application. The schedule of payments
shall coincide with the three phases of plan development, and
each payment shall be due prior to the meeting that begins
each phase of the Planning Board plan approval process:
[1] Phase I: Conceptual review;
[2] Phase II: Preliminary layout; and
[3] Phase III: Subdivision plat.
C. Applicant to attend Planning Board meeting. The applicant should then
be prepared to attend the next regular meeting of the Planning Board to
discuss the preliminary layout.
D. Study of preliminary layout. The Planning Board will carefully study the
practicability of the preliminary layout, taking into consideration the
requirements of the community and the best use of the land being
subdivided. Particular attention will be given to the arrangement,
location and width of streets, their relation to the topography of the
land, sewage disposal, drainage, lot sizes and arrangement, the future
development of adjoining lands as yet unsubdivided, and the
requirements of the Village of Brockport Master Plan and the Official
Map.
E. Required changes for tentative approval. After discussion of the
preliminary layout, the Planning Board will advise the applicant, in
writing, of the specific changes it will require in the layout, and the
character and extent of required improvements and reservations which
it will require as a prerequisite to the approval of the subdivision plat.
This shall constitute tentative approval of the preliminary layout.
F. Where an application has been received for a new one-lot subdivision
on existing public services, or for a lot resubdivision, the Planning
Board authorizes the Building Inspector for the Village of Brockport to
take such application and, if he is satisfied that appropriate zoning

regulations are met and that all public services, i.e., water, sewer and
road, do service this property, he may grant tentative approval of the
preliminary layout on behalf of the Planning Board. With such approval,
the applicant may then file directly with the Planning Board for final
approval after the mandatory public hearing. [Added 3-1-1976 by L.L.
No. 3-1976]
G. The purpose of the above new subsection is to simplify the subdivision

property exists in an improved section of the Village. [Added 3-1-1976
by L.L. No. 3-1976]
A. Application procedure. Within six months of the tentative approval of

an application for approval of a subdivision plat. The application shall:
(1) Be made on forms provided by the Planning Board at the time of
tentative approval of the preliminary layout.

construction detail sheets, as described in § 26-17 of this chapter.

officially submitted only at the regular meeting of the Planning Board
following completion of the application procedure outlined above.
C. Endorsement of State Health Department. The proposed subdivision
plat shall be properly endorsed by the State Health Department, or
other pertinent health agency, as meeting the standards of the State
Sanitary Code or other applicable health code before any public hearing
is scheduled. The plat should be in final form before State Health
Department or other health agency approval.
D. County Official Map notification. The Planning Board shall also, when
and if Monroe County establishes a County Official Map, notify the
County Planning Board or Commission, if any, and the County
Superintendent of Highways if the subdivision plat proposes structures
or new streets having frontage on, access to or is otherwise directly
§ 26-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 26-4
1:153
related to any county road, existing or proposed, as shown on the
County Official Map, when and if established. The County Planning
Board or Commission shall report to the Village Planning Board within
30 days on its approval or disapproval, or on its approval subject to
stated conditions, of the subdivision plat. The plat may be approved
by the Village Planning Board subject to stated conditions,
notwithstanding such report, when the application of such report will
act so as to deprive the owner of the reasonable use of his land.
E. Public hearing. Before the Planning Board acts on any subdivision plat,
it shall hold a public hearing thereon, in accordance with Village Law
§ 7-728. [Amended 11-19-1973]
F. Action on proposed subdivision plat. After careful study, the Planning
Board may, within 45 days from the official submittal date of the
subdivision plat, approve, modify or disapprove such plat. The grounds
for disapproval of any plat shall be stated on the records of the Planning
Board. A subdivision plat shall not be signed by the authorized officers
of the Planning Board until the applicant has met all the conditions of
the action granting approval of such plat.
G. Plat void if revised after approval. No changes, erasures, modifications
or revisions shall be made in any subdivision plat after approval has
been given by the Board and endorsed, in writing, on the plat. In the
event that any subdivision plat when recorded contains any such
changes, the plat shall be considered null and void, and the Board shall
institute proceedings to have said plat stricken from the records of the
County Clerk.
H. Signing of plat. [Amended 12-7-1970]
(1) Every subdivision plat submitted to the Board for its approval shall
carry the following endorsement:
Approved by resolution of the Planning Board of the Village of
Brockport, New York, on the __________ day of __________, _____,

§ 26-5. Required improvements and agreements.
(2) In the absence of the Chairman or Secretary, the Acting Chairman
or Acting Secretary, respectively, may sign in his place.

the applicant shall be required to post a performance bond (backed up
with a letter of credit or surety bond or certified check) which is
available to the Village in sufficient amount to assure such completion
of all required improvements. This bond shall be for a period of one
year, to be renewed at the end of that time if improvements are not
completed. After the improvements are in and approved by the Village,
the applicant shall be required to post a maintenance bond for two
years in the amount of 10% of the cost of such improvements. Such
performance bond shall comply with the requirements of Village Law
§ 7-730, and shall be satisfactory to the Village Board as to form,
sufficiency and manner of execution. All required improvements shall
be made by the applicant at his expense without reimbursement by the
Village. [Amended 12-7-1970; 11-19-1973]
B. Inspection of improvements. The Village shall employ an inspector to
act as agent of the Planning Board for the purpose of assuring the
satisfactory completion of improvements required by the Planning
Board and shall determine an amount sufficient to defray costs of
inspection. The applicant shall pay the Village costs of inspection before
the subdivision plat is signed for filing. If the Planning Board or its
agent finds, upon inspection, that any of the required improvements
have not been constructed in accordance with the approved
construction detail sheets, the applicant and the bonding company will
be severally and jointly liable for the costs of completing said
improvements according to specifications.
C. Utilities. As to utilities required by the Planning Board, the Board may
accept assurance from each public utility company whose facilities are
proposed to be installed. Such assurance shall be in writing, addressed
to the Board, stating that such public utility company will make the
installation necessary for the furnishing of its services within a
specified time, in accordance with the approved construction detail
sheets.

subdivision plat, the plat shall be properly signed by the appropriate officers
of the Planning Board and shall be filed by the applicant in the office of the
County Clerk. Any subdivision plat not so filed within 90 days of the date of

acceptance by the Village of any street, park, playground or other open
space shown on said plat. The Planning Board may require said plat to be
endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect. The Planning Board may
also require the filing of a written agreement between the applicant and

NOTE: Street classification as indicated on the Village Master Plan
or the Official Map, as it may be adopted, or as determined by the
Planning Board. Standards are not shown for arterial streets, as
they would be built by the state or county in all probability.
C. Relation to topography. Streets shall be logically related to the
topography, and all streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as
possible of the building sites at or above the grades of the streets.
Grades of streets shall conform as closely as possible to the original
topography. A combination of steep grades and sharp curves shall be
avoided.
D. Block size. Within any zoning district, block dimensions shall be at least
twice the minimum lot depth and generally not more than 12 times the
minimum lot width. In long blocks, the Planning Board may require the
renovation through the block of a twenty-foot-wide easement to
accommodate utilities or pedestrian traffic. See § 26-14.
E. Intersections. Intersections of arterial streets by other streets shall be
at least 800 feet apart, if possible. Cross-street (four-cornered)
intersections shall be avoided insofar as possible, except at important
traffic intersections. A distance of at least 150 feet shall be maintained
between offset intersections. Within 40 feet of an intersection, streets
shall be approximately at right angles and grades shall be limited to
1 1/2%. All street-intersection corners shall be rounded by curves of at
least 30 feet in radius at the property line. Within triangular areas
formed by the intersecting street lines, for a distance of 75 feet from
their intersection and the diagonals connecting the end points of those
lines, visibility for traffic safety shall be provided by excavating, if
necessary. Nothing in the way of fences, walls, hedges or other
landscaping shall be permitted to obstruct such visibility. [Amended
12-7-1970]
F. Continuation of streets into adjacent property. The arrangement of
streets shall provide for the continuation of principal streets between
adjacent properties where such continuation is necessary for
convenient movement of traffic, effective fire protection, efficient
provision of utilities and particularly where such continuation is in
accordance with the Village Plan. If the adjacent property is
undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the
right-of-way and improvements shall be extended to the property line. A
temporary circular turnaround of a minimum of 60 feet in radius shall
be provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with the notation on the
§ 26-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 26-11
1:159
§ 26-12. Improvements. [Amended 12-7-1970; 1-19-1987 by L.L. No.
1-1987]
Street improvements. Streets shall be graded and improved with pavement,
street signs, streetlighting standards, curbs, gutters, street trees, water
mains, sanitary sewers, storm drains, fire hydrants and sidewalks, except
that waivers may be requested and the Planning Board may waive, subject
to appropriate conditions, such improvements as it considers are not
requisite in the interest of public health, safety and general welfare. If
placed in the street right-of-way, underground utilities required by the
Planning Board shall be placed between the paved roadway and the street
line to simplify the location and repair of the lines. The subdivider shall
install underground service connections to the property line of each lot
before the street is paved. Such grading and improvements shall conform
to the Village minimum road specifications and shall be approved as to
design and specifications by the Village Engineer. The developer, before the
approval of the final subdivision plat, shall complete all improvements to the
satisfaction of the Village Engineer and post a performance bond sufficient
to insure the satisfactory completion of such improvements.
§ 26-13. Lots.
plat that land outside the street right-of-way shall revert to abutters
whenever the street is continued. The Planning Board may limit
temporary dead-end streets to a length not more than double the
permitted length of permanent dead-end streets. [Amended
12-7-1970]
G. Permanent dead-end streets. Where a street does not extend to the
boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not needed for
access to adjoining property, it shall be separated from such boundary
by a distance not less than the average lot depth of the proposed lots on
the street. Reserve strips of land shall not be left between the end of a
proposed street and an adjacent piece of property. However, the
Planning Board may require the reservation of a twenty-foot-wide
easement to accommodate pedestrian traffic or utilities. A circular
turnaround of a minimum right-of-way radius of 65 feet shall be
provided at the end of a permanent dead-end street. For greater
convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire protection,
permanent dead-end streets shall, in general, be limited in length to six
times the minimum lot width for the zoning district.
H. Street names. All streets shall be named, and such names shall be
subject to the approval of the Planning Board. Names shall be
sufficiently different in sound and in spelling from other street names in
the Village so as not to cause confusion. A street which is a continuation
of an existing street shall bear the same name.
A. Lot arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be
no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other
§ 26-11 BROCKPORT CODE § 26-13
1:160
§ 26-14. Reservations and easements.
conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots in
compliance with the Zoning Ordinance,17 and in providing access to
buildings on such lots from an approved street.
B. Access across a watercourse. Where a watercourse separates the
buildable area of a lot from the street by which it has access, provision
shall be made for installation of a culvert or other structure of design
approved by the Village Engineer. [Amended 12-7-1970]
C. Lot dimensions. Lot dimensions shall at the least comply with the
minimum standards of the Zoning Ordinance. Where lots are more than
double the minimum required area for the zoning district, the Planning
Board may require that such lots be arranged so as to allow further
subdivision and the opening of future streets where they would be
necessary to serve such potential lots.
D. Side lot lines. Side lot lines may be at right angles to street lines or at an
angle no smaller than 55° as measured from the street line.
E. Access from major streets. Lots shall not, in general, derive access
exclusively from a major street. Where driveway access from a major
street may be necessary for several adjoining lots, the Planning Board
may require that such lots be served by a combined access drive in
order to limit possible traffic hazards on such street.
A. Parks and playgrounds. The Planning Board may require adequate,
convenient and suitable areas for parks and playgrounds, or other
recreational purposes, to be reserved on the plat, but in no case more
than 10% of the gross area of any subdivision. The area shall be shown
and marked on the plat "Reserved for Park or Playground Purposes."
B. Widening or realignment of existing streets. Where the subdivision
borders an existing street, and the Official Map or Master Plan
indicates plans for realignment or widening of the street that would
require reservation of some land of the subdivision, the Planning Board
may require that such areas be shown and marked on the plat
"Reserved for Street Realignment (or Widening) Purposes."
C. Utility and drainage easements. Where topography or other conditions
are such as to make impractical the inclusion of utilities or drainage
facilities within street rights-of-way, perpetual unobstructed easements
at least 20 feet in width for such utilities shall be provided across
property outside the street lines and with satisfactory access to the
street. Easements shall be indicated on the plat.
D. Easements for pedestrian access. The Planning Board, where it deems
necessary, may require, in order to facilitate pedestrian access from
streets to schools, parks, playgrounds or other nearby streets,
17.Editor's Note: See Ch. 58, Zoning.
§ 26-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 26-14
1:161
§ 26-15. Miscellaneous.
perpetual unobstructed easements at least 20 feet in width. Easements
shall be indicated on the plat.
E. Responsibility for ownership of reservations. Ownership shall be clearly
indicated on all reservations for parks and playground purposes.
A. Preservation of existing features. Existing features which would add
value to residential development, such as large trees, watercourses and
falls, beaches, historic spots and similar irreplaceable assets, should be
preserved, insofar as possible, through the harmonious design of the
subdivision.
B. Self-imposed restrictions. The owner may place restrictions on the
development greater than those required by the Zoning Ordinance.18
Such restrictions, if any, shall be indicated on the final plat.
C. Modification of standards. The Planning Board may modify the specified
requirements in any individual case where, in the Board's judgment,
such modification is in the public interest or will avoid the imposition of
unnecessary individual hardship.
D. All development of property is further controlled by the Design Criteria
and Construction Specifications for Land Development adopted by the
Board of Trustees of the Village of Brockport June 10, 1985.19 [Added
12-7-1970; amended 12-16-1985 by L.L. No. 11-1985]

ARTICLE I
Stormwater Management and Erosion and Sediment Control
§ 27-1. Title.
This article shall be known as the "Stormwater Management and Erosion
and Sediment Control Law."
§ 27-2. Introduction; purpose.
A. Land-disturbance activities and associated increases in impervious
cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase
stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion,
and sediment transport and deposition. This stormwater runoff
contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants.
Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and non-point-source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from development sites.
B. During the construction process, soil is the most vulnerable to erosion
by wind and water. This eroded soil endangers water resources by
reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitats for
fish and other desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates
maintenance and/or repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of
waterways. In addition, clearing and/or grading during construction
tends to increase soil erosion and causes the loss of native vegetation
necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitats and to provide a healthy
living environment for citizens of the Village of Brockport. Improper
design and construction of stormwater management practices can
increase the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby increasing stream
bank erosion and sedimentation. Impervious surfaces allow less water
to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing groundwater recharge
and stream baseflow. Regulation of land-disturbance activities by
means of performance standards governing stormwater management
and site design will produce development compatible with the natural
functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby
mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from
development.
C. As a result, the purpose of this local regulation is to safeguard public
health, protect property, prevent damage to the environment and
promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating, and controlling the
design, construction, use, and maintenance of any development or
other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the
movement of earth on land in the Village of Brockport. It seeks to meet
those purposes by achieving the following objectives:
(1) Meet the requirements of Minimum Measures 4 and 5 of the
SPDES General Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Municipal
Separate Stormwater Sewer Systems (MS4s), Permit No. GP-02-02,
or as amended or revised.

or revised.
(3) Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land-disturbance
activities in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream
temperature, and stream bank erosion, and maintain the integrity
of stream channels.
(4) Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from
land-disturbance activities which would otherwise degrade local
water quality.
(5) Minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows
from any specific site during and following development to the
maximum extent practicable.
(6) Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint-

§ 27-20. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY  The activity of an active farm, including
grazing and watering livestock, irrigating crops, harvesting crops, using
land for growing agricultural products, and cutting timber for sale, but
shall not include the operation of a dude ranch or similar operation or the
construction of new structures associated with agricultural activities.
APPLICANT  A property owner or agent of a property owner who has filed
an application for a stormwater management permit.
BUILDING  Any roofed walled structure, either temporary, permanent
and/or vacant, as per the definitions stated in Chapter 58, § 58-2, of the
Code of the Village of Brockport.
A. Land development projects and associated increases in impervious
cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase
stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion,
and sediment transport and deposition. This stormwater runoff
contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants.
Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and non-point-source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from development sites.
B. The purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the
general health, safety and welfare of the public residing in the
watersheds within the Village of Brockport. Therefore, the Village of
Brockport establishes this set of water quality and quantity policies to
provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff
and to, in addition to the above, safeguard persons, protect property,
prevent damage to the environment in the Village of Brockport, and
comply with the NYSDEC State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(SPDES) General Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Municipal
Separate Storm Sewer systems (MS4s), for the purpose of protecting
local water resources from degradation. It is determined that the
regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
projects and other construction activities in order to control and
minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil
erosion, stream channel erosion, and non-point-source pollution
associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will
prevent threats to public health and safety.

(post-construction stormwater runoff control practices), the NYSDEC's
§ 27-21 BROCKPORT CODE § 27-22
1:196
§ 27-23. Legislative authority.
In accordance with Article 21 of the Village Law of the State of New
York, Article 3 of the Municipal Home Rule Law of the State of New York
and Chapter 28 of the Code of the Village of Brockport, the Board of
Trustees has the authority to enact laws for the purpose of promoting the
health, safety or general welfare of the Village of Brockport, including the
protection and preservation of the property of its inhabitants. By the same
authority, the Board of Trustees may include in any such law provisions for
the authorizing of any municipal employees and/or agent of the Village of
Brockport to effectuate and administer such law.
§ 27-24. Compliance; required submissions.
technical standards are detailed in the New York State Stormwater
Management Design Manual.
A. No person(s) shall receive any building, grading or other landdisturbance
approvals or permits required for land-disturbance
activities without first meeting the requirements of this article to the
satisfaction of the Village of Brockport. Unless specifically excluded by
this article, any landowner or operator desiring approval or a permit for
a land-disturbance activity shall comply with all applicable provisions of
this article and shall submit all required plans, documentation and
information as required under this article to the Village of Brockport for
review and approval.
B. Unless otherwise accepted by this article, the following items shall be
submitted prior to the issuance of a permit or site plan approval:
(1) Stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) (§ 27-27).
(2) Maintenance easement(s) (see § 27-28A).
(3) Maintenance agreement(s) (see § 27-28B).
C. The SWPPP shall be prepared to meet the requirements of §§ 27-26
through 27-27 of this article. The maintenance agreement shall be
prepared to meet the requirements of § 27-27 of this article.
D. The SWPPP and all other documents required by this article must be
reviewed by the Village of Brockport to ensure that established water
quality standards will be maintained after development of the site and
that post-construction runoff levels are consistent with any local and
regional watershed plans. Information shall be submitted as a single,
logical package, with all information bound together.
E. The Planning Board shall review said application in conjunction with
any subdivision and site plan review pursuant to Chapter 26, Land
Subdivision Regulations.
§ 27-22 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 27-24
1:197
§ 27-25. Waivers and mitigation requirements.
F. In situations where application is made after approval (for example an
approved site plan or subdivision approved prior to the enactment of
this article), the application shall be reviewed by the Planning Board as
a change or modification to the approved plan.
A. All person(s) shall comply with the requirements of this article, unless a
written request is filed to waive the requirements in part or whole for
land-disturbance activities that disturb less than one acre of land.
Requests to waive any requirements of this article shall be submitted to
the Village of Brockport for approval.
B. The minimum requirements for stormwater management may be
waived in whole or in part upon written request of the applicant,
provided that at least one of the following conditions applies:
(1) It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely
to impair attainment of the objectives of this article.
(2) Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of
stormwater discharges have been established in a stormwater
pollution prevention plan that has been approved by the Village of
Brockport, and the implementation of the plan is required by local
law. These practices are encouraged in order to minimize the
reliance on structural practices. Credit in the form of reductions in
the amount of stormwater that must be managed can be earned
through the use of nonstructural practices that reduce the
generation of stormwater from the site. These nonstructural
practices are explained in detail in the manual Better Site Design:
A Handbook for Changing Development Rules in Your Community.
Applicants wishing to obtain credit for use of nonstructural
practices must ensure that these practices are documented and
remain unaltered by subsequent property owners.
(3) Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility.
The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and
adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is
equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site
practices, and there is a legally obligated entity responsible for
long-term operation and maintenance of the stormwater practice.
(4) The Village of Brockport finds that meeting the minimum on-site
management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or
existing physical characteristics of a site.
(5) Nonstructural practices will be used on the site that reduce:
(a) The generation of stormwater from the site.
(b) The size and cost of stormwater storage.
§ 27-24 BROCKPORT CODE § 27-25
1:198
§ 27-26. General design and performance criteria for stormwater
management.
(c) The pollutants generated at the site.
C. In instances where one of the conditions above applies, the Village of
Brockport may grant a waiver from strict compliance with these
stormwater management provisions, as long as acceptable mitigation
measures are provided. However, to be eligible for a waiver, the
applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Village of
Brockport that the waiver will not result in the following impacts to
downstream waterways:
(1) Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams and other
structures.
(2) Degradation of biological functions or habitats.
(3) Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion or siltation.
(4) Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, property.
D. No waivers or mitigation plans will be considered for land-disturbance
activity that disturbs one acre or greater of land.
A. Unless judged by the Village of Brockport to be exempted or granted a
waiver per § 27-25, the following performance criteria shall be
addressed for stormwater management at all sites. The applicant shall
consult the Design Criteria, New York State Stormwater Management
Design Manual and the New York Standards and Specifications for
Erosion and Sediment Control for standards and specifications related
to stormwater management design criteria. Stormwater management
practices that are designed and constructed in accordance with these
technical documents shall be presumed to meet the standards imposed
by this article. If there is a conflict between any of the standards, the
more stringent standard shall apply. Where stormwater management
practices are not in accordance with technical standards, the applicant
or developer must demonstrate equivalence to the technical standards
set forth in this § 27-26 and § 27-27 of this article, and the SWPPP shall
be prepared by a licensed/certified professional.
B. The following design and performance criteria shall be addressed for
stormwater management at all sites:
(1) All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices
to control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated
with specified design storms and reduce the generation of
stormwater. These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas
for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater runoff from
driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas
to the maximum extent practicable to provide treatment for both
water quality and quantity.
§ 27-25 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 27-26
1:199
§ 27-27. Stormwater pollution prevention plan requirements.
(2) All stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not
discharge untreated stormwater directly into a jurisdictional
wetland or local water body without adequate treatment. Where
such discharges are proposed, the impact of the proposal on
wetland functional values shall be assessed using a method
acceptable to the Village of Brockport. In no case shall the impact
on functional values be any greater than that allowed by the Army
Corps of Engineers (A.C.E.) or the NYSDEC responsible for natural
resources.
(3) An attempt shall be made to maintain annual groundwater
recharge rates by promoting infiltration through the use of
structural and nonstructural methods. At a minimum, an attempt
shall be made for annual recharge from the post-development site
to mimic the annual recharge from predevelopment site conditions.
(4) In order to protect stream channels from degradation, a specific
channel protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the
Design Criteria and/or the New York State Stormwater
Management Design Manual.
(5) Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources
may be subject to additional performance criteria or may need to
utilize or restrict certain stormwater management practices.
(6) Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher
potential pollutant loadings, known as "hot spots," may require the
use of specific structural stormwater treatment practices and
pollution prevention practices.
(7) Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the Village
of Brockport to determine if they are subject to additional
stormwater design requirements.
(8) The calculations for determining peak flows (WQv,) as found in the
New York State Stormwater Management Design Manual, shall be
used for sizing all stormwater management practices.
A. A SWPPP is required as part of compliance with this article. This plan
must be prepared by a qualified professional and must indicate whether
stormwater will be managed on site or off site, and if on site, the
general location and type of practices, and shall also include sufficient
information (e.g., maps, hydrologic calculations, etc.) to evaluate the
environmental characteristics of the project site, the potential impacts
of all proposed development of the site, both present and future, on the
water resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of the
measures proposed for managing stormwater generated at the project

Loitering
[Adopted 2-21-1994 by L.L. No. 1-199424]
§ 35-1. Legislative intent; findings.
§ 35-2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
LOITER  To stand, lounge, congregate or remain parked in a motor
vehicle at a public place or place open to the public and to engage in any
A. The Board of Trustees of the Village of Brockport makes the following
findings:
(1) There have been numerous citizen complaints directed to the
Mayor and Trustees and other local officials concerning the
incidence of persons gathering in the public area of the Village
without a legitimate reason for being there. Investigations of these
complaints have resulted in the findings that, in the places
complained of, extremely large quantities of refuse, empty
beverage containers and other litter have accumulated. In addition,
it has been recognized and reported that such illegitimate
gatherings have discouraged citizens from legitimate utilization of
these areas.
(2) The complaints received and the investigations show that such
illegitimate gatherings very often are participated in by very large
groups of people and are associated with noise, yelling, often of an
obscene nature, fighting and rowdiness, in addition to the litter.
(3) It is also found that, where this kind of illegitimate gathering
occurs, acts of vandalism have been found to occur and damage to
public and private property has been sustained. It is also found that
the protection of the health, safety and welfare of the community
requires action in the public interest to regulate such behavior.
(4) It is the desire of the Board of Trustees of the Village of Brockport
to encourage and stimulate the use of the downtown area for
everyone. Our beautiful buildings and dedicated merchants will
attract people from all walks of life, and this we support. However,
when the sidewalks and areas in front of stores are used as a
gathering area or playground, and customers and strollers are
deterred, it must be addressed.
B. In order to allow free and unobstructed access to store entrances and
permit all who desire to stroll our wide tree-lined sidewalks without
worry or concern for their safety, we propose the following article.

building permit or suspend the building permit until such time as the
permit holder demonstrates that all work then completed is in
compliance with all applicable provisions of the Uniform Code, Energy

performed shall be in compliance with all applicable provisions of the
Uniform Code, Energy Code and local laws.

initial building permit or renewal building permit. Fee(s) shall be
determined, assessed, administered and enforced by the Code

D. Applications for operating permits. An application for an operating
permit shall be in writing on a form provided by or otherwise
acceptable to the Code Enforcement Officer. Such application shall
include all information as the Code Enforcement Officer deems
sufficient to permit a determination by the Code Enforcement Officer

Officer to be of a temporary nature, consistent with local
conditions. The effective period of the operating permit shall be
specified in the operating permit. Operating permits are renewable
at the expiration of each permit period noted on the permit. It is the
obligation of the owner to order a compliance inspection for the
renewal of the operating permit at least 60 days prior to the
expiration of the operating permit. Failure of the owner to do so
shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and may subject the
owner to the imposition of fines and penalties as are stated in this
chapter or elsewhere and to general jurisdiction fines and penalties

discontinue the use of the property unless or until it again comes
into compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
(3) The Code Enforcement Officer (or his/her authorized inspector)
shall inspect the subject premises prior to the issuance of an

other legal requirements as may apply to permit such inspection(s).

the structure, building or portion thereof that was constructed or was
converted from one use or occupancy classification or subclassification
or had equipment installation or structural alterations complies with all
applicable provisions of the Uniform Code, Energy Code and local laws.

Zoning, of the Code, or any other applicable law, ordinance or rule are
discovered, and those violations are such that the dwelling and/or any
dwelling unit thereof is deemed a structure unfit for human habitation
pursuant to § 36-15 of this chapter, the existing certificate of occupancy
shall become null and void. In that case, the Code Enforcement Officer
shall notify the registered owner(s) that the continued occupancy or use
of the building is forbidden unless a conditional certificate of occupancy
can be obtained as provided in § 36-7B of this chapter.
G. Notwithstanding the existence of a valid certificate of occupancy/

the health or welfare of persons; to the storm drainage system
including but not limited to pipes, manholes, outfall structures and
storm laterals; or to the waters of the United States. If the violator fails

MS4 or waters of the United States or to minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have his or her
MS4 access suspended or terminated if such action would abate or
reduce an illicit discharge. The Village of Brockport will notify a violator
of the proposed suspension or termination of its MS4 access. The
violator may petition the Village of Brockport to reconsider the
suspension or termination of MS4 access by requesting a hearing

to reinstate MS4 access to premises suspended or terminated pursuant
to this section without the prior approval of the Village of Brockport.

imminent threats to the public health and safety; immediate access to
suspected offending facilities is deemed necessary to prevent such
hazardous occurrences.
B. Access to facilities. The Village of Brockport shall be permitted to enter
and inspect, at any time, facilities subject to regulation under this
article as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this
article. If a discharger has security measures in force which require

of this article.
H. If the Village of Brockport has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which a discharge or conveyance to the storm sewer
system exists, and the Village of Brockport is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article or
that there is a need to further inspect and/or sample the private
stormwater system to verify compliance with this article or any order
issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and
welfare of the community, then the Village of Brockport may seek
issuance of an administrative search warrant from any court of
competent jurisdiction.
I. In an emergency situation (imminent hazard and danger to the public
health, safety and welfare), the Village of Brockport may enter the
premises forthwith to inspect and contain the emergency situation and
prevent further hazard to the health and safety of the public; in such
emergency situations, the Village of Brockport may "red tag" the
premises, in which case the use and occupancy of the premises shall
forthwith cease and the premises shall be vacated unless or until there
is an administrative or court order terminating the red tagging and/or
the emergency is otherwise abated and terminated in a manner
satisfactory to the Village of Brockport.
A. Best management practices. The Village of Brockport will adopt
requirements identifying best management practices (BMPs) for any
activity, operation or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution
or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of
the United States. Such BMPs already adopted by any state, federal or
local agency shall be deemed incorporated herein by reference. The
owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at his or her own expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the
municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of

authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity to the maximum extent practicable shall be deemed compliant
with the provisions of this section. Appropriately designed structural/
nonstructural BMPs shall be included as part of a stormwater pollution
prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with
requirements of the SPDES permit.
B. Private sewage disposal systems. Where individual sewage treatment
systems are contributing to the Village of Brockport being subject to the

waste, excessive vegetation and other obstacles that would pollute,
contaminate or significantly retard the flow of water through the
watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing
privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse so that
such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function or
physical integrity of the watercourse.

suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in the
illegal discharges of pollutants into a stormwater MS4, the public or private
storm drain system or waters of the United States, said person shall take
all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment and cleanup of
any such release. In the event a release of hazardous materials occurs,
said person shall immediately notify the appropriate emergency response

throughout. Each stone shall be separate from the next one and the
joints made with tar paper or sand.
B. For the construction of the three lower inches of the cement flagstones,
concrete shall be made in the following proportions in units of volume
of the component parts: one part of portland cement, two parts of sand,
four parts of broken stone or screened gravel. The sand and cement
shall be thoroughly mixed together dry, in a mortar box or platform,
then mixed with water until there is a good mortar; level off the mortar

E. The wooden frames shall not be considered as a part of the finished
walk and shall be removed, except that they may be left at driveways.

§ 48-4. Filing of annual returns.
Every utility subject to tax hereunder shall file annually, on or before the
31st day of January, a return for the calendar year preceding the month of
such return date or any portion thereof for which the tax imposed hereby
is effective; provided, however, that in lieu of the annual return required
by the foregoing provisions, any utility may file quarterly, on or before
March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, a return for the three
calendar months preceding the month of each such return date, and in the
case of the first such return, for all preceding calendar months during which
the tax imposed hereby was effective. Every return shall state the gross
income or gross operating income for the period covered thereby. Returns
shall be filed with the Treasurer on a form to be furnished by him for such
purpose and shall contain such other data, information or matter as he may
require to be included therein. The Treasurer, in order to ensure payment
of the tax imposed, may require at any time a further or supplemental
return, which shall contain any data that may be specified by him, and he
may require any utility doing business in the Village of Brockport to file an
annual return, which shall contain any data specified by him, regardless of
whether the utility is subject to tax under this chapter. Every return shall
have annexed thereto an affidavit of the head of the utility making the same,
or of the owner or of a copartner thereof, or of a principal officer of the
corporation, if such business is conducted by a corporation, to the effect
that the statements contained therein are true.
§ 48-5. Payment of tax.
At the time of filing a return as required by this chapter, each utility shall
pay to the Treasurer the tax imposed by this chapter for the period covered
by such return. Such tax shall be due and payable at the time of filing the
return or, if a return is not filed when due, on the last day on which the
return is required to be filed.
§ 48-6. Insufficient or unsatisfactory returns.
In case any return filed pursuant to this chapter shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the Treasurer, and if a corrected or sufficient return is not
filed within 20 days after the same is required by notice from him, or if no
return is made for any period, the Treasurer shall determine the amount
of tax due from such information as he is able to obtain and, if necessary,
may estimate the tax on the basis of external indices or otherwise. He shall
give notice of such determination to the person liable for such tax. Such
determination shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax, unless the person
against whom it is assessed shall, within 30 days after the giving of notice
of such determination, apply to the Treasurer for a hearing or unless the
Treasurer of his own motion shall reduce the same. After such hearing,
the Treasurer shall give notice of his decision to the person liable for the
tax. Such decision may be reviewed by a proceeding under Article 78 of
the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the State of New York if application
therefor is made within 90 days after the giving of notice of such decision.
§ 48-4 BROCKPORT CODE § 48-6
1:370
An order to review such decision shall not be granted unless the amount of
any tax sought to be reviewed, with interest and penalties thereon, if any,
shall be first deposited with the Treasurer and an undertaking filed with him
in such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme Court
shall approve to the effect that, if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax
confirmed, the applicant will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in
the prosecution of such proceeding or, at the option of the applicant, such
undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to cover the tax, interest, penalties,
costs and charges aforesaid, in which event the applicant shall not be
required to pay such tax, interest and penalties as a condition precedent
to the granting of such order. Except in the case of a willfully false or
fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, no assessment of additional
tax shall be made after the expiration of more than three years from the
date of the filing of a return; provided, however, that, where no return has
been filed as required by this chapter, the tax may be assessed at any time.
§ 48-7. Notices.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this chapter may
be given by mailing the same to the persons for whom it is intended, in a
postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address given by him
in the last return filed by him under this chapter or, if no return has been
filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to
whom addressed. Any period of time, which is determined according to the
provisions of this chapter by the giving of notice, shall commence to run
from the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 48-8. Penalties.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return or to pay any tax
or any portion thereof within the time required by this chapter shall be
subject to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due, plus 1% of such tax for
each month of delay or fraction thereof, excepting the first month after such
return was required to be filed or such tax became due; but the Treasurer,
for cause shown, may extend the time for filing any return and, if satisfied
that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any portion of the penalty
fixed by the foregoing provisions of this section.
§ 48-9. Refunds.
If within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty the payer thereof
shall make application for a refund thereof, and the Treasurer or the court
shall determine that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof was
erroneously or illegally collected, the Treasurer shall refund the amount so
determined. For like cause and within the same period, a refund may be so
made on the initiative of the Treasurer. However, no refund shall be made
of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination of the Treasurer as
hereinbefore provided, unless the Treasurer, after a hearing as hereinbefore
provided or of his own motion, shall have reduced the tax or penalty or it
§ 48-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 48-9
1:371
shall have been established in a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil
Practice Law and Rules of the State of New York that such determination
was erroneous or illegal. All refunds shall be made out of moneys collected
under this chapter. An application for a refund, made as hereinbefore
provided, shall be deemed an application for the revision of any tax or
penalty complained of, and the Treasurer may receive additional evidence
with respect thereto. After making his determination, the Treasurer shall
give notice thereof to the person interested, and he shall be entitled to an
order to review such determination under said Article 78, subject to the
provision hereinbefore contained relating to the granting of such an order.
§ 48-10. Tax not to be added to bills.
The tax imposed by this chapter shall be charged against and be paid by
the utility and shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by
the utility to customers or others but shall constitute a part of the operating
costs of such utility.
§ 48-11. Enforcement.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this
chapter, the Village Attorney shall, upon the request of the Treasurer, bring
an action to enforce payment of the same. The proceeds of any judgment
obtained in any such action shall be paid to the Treasurer. Each such tax
and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person liable to pay the
same, in the same manner and to the same extent that the tax and penalty
imposed by § 186-a of the Tax Law is made a lien.
§ 48-12. Powers of Village Treasurer.
In the administration of this chapter, the Treasurer shall have power to
make such reasonable rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law, as
may be necessary for the exercise of his powers and the performance of
his duties and to prescribe the form of blanks, reports and other records
relating to the administration and enforcement of the tax, to take testimony
and proofs, under oath, with reference to any matter within the line of his
official duty under this chapter and to subpoena and require the attendance
of witnesses and the production of books, papers and documents.
§ 48-13. Returns held confidential; exceptions; penalties for
offenses.
A. Except in accordance with proper judicial order or as otherwise
provided by law, it shall be unlawful for the Treasurer or any agent,
clerk or employee of the Village of Brockport to divulge or make known

which events, the court may require the production of and may admit
in evidence so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby
as are pertinent to the action or proceeding, and no more. Nothing
herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a person or his
duly authorized representative, of a copy of any return filed by him,
nor to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent
the identification of particular returns and the items thereof, or the
publication of delinquent lists showing the names of persons who have
failed to pay their taxes at the time and in the manner provided for
by this chapter, together with any relevant information which, in the
opinion of the Treasurer, may assist in the collection of such delinquent
taxes; or the inspection by the Village Attorney or other legal
representatives of the Village of Brockport of the return of any person
who shall bring action to set aside or review the tax based thereon
or against whom an action has been instituted in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.

punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or by imprisonment not
exceeding one year, or both, and if the offender be an officer, agent,
clerk or employee of the Village of Brockport, he shall be dismissed
from office and shall be incapable of holding any office or employment
in the Village of Brockport for a period of five years thereafter.
C. Notwithstanding any provisions of this chapter, the Treasurer may
exchange with the chief fiscal officer of any city or any other village in
the State of New York information contained in returns filed under this

tax purposes only; and the Treasurer shall, upon request, furnish the
State Tax Commission with any information contained in such returns.

§ 58-12 BROCKPORT CODE § 58-12
1:448
evidence supplied which would support the specific parking needs
of individual uses. In granting such a reduction, the Planning Board
shall reserve the authority to require additional spaces to meet
actual needs.
(12) The maximum parking ratio for each lot in a Limited Industrial Use
District shall be four parking spaces per 1,000 square feet of gross

markers, directional signs, entrance and exit signs, and other such
§ 58-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-12
1:449
signs which are erected on the premises, provided that such signs

lot.
(15) A landscaping plan shall be submitted with each site development
plan. The landscaping plan shall be designed to achieve the
following:
(a) The existing tree cover should be retained to the maximum
extent feasible. Particular emphasis shall be given to retaining
existing trees which are located along the perimeter of a
Limited Industrial Use District. The maintenance of existing
tree cover will serve to conceal proposed buildings and assist
in maintaining a human scale in Limited Industrial Use
Districts.
(b) Proposed landscaping should consist of an appropriate mix and
use of vegetation which is indigenous to this area of New York.
Nonindigenous landscape materials should be limited to use
for accent purposes only.
(c) Plant materials shall serve to provide continuity between lots.
(d) Where the lot lines of the subject lot coincide with that of
another lot in residential or business or commercial use or the
subject lot abuts or is traversed by a nonindustrial zoning
district boundary, there shall be planted or installed along the
lot lines thereof berms, trees, shrubs and/or fencing of such
type and spacing as shall be required by the Planning Board to
adequately screen all operations on the lot from the viewed
adjoining properties. Generally, such screening shall be a
minimum of eight feet in height and, if composed of plants,
shall not be less than four feet in height but capable of
reaching eight feet in height at maturity.
(e) New plantings should be selected and arranged to complement
existing site vegetation.
§ 58-12 BROCKPORT CODE § 58-12
1:450
§ 58-13. I Industrial Use Districts (I Districts).
The following regulations shall apply in the I Industrial Use Districts.
(16) All developed lots which contain unbuilt areas shall be landscaped
with a combination of trees, shrubs, perennials and turf grass.
(17) Landscaping along public or private streets in a Limited Industrial
Use District should have an organized formal planting scheme. A
formal planting scheme with trees lining the street in definite
sequence will define the edges of individual properties and the
boundaries of functional space. New trees shall be planted 50 feet
on center along designated streets. Plantings should be deciduous
shade trees approved by the Planning Board.
(18) Plantings for the space between buildings and parking areas and at
building entrances should be selected and arranged with the intent
of creating human scale outdoor space which recognizes the
pedestrian activity in the Limited Industrial Use Districts and the
need to identify building entrances. Although the Planning Board
shall approve the use of all plantings proposed, a wide range of
ground cover, shrubs and trees are encouraged in Limited
Industrial Use Districts to create interest and a degree of
landscape appropriate to the pedestrian use.
(19) All buildings with exposed foundations shall have foundation
plantings. The purpose of foundation plantings is to screen exposed
foundations and to provide a soft transition between the walls of a
building and the landscape.
(20) All unpaved surfaces not planted with trees, shrubs or ground
cover shall be turf grass.
(21) Lighting shall be placed in a logical manner and shall be
appropriate in style and intensity to provide illumination and
security for each lot. Lighting shall be provided in areas that would
be dangerous if unlit, such as ramps, intersections and abrupt
changes in grade. A lighting plan shall be developed in a manner
that contains and directs lighting into a Limited Industrial Use
District and away from adjacent areas.

§ 58-22. Off-street parking requirements. [Added 3-29-1965;
amended 11-19-1973, effective 1-1-1974]
prescribed by the Zoning Board of Appeals to conform as nearly as
practical to the requirements for the district in which the building,
structure or use is situated.
(2) A nonconforming use, if changed to a permitted use for the district
in which it is located, shall not thereafter be changed to a
nonconforming use, nor shall one nonconforming use be
substituted for another simply because it is generically similar to
an existing nonconforming use.

may be made to the Zoning Board of Appeals, which shall require
that degree of compliance as it may deem reasonable for that part
of the structure or use that is legally nonconforming, but shall not
waive any part of the requirement for that part of the structure or
use that constitutes an enlargement or extension thereof. However,
in no event shall consideration be given nor a decision be
determined on whether to issue a building permit, certificate of
occupancy or the granting of a variance by the Zoning Board of
Appeals by the fact that maximum economic benefit from the
premises may not be derived because of the requirements of this
section. [Amended 7-20-1987 by L.L. No. 5-1987]

into or out of any parking space provided in accordance with
this section.
(i) For residential use, such off-street parking shall not occupy any
part of any required front yard except that portion of the front
yard which may be construed as the logical extension of the
side yard, being in particular that area running perpendicular
from the extreme or side of a structure on the premises or
garage thereon to a street or alleyway. No more than 50% of
any side yard, or 25% of any rear yard other than the required
driveway, shall be permitted for a parking area. Such off-street
parking space may be included as part of a required open
space for side or rear yards.

[3] Buildings located on Main Street between the New York
State Canal and State Street and Erie Street and on
Market Street between Main Street and Water Street shall
provide parking as mandated by the Village Planning
Board and are exempt from the foregoing provisions of
