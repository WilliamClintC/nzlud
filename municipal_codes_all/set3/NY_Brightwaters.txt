DEFENSE AND INDEMNIFICATION
GENERAL REFERENCES
Officers and employees  See Ch. 19.
§ 8-1. Legislative intent.2
The purpose of this chapter is to provide legal and financial protection
for those individuals serving the Village of Brightwaters from losses which
may be brought against them in their individual capacity for actions taken
while in the performance of their official duties and responsibilities. In
enacting this chapter, the Village Board of Trustees finds that the State of
New York has enacted similar provisions for the legal and financial security
of its officers and employees and further finds that such security is also
required for local personnel. By enactment of this chapter, the Board of
Trustees does not intend to limit or otherwise abrogate any existing right or
responsibility of the Village or its employees with regard to indemnification
or legal defense. It is the intent of this chapter to provide similar coverage
for local employees as is presently provided for state employees so as to
continue to attract qualified individuals to local government service.
§ 8-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires, the following
terms shall have the meanings indicated:
EMPLOYEE  Any person holding a position by election, appointment
or employment in the service of the Village of Brightwaters, whether or
not compensated, or a volunteer expressly authorized to participate in
a municipally sponsored volunteer program, but shall not include an
independent contractor. The term "employee" shall include a former
employee, his estate or judicially appointed personal representative.
§ 8-3. Provisions for defense.
A. Upon compliance by the employee with the provisions of § 8-5 of this
chapter, the Village of Brightwaters shall provide for the defense of the
employee in any civil action or proceeding in any state or federal court
arising out of any alleged act or omission which occurred or is alleged
in the complaint to have occurred while the employee was acting within
the scope of his public employment or duties or which is brought to
enforce a provision of 42 U.S.C. § 1981 or 1983. This duty to provide for
a defense shall not arise where such civil action or proceeding is
brought by or on behalf of the Village of Brightwaters.
2. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code; see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I.
§ 1-13 BRIGHTWATERS CODE § 8-3

B. Subject to the conditions set forth in Subsection A of this section, the
employee shall be entitled to be represented by the Village Attorney;
provided, however, that the employee shall be entitled to
representation by private counsel of his choice in any civil judicial
proceeding whenever the Village Attorney determines, based upon his
investigation and review of the facts and circumstances of the case, the
representation by the Village Attorney would be inappropriate or
whenever a court of competent jurisdiction determines that a conflict of
interest exists and that the employee is entitled to be represented by
private counsel of his choice. The Village Attorney may require, as a
condition of payment of the fees and expenses, that the employee or
group of employees be represented by the same counsel. If the
employee or group of employees is entitled to representation by private
counsel under the provisions of this section, the Village Attorney shall
so certify to the Village Board. Reasonable attorneys' fees and litigation
expenses shall be paid by the Village to such private counsel from time
to time during the pendency of the civil action or proceeding, subject to
certification that the employee is entitled to representation under the
terms and conditions of this Subsection B by the head of the
department, commission, division, office or agency in which such
employee is employed and upon the audit and warrant of the Village
Treasurer. Any dispute with respect to representation of multiple
employees by a single counsel or the amount of litigation expenses or
the reasonableness of attorney's fees shall be resolved by the court
upon motion or by way of a special proceeding.
C. Where the employee delivers process and a request for a defense to the
Village Attorney as required by § 8-5 of this chapter, the Attorney shall
take the necessary steps, including the retention of private counsel
under the terms and conditions provided in Subsection B of this section,
on behalf of the employee to avoid entry of a default judgment pending
resolution of any question pertaining to the obligation to provide for a
defense.
A. The Village shall indemnify and save harmless its employees in the
amount of any judgment obtained against such employees in any state
or federal court or in the amount of any settlement of a claim, provided
that the act or omission from which such judgment or settlement arose
occurred while the employee was acting within the scope of his public
employment or duties. The duty to indemnify and save harmless
prescribed by this section shall not arise where the injury or damage
resulted from intentional wrongdoing or recklessness on the part of the
employee.
B. Any employee represented by private counsel shall cause to be
submitted to the Board of Trustees any proposed settlement which may
be subject to indemnification by the Village; and, if not inconsistent
with the provisions of this chapter, the Mayor shall certify such

shall be conditioned upon delivery to the Village Attorney or his assistant,
at his office, by the employee of the original or a copy of any summons,
complaint, process, notice, demand or pleading within 10 days after he is
served with such document and the full cooperation of the employee in
the defense of such action or proceeding and in defense of any action or
proceeding against the state based upon the same act or omission and in the
prosecution of any appeal. Such delivery shall be deemed a request by the
employee that the Village provide for his defense pursuant to this chapter.
§ 8-6. Limitation of applicability.
The benefits of this chapter shall inure only to employees, as defined herein,
and shall not enlarge or diminish the rights of any other party, nor shall any
provision of this chapter be construed to affect, alter or repeal any provision
of the Workers' Compensation Law.
§ 8-7. Effect on insurers.
The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to impair, alter, limit
or modify the rights and obligations of any insurer under any policy of
insurance.

pending on the effective date hereof or hereafter instituted.
settlement and submit such settlement and certification to the Village
Attorney. The Attorney shall give his approval if, in his judgment, the
settlement is in the best interest of the Village. Nothing in this section
shall be construed to authorize the Village to indemnify or save
harmless an employee with respect to a settlement not so reviewed and
approved by the Village Attorney.
C. Upon entry of a final judgment against the employee or upon the
settlement of the claim, the employee shall cause to be served a copy of
such judgment or settlement, personally or by certified or registered
mail, within 30 days of the date of entry of settlement, upon the Mayor;
and, if not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, such
judgment or settlement shall be certified for payment by such Mayor. If

shall be paid upon the audit and warrant of the Village Treasurer.

entity, officer or employee of the Village or any right to defense and/or
indemnification provided for any governmental officer or employee by, in
accordance with or by reason of any other provision of state or federal
statutory or common law.
§ 8-10. Payment of claims by Village.4
The Village shall be solely liable for and shall pay any amount which such
public officials become legally obligated to pay or which the Village shall
be required by law to pay for any claim or claims made against the public
officials for their public acts, which shall include damages, judgments,
settlements, costs and expenses of investigation and defense of legal
actions, claims or suits and appeals therefrom and costs of attachment,
appeal or similar bonds, including any insurance policy deductible and
including all sums in excess of any insurance policy limits, which are not

Carnivals, street fairs and circuses  See Ch.

§ 33-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Outdoor and Public Assembly Local Law
of the Village of Brightwaters."
§ 33-1.1. Purpose.
By adoption of this chapter, the Village Board seeks to regulate those
listed organized events which attract a large number of people, and might
adversely affect the well-being of Village residents. Organized activities
which are open to the public, either on private or public property, often
involve large assemblages of people, generally require some control over
traffic and parking and can cause a strain on governmental services. In
the case of events held on public property, the large number of people
which may be drawn to certain events has further potential to interfere
with the general public's normal use of roads and municipal facilities. This
chapter is intended to minimize the impact of these activities by appropriate
regulation.
§ 33-2. Permit required; application.
A. No person, organization, firm or company shall conduct any organized
race, swimming event, children's ride, adult ride, music performance or
fireworks display, whether on public or private property or Village
waters, without an outdoor assembly permit. Additionally, any event
involving the services of the Village of Brightwaters requires an outdoor
assembly permit from the Village Board of Trustees. Additionally, at a
Village-owned beach or park, the following activities shall only be
permitted under the terms and conditions of an outdoor assembly
permit duly issued by the Village Board:
(1) Activities involving the erection of a dance floor, tent greater than
100 feet, arch, fence or other structure; or
(2) Private concerts, shows or dances; or
(3) Staging area for walkathons, marathons, road races or bicycle
races.
§ 19-12 BRIGHTWATERS CODE § 33-2
16:22
§ 33-3. Issuance of permit.
A permit shall be issued only if the proposed activity is approved by the
Board of Trustees. In deciding whether or not to approve the issuance of
such permit, the Village Board shall consider:
B. Application.
(1) Written application must be made to the Village Board and filed
with the Village Clerk, together with the appropriate fee (to be
determined by the Board of Trustees) and a deposit (to be
determined by the Board of Trustees) to assure compliance with
the terms upon which each permit shall be deemed to have been
issued.
(2) Where the Village Board determines that there is no specific Village
benefit from the event, a deposit shall be made in an amount to be
determined prior to issuance of the permit based upon the
estimated direct costs attributable to additional code enforcement
and highway costs associated with the event. After the event, the
deposit shall be used to cover such costs, and any excess deposit
will be refunded.
(3) The applications must be filled at least 45 days in advance of the
earliest date for which the permit is applied for. Applications
seeking to be processed in less time than specified above shall pay
a rush fee in the amount of $100 in additional to the prescribed
application fee.
(4) The application must be signed by an adult who shall be
responsible for the statements therein and for the conditions for
which each permit is deemed issued. A permit issued shall be
revoked forthwith for any violation of the terms or conditions
herein set forth, which terms shall be as set forth in this chapter.
(5) The application shall clearly describe the premises to be used.
(6) The applicant shall provide a certificate of insurance evidencing
coverage in the amount of $1,000,000 per occurrence/$2,000,000
aggregate, or in another amount as specified by the Village Board,
and naming the Village of Brightwaters as additional insured
during the time of the event.

to attend the gathering.
B. The sufficiency or arrangements made to control traffic, parking, noise,
lighting and refuse.

latrines, of a number and type approved by rules of the Suffolk County
Department of Health, for the use of persons engaged in conducting the
undertaking for which the permits shall apply and for the patrons of said
permitted undertaking, during the permit period.
§ 33-5. Applicants to clean up site; return of deposit.
Upon the expiration or revocation of the permit, the permit holder shall
leave the site clean and free of all debris. For a failure to clean up the
premises or site, the same shall be done at the expense of the applicant. The
deposit, or as much as remains after the payment of cleanup and highway
costs, shall be returned to the permit holder.
§ 33-6. Trespassing on adjoining property.
The applicant shall be required to prevent patrons, permittees and/or
invitees of the undertaking for which the permit is issued or persons
engaged in conducting the same from trespassing upon the adjoining
property or premises and shall set forth in the application that details how
the same shall be accomplished.
§ 33-7. Penalties for offenses.

the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be
evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  The land in the floodplain
within a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. This area may be designated as Zone A, AE,
AH, AO, A1-A30, A99, V, VO, VE or V1-V30. It is also commonly referred
to as the "base floodplain" or "one-hundred-year floodplain."

§ 61-13. Application for permit.
The applicant shall provide at least the following information, where
applicable. Additional information may be required on the permit
application form.
A. Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for all
construction and other development to be undertaken in areas of
special flood hazard in this community for the purpose of protecting its
citizens from increased flood hazards and ensuring that new
development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its exposure to
flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any development in an area
of special flood hazard, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
enumerated in § 61-6, without a valid floodplain development permit.
Application for a permit shall be made on forms furnished by the local
administrator and may include but not be limited to plans, in duplicate,
drawn to scale and showing the nature, location, dimensions and
elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill,
storage of materials and drainage facilities; and the location of the
foregoing.
B. Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be
accompanied by an application fee of $50. In addition the applicant
shall be responsible for reimbursing the Village of Brightwaters for any
additional costs necessary for review, inspection and approval of this
project. The local administrator may require a deposit of no more than
$500 to cover these additional costs.
A. The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor
(including basement or cellar) of any new or substantially improved
structure to be located in Zones A1-A30, AE or AH, or Zone A if base
flood elevation data are available. Upon completion of the lowest floor,
the permittee shall submit to the local administrator the as-built
elevation, certified by a licensed professional engineer or surveyor.
B. The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the bottom of
the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and
columns) of any new or substantially improved structure to be located
in Zones V1-V30 or VE, or Zone V if base flood elevation data are
available. Upon completion of the lowest floor, the permittee shall
§ 61-11 FACILITIES, VILLAGE § 61-13
56:51
submit to the local administrator the as-built elevation, certified by a
licensed professional engineer or surveyor.
C. The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any new
or substantially improved nonresidential structure will be floodproofed.
Upon completion of the floodproofed portion of the structure, the
permittee shall submit to the local administrator the as-built
floodproofed elevation, certified by a professional engineer or surveyor.
D. A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that any
utility floodproofing will meet the criteria in § 61-16C, Utilities.
E. A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that any
nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the floodproofing
criteria in § 61-19, Nonresidential structures (except coastal highhazard

proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard,
all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
applicable standards of Article V, Construction standards, and, in
particular, subsection § 61-15B, Subdivision proposals.
(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special
flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property
(e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood velocities). The local
administrator may require the applicant to submit additional
technical analyses and data necessary to complete the
determination. If the proposed development may result in physical
damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
Article V, Construction standards, no permit shall be issued. The
applicant may revise the application to include measures that
mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit the
application.
(4) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
state or federal law.
B. Use of other flood data.

areas of special flood hazard on the community's Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced water surface elevation
data (these areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM) nor
identified a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review
§ 61-13 FACILITIES, VILLAGE § 61-14
56:53
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 61-13H, as criteria for requiring that new
construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meet the requirements of this chapter.
(2) When base flood elevation data are not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the purposes
of this chapter.
C. Alteration of watercourses. The local administrator shall:
(1) Notify adjacent communities and the New York State Department
of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting any alteration or
relocation of a watercourse and submit evidence of such
notification to the Regional Director, Region II, Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
(2) Determine that the permit holder has provided for maintenance
within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
D. Construction stage.
(1) In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor or
completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially improved
structure, the local administrator shall obtain from the permit
holder a certification of the as-built elevation of the lowest floor or
floodproofed elevation, in relation to mean sea level. The certificate
shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a licensed
land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by the same.
For manufactured homes, the permit holder shall submit the
certificate of elevation upon placement of the structure on the site.
A certificate of elevation must also be submitted for a recreational
vehicle if it remains on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer
(unless it is fully licensed and ready for highway use).
(2) In Zones V1-V30 and VE, and also Zone V if base flood elevation
data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor of a new or
substantially improved structure, the permit holder shall submit to
the local administrator a certificate of elevation, in relation to mean
sea level, of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the
lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns). For manufactured
homes, the permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation
upon placement of the structure on the site. An elevation certificate
must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it remains on a
site 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is fully licensed and
ready for highway use).
§ 61-14 BRIGHTWATERS CODE § 61-14
56:54
(3) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval of
the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies detected
shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project unless
immediately corrected.
E. Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's engineer or
architect shall make periodic inspections at appropriate times
throughout the period of construction in order to monitor compliance
with permit conditions and enable said inspector to certify, if requested,
that the development is in compliance with the requirements of the
floodplain development permit and/or any variance provisions.
F. Stop-work orders.
(1) The local administrator shall issue or cause to be issued a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found ongoing without a
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 61-9 of this chapter.
(2) The local administrator shall issue or cause to be issued a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found noncompliant
with the provisions of this chapter and/or the conditions of the
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 61-9 of this chapter.
G. Certificate of compliance.
(1) In areas of special flood hazard, as determined by documents
enumerated in § 61-6, it shall be unlawful to occupy or to permit the
use or occupancy of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate
of compliance has been issued by the local administrator stating
that the building or land conforms to the requirements of this
chapter.
(2) A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the local
administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in
areas of special flood hazard.
(3) Issuance of the certificate shall be based upon the inspections
conducted as prescribed in Subsection E, Inspections, and/or any
certified elevations, hydraulic data, floodproofing, anchoring
requirements or encroachment analyses which may have been
required as a condition of the approved permit.

A. Elevation. The following standards, in addition to the standards in
§§ 61-15B, Subdivision proposals; 61-15C, Encroachments; and 61-16,
Standards for all structures, apply to structures located in areas of
special flood hazard as indicated.
(1) Within Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, new construction and substantial
improvements shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated to or above the base flood level.
(2) Within Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available,
new and substantially improved structures shall have the lowest
floor (including basement) elevated at least three feet above the
highest adjacent grade.
(3) Within Zone AO, new and substantially improved structures shall
have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number
specified in feet on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map
enumerated in § 61-6 (at least two feet if no depth number is
specified).
(4) Within Zones AH and AO, adequate drainage paths are required to
guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures on
slopes.
A. Elevation. New construction and substantial improvements shall be
elevated on pilings, columns or shear walls such that the bottom of the
lowest horizontal structural member supporting the lowest elevated
floor (excluding columns, piles, diagonal bracing attached to the piles
or columns, grade beams, pile caps and other members designed to
§ 61-16 BRIGHTWATERS CODE § 61-18
56:60
either withstand storm action or break away without imparting
damaging loads to the structure) is elevated to or above the level of the
base flood so as not to impede the flow of water.
B. Determination of loading forces. Structural design shall consider the
effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously during the base
flood on all building components.
(1) The structural design shall be adequate to resist water forces that
would occur during the base flood. Horizontal water loads
considered shall include inertial and drag forces of waves, current
drag forces and impact forces from waterborne storm debris.
Dynamic uplift loads shall also be considered if bulkheads, walls or
other natural or man-made flow obstructions could cause wave
runup beyond the elevation of the base flood.
(2) Buildings shall be designed and constructed to resist the forces due
to wind pressure. Wind forces on the superstructure include
windward and leeward forces on vertical walls, uplift on the roof,
internal forces when openings allow wind to enter the house and
upward force on the underside of the house when it is exposed. In
the design, the wind should be assumed to blow potentially from
any lateral direction relative to the house.
(3) Wind loading values used shall be those required by the building
code.
C. Foundation standards.
(1) The pilings or column foundation and structure attached thereto
shall be adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral
movement due to the effects of wind and water pressures acting
simultaneously on all building components. Foundations must be
designed to transfer safely to the underlying soil all loads due to
wind, water, dead load, live load and other loads (including uplift
due to wind and water).
(2) Spread footings and fill material shall not be used for structural
support of a new building or substantial improvement of an existing
structure.
D. Pile foundation design.
(1) The design ratio of pile spacing to pile diameter shall not be less
than eight to one for individual piles (this shall not apply to pile
clusters located below the design grade) The maximum center-tocenter
spacing of wood piles shall not be more than 12 feet on
center under load bearing sills, beams or girders.
(2) Pilings shall have adequate soil penetration (bearing capacity) to
resist the combined wave and wind loads (lateral and uplift)
associated with the base flood acting simultaneously with typical
§ 61-18 FACILITIES, VILLAGE § 61-18
56:61
structure (live and dead) loads, and shall include consideration
of decreased resistance capacity caused by erosion of soil strata
surrounding the piles. The minimum penetration for foundation
piles is to an elevation of five feet below mean sea level (msl) datum
if the BFE is +10 msl or less, or to be at least 10 feet below msl if
the BFE is greater than +10 msl.
(3) Pile foundation analysis shall also include consideration of piles in
column action from the bottom of the structure to the stable soil
elevation of the site. Pilings may be horizontally or diagonally
braced to withstand wind and water forces.
(4) The minimum acceptable sizes for timber piles are a tip diameter of
eight inches for round timber piles and eight-by-eight inches for
square timber piles. All wood piles must be treated in accordance
with requirements of EPEE-C3 to minimize decay and damage from
fungus.
(5) Reinforced concrete piles shall be cast of concrete having a twentyeight-
day ultimate compressive strength of not less than 5,000
pounds per square inch, and shall be reinforced with a minimum of
four longitudinal steel bars having a combined area of not less than
1% nor more than 4% of the gross concrete area. Reinforcing for
precast piles shall have a concrete cover of not less than 1 1/4
inches for No. 5 bars and smaller and not less than 1 1/2 inches for
No. 6 through No. 11 bars. Reinforcement for piles cast in the field
shall have a concrete cover of not less than two inches.
(6) Piles shall be driven by means of a pile driver or drop hammer,
jetted or augered into place.
(7) Additional support for piles in the form of bracing may include
lateral or diagonal bracing between piles.
(8) When necessary, piles shall be braced at the ground line in both
directions by a wood timber grade beam or a reinforced concrete
grade beam. These at-grade supports should be securely attached
to the piles to provide support even if scoured from beneath.
(9) Diagonal bracing between piles, consisting of two-inch-by-eightinch
(minimum) members bolted to the piles, shall be limited in
location to below the lowest supporting structural member and
above the stable soil elevation, and aligned in the vertical plane
along pile rows perpendicular to the shoreline. Galvanized steel
rods (minimum diameter 1/2 inch) or cable type bracing is
permitted in any plane.
(10) Knee braces, which stiffen both the upper portion of a pile and the
beam-to-pile connection, may be used along pile rows
perpendicular and parallel to the shoreline. Knee braces shall be
two-by-four lumber bolted to the sides of the pile/beam, or four-byfour
or larger braces framed into the pile/beam. Bolting shall
§ 61-18 BRIGHTWATERS CODE § 61-18

breakaway wall components and certifies that the breakaway walls
will fail under water loads less than those that would occur during
the base flood and the elevated portion of the building and
supporting foundation system will not be subject to collapse,
displacement or other structural damage due to the effects of wind
and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components
(structural and nonstructural). Water loading values used shall be
those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values shall be
those required by the building code.

chapter.
C. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Appeals may appeal
such decision to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil
Practice Law and Rules.10
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, provided that Subsections D(1)
through (12) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
(1) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure.
(2) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D, E and F this section are met.
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.
D. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
10.Editors Note: Former Subsections D, E and F, which pertained to considerations by the
Board of Appeals, attachment of conditions to the granting of variances, and maintenance
of records by the local administrator, respectively, were repealed 3-6-2017 by L.L. No.
1-2017.
§ 61-22 FACILITIES, VILLAGE § 61-23
56:69
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
G. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written notice
over the signature of a community official that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
lowest floor elevation.

BAMBOO
GENERAL REFERENCES
Property maintenance  See Ch. 90.
§ 106-1. Purpose and intent.
§ 106-2. General provisions.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to promote and protect the
property, property values and welfare of the residents of the Village of
Brightwaters and their guests, and of the visitors to the Village, and to
protect the property and preserve the aesthetic qualities of the
environment of the Village of Brightwaters.
B. Intent. It is the finding of the Board of Trustees that the planting and/or
the growing of bamboo within the Village of Brightwaters has been and
will continue to be destructive to the natural environment, including
indigenous flora, and destructive to structures and walks on properties
within the Village adjoining and neighboring those properties where
bamboo has been planted and/or permitted to grow; that because of
these effects the planting and the growing of bamboo threatens the
value and physical integrity of both public and private property in the
Village; and that therefore, in order to protect and preserve said
environment and values, the Village declares it necessary to regulate or
prohibit the planting and/or growing of bamboo within the Village.
A. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
BAMBOO  Any tropical or semitropical grass of the genera Bambusa,
Dendrocalamus or of any other related genera.
BAMBOO PROPERTY OWNER  A property owner in the Village who
has planted or grown or caused the planting or growing of bamboo on
his property and/or permitted or permits the growing of bamboo on
his property that had initially encroached onto his property from an
adjoining or neighboring property.
B. Applicability. For purposes of this section, if bamboo is found growing
upon a property that shall constitute presumptive evidence that the
growing of bamboo on the property shall have occurred with the
consent of the owner of such property, except that such property owner
shall not be presumed to be a bamboo property owner if the property
owner did not plant or grow or cause said bamboo to be planted or
grown on his property and he shall provide the Building Inspector with
proof, satisfactory to the Building Inspector, that, within a reasonable
§ 105-14 BRIGHTWATERS CODE § 106-2
100:110
period of time after he first learned of the encroachment of bamboo
onto his property from an adjoining or neighboring property, he advised
the owner of such adjoining or neighboring property of his objection to
the encroachment of bamboo onto his property and/or initiated steps
for the removal of the bamboo from his property.
C. Prohibition. Effective upon the date this provision shall become law, the
planting or growing of bamboo shall be prohibited within the Village of
Brightwaters. Any person who thereafter plants or grows, or causes to
be planted or to grow, bamboo within the Village shall be deemed to be
in violation of this section and shall be subject to such penalties as are
set forth hereunder.
D. Regulation. Any bamboo which has been planted or otherwise
permitted to grow on any property within the Village of Brightwaters
prior to the effective date of this chapter may remain on such property
subject to compliance with this section. Each bamboo property owner
shall be responsible to ensure that the bamboo planted or growing on
his property prior to the effective date of this chapter does not encroach
or grow upon any adjoining or neighboring property or properties,
including all public property and rights-of-way held by the Village, and
shall be required to take such measures as are reasonably expected to
prevent such bamboo from invading or growing onto adjoining or
neighboring properties. Such measures shall include installation of
sheathing comprised of metal or other material impenetrable by
bamboo at a sufficient depth within the property line or lines where the
bamboo is planted or is growing to prevent the growth or encroachment
upon adjoining or neighboring property by said bamboo. The Board of
Trustees may from time to time prescribe such rules and regulations as
may be necessary to give effect to this.
E. Removal.
(1) In the event that bamboo growing on a bamboo property owner's
property invades or grows on an adjoining or neighboring property
that is owned or held on behalf of the Village of Brightwaters, the
Village shall notify the bamboo property owner that the bamboo
said owner had planted or caused to plant or had permitted to grow
on his property has invaded Village property and that the bamboo
property owner is responsible for the removal of such bamboo from
the Village property. This notice shall be sent by certified mail,
return receipt requested, and by regular mail to the latest address
of the bamboo property owner on file with the Village Clerk, and a
copy of the notice shall also be left in a conspicuous location on the
bamboo property owner's property in the Village of Brightwaters.
(2) In the event that the bamboo property owner does not remove or
contract for the removal of said bamboo from the Village property,
or does not make an arrangement with the Village for removal of
such bamboo within 30 days from the date the Village first
deposited the notice as provided in Subsection E(1) above with the

§ 106-3. Violations and penalties.

§ 113-7. Time of payment.
At the time of filing a return as required by this Article, each utility shall
pay to the Village Treasurer the tax imposed hereby for the period covered
by such return. Such tax shall be due and payable at the time of the filing of
the return or, if a return is not filed when due, on the last day on which the

§ 113-10. Failure to file or incorrect returns.
In case any return filed pursuant to this Article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the Village Treasurer, he may require at any time a further
or supplemental return, which shall contain any data that may be specified
by him, and if a corrected or sufficient return is not filed within 20 days
after the same is required by notice from him or if no return is made for
any period, the Village Treasurer shall determine the amount due from
such information as he is able to obtain and, if necessary, may estimate
the tax on the basis of external indices or otherwise. He shall give notice
A. Time of filing. Every utility subject to a tax hereunder shall file, on or
before March 1, a return for the 12 calendar months preceding each
return date, including any period for which the tax imposed hereby or
amendment hereof is effective. Any utility, whether subject to tax under

annual return.
B. Contents. Returns shall be filed with the Village Treasurer on a form to
be furnished by him for such purpose and shall show thereon the gross
income or gross operating income for the period covered by the return

a certification by the head of the utility making the same or of the owner
or of a copartner thereof or of a principal corporate officer to the effect
that the statements contained therein are true.
§ 113-6 BRIGHTWATERS CODE § 113-10
113:134
of such determination to the utility liable for such tax. Such determination
shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax unless the utility against which
it is assessed shall, within one year after the giving of notice of such
determination, apply to him for a hearing or unless the Village Treasurer,
of his own motion, shall reduce the same. After such hearing he shall give
notice of this decision to the utility liable for such tax.
§ 113-11. Review of final determination.
Any final determination of the amount of any tax payable hereunder shall
be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality, or any other reason
whatsoever, by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law
and Rules if the proceeding is commenced within 90 days after the giving
of notice of such final determination; provided, however, that any such
proceeding under said Article 78 shall not be instituted unless the amount
of any tax sought to be reviewed, with such interest and penalties thereon
as may be provided for by local law, ordinance or resolution, shall be first
deposited and an undertaking filed, in such amount and with such sureties
as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect that if such
proceeding is dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay all
costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.
§ 113-12. Notice.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this Article may
be given by mailing the same to the utility for which it is intended in a
postpaid envelope addressed to such utility at the address given by it in
the last return filed by it under this Article or, if no return has been filed,
then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the utility to
which addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the
provisions of this section by the giving of notice shall commence to run from
the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 113-13. Refunds.
If, within one year from the giving of notice of any determination or
assessment of any tax or penalty, the person liable for the tax shall make
application for a refund thereof and the Village Treasurer or the court shall
determine that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof was erroneously
or illegally collected, the Village Treasurer shall refund the amount so
determined. For like cause and within the same period, a refund may be
so made on the initiative of the Village Treasurer. However, no refund
shall be made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination of the
Village Treasurer as hereinbefore provided unless the Village Treasurer,
after a hearing as hereinbefore provided or of his own motion, shall have
reduced the tax or penalty or it shall have been established in a proceeding
in the manner provided in the Civil Practice Law and Rules that such
determination was erroneous or illegal. An application for a refund, made
as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an application for the revision
§ 113-10 TAXATION § 113-13
113:135
of any tax or penalty complained of, and the Village Treasurer may receive
additional evidence with respect thereto. After making his determination,
the Village Treasurer shall give notice thereof to the person interested, and
he shall be entitled to commence a proceeding to review such determination
in accordance with the provisions of the following section hereof.
§ 113-14. Review of proceedings for refund.
Where any tax imposed hereunder shall have been erroneously, illegally
or unconstitutionally collected and application for the refund thereof duly
made to the Village Treasurer and he shall have made a determination
denying such refund, such determination shall be reviewable by a
proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules; provided,
however, that such proceeding is instituted within 90 days after the giving
of the notice of such denial, that a final determination of tax due was not
previously made and that an undertaking is filed with the Village Treasurer,
in such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme Court
shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding is dismissed or the tax
confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in
the prosecution of such proceeding.
§ 113-15. Limitation of additional tax.
Except in the case of a willfully false or fraudulent return with the intent to
evade the tax, no assessment or additional tax shall be made with respect
to taxes imposed under this Article after the expiration of more than three
years from the date of filing of a return, provided, however, that where no
return has been filed as required hereby, the tax may be assessed at any
time.
§ 113-16. Powers of Village Treasurer.
In addition to any other powers herein given the Village Treasurer and in
order to further ensure payment of the tax imposed hereby, he shall have
the power to:
§ 113-17. Enforcement.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this
Article, the Village Attorney shall, upon the request of the Village Treasurer,
bring an action to enforce payment of the same. The proceeds of any
judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to the Village Treasurer.
A. Prescribe the form of all reports and returns required to be made
hereunder.
B. Take testimony and proofs, under oath, with reference to any matter
hereby entrusted to him.
C. Subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production
of books, papers, records and documents.
§ 113-13 BRIGHTWATERS CODE § 113-17
113:136
Each such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person
liable to pay the same in the same manner and to the same extent that the
tax and penalty imposed by § 186 of the Tax Law is made a lien.

the meanings indicated:
REAR YARD AREA  That area behind the line created by the line
between the two rear outermost points of the main dwelling at
a straight line and concurrent with the rear of said dwelling and
continuing to points on either which intersects the side property
lines of the dwelling.
(2) All livable extensions that project into the rear yard but are not the
outermost corners of said dwelling are to be deducted from the
total rear yard area.
(3) If said dwelling is a corner lot, then the legal address is the front
yard. The rear of that front address would be used to calculate the
rear yard area as noted above. The area in the rear yard behind the
parallel line running concurrent with the home along the second
front yard (not on the side where address is stated) and which runs
parallel with the side street will not be calculated as part of the
rear yard area.
D. Rear yard area limited for nonvegetative use. The ground area ratio
(GAR) available for use of nonvegetative or impervious surfaces is to be
no more than 30% of the rear yard area for plots over 15,000 square
feet. Where the property size is less than 15,000 square feet, GAR
allowable usage will be calculated at not more than 35% of the total
rear yard. "Nonimpervious surfaces" includes items such as patios,
decks, pavers, open-jointed flagstone, walkways and the like and also
includes, but is not limited to, sheds, rear garages, and other
outbuildings. Walkways greater than 42 inches, fixed generator and
fixed air-conditioning pads are not included in the GAR computation. All
impervious surfaces forward of the rear yard house lines shall be part of
the floor area ratio (FAR) under Village of Brightwaters Code § 128-29.
Pools, garages, sheds, and patios will continue to be calculated as part
of the Village's FAR. [Added 3-3-2014 by L.L. No. 3-2014; amended

The Village Board of Trustees finds that the unrestricted outside storage
and parking of vehicles, trailers and boats on public and private property
has an adverse impact on the visual character of the Village and diminishes
the available open space required in the front, rear and side yards. In order
to protect the residents from the adverse impact of such vehicles, the Board

boats shall be regulated as follows.

chapter. [Amended 8-1-2005 by L.L. No. 8-2005]
B. After a duly scheduled public hearing, the Village Board of Trustees
may issue a permit. Such hearing may be waived by the Village Board of
Trustees if it determines upon the application that the size of the

A. The definition of a "driveway" is that which is used or can be used for
parking vehicles. Its surface is impervious, including but not limited to
asphalt, gravel, stone or other nonvegetative material. It shall lead
perpendicular from a public road directly to a garage. If the property
does not have a garage, the driveway is that which has been established
for the use as the parking area of said dwelling. An allowable driveway
surface shall not exceed 35% of the total front yard area.
B. The front yard area is calculated from the two outermost front corners
of the dwelling (Diagram D-1, the area between lines A-1 on either side
of the property62) and that are perpendicular to the front property line
that borders the right-of-way ("ROW"). ROWs are not included in the
calculation. All proposed plans must be reviewed by the Village
Engineer and Highway Department for feasibility, approval and bond
amounts.
C. Primary driveways shall not exceed 22 feet in width and must have a
minimum side yard setback of four feet to impervious surface consisting
of vegetative matter. If both a primary driveway and a circular driveway
are established, a minimum setback from the impervious surface to the
property lines must be a minimum of four feet and 14 feet of vegetative
area, respectively.
D. Circular driveways shall not be less than 12 feet nor greater than 22
feet of drivable surface.
E. No property shall be allowed to have more than two means of egress to
public roads. Curb cuts at the property line may not be less than 12 feet
and not exceed 22 feet. Driveways at the intersection of the edge of
pavement may not be greater than 27 feet on said public road. Said
driveway may not flare out to more than 2.5 feet on either side between
the property line and edge of pavement known as the ROW. A corner lot

cut on a corner lot must be a minimum of 25 feet from the corner of the
property line. A primary and/or secondary driveway without a garage
cannot have impervious surface beyond the front or side corners of the
house.
F. In the case where a garage may not exist or if the garage is set back
beyond the outermost corners of the front of the main dwelling, then
the area between the two points of the main dwelling to that of either
where the driveway ends or the two outermost points of the front of the

Stormwater Management and Erosion and Sediment Control
[Added 12-3-2007 by L.L. No. 11-2007]
§ 128-101. Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
§ 128-102. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management
requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health,
safety, and welfare of the public residing within the Village and to address
A. Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious
cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and
increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition;
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of
waterborne pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and
other desirable species;
C. Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion
and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat;
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby
increasing streambank erosion and sedimentation;
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow;
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on
the waters of the Village;
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from land development activities;
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the
public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety;
I. Regulation of land development activities by means of performance
standards governing stormwater management and site design will
produce development compatible with the natural functions of a
particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse
effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.
§ 128-101 TAXATION § 128-102
113:263
the findings of fact set forth in § 128-101 of this article. This article seeks to
meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives:
§ 128-103. Applicability.
§ 128-104. Exemptions.
The following activities may be exempt from review under this article:
A. Meet the requirements of minimum measures 4 and 5 of the SPDES

amended or revised;
B. Require land development activities to conform to the substantive
requirements of the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation
State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) General Permit
for Construction Activities GP-02-01, or as amended or revised;
C. Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development
activities in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream
temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of
stream channels;
D. Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land
development activities which would otherwise degrade local water
quality;
E. Minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows
from any specific site during and following development to the
maximum extent practicable; and
F. Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint
source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management
practices and to ensure that these management practices are properly
maintained and eliminate threats to public safety.
A. This article shall be applicable to all land development activities as
defined in this article.
B. The Village shall designate a Stormwater Management Officer who
shall accept and review all stormwater pollution prevention plans and
may accept the certification of a licensed professional that the plans
conform to the requirements of this article.
C. All land development activities subject to review and/or approval by any
Board of the Village shall be reviewed subject to the standards
contained in this article.

D. Maintenance agreements. The Village shall approve a formal
maintenance agreement for stormwater management facilities binding
on all subsequent landowners and recorded in the office of the County
Clerk of the County of Suffolk as a deed restriction on the property prior
to final plan approval. The maintenance agreement shall be consistent
with the terms and conditions of Schedule B of this article, entitled
"Sample Stormwater Control Facility Maintenance Agreement."70 The
Village, in lieu of a maintenance agreement, at its sole discretion, may
accept dedication of any existing or future stormwater management
facility, provided such facility meets all the requirements of this article
and includes adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by
easement or otherwise, for inspection and regular maintenance.
A. Purpose/intent. The purpose of this section is to provide for the health,
safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the Village of Brightwaters
through the regulation of nonstormwater discharges to the municipal
separate storm sewer system (MS4) to the maximum extent practicable
as required by federal and state law. This section establishes methods
for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the MS4 in order to
comply with requirements of the SPDES general permit for municipal
separate storm sewer system. The objectives of this section are:
(1) To meet the requirements of the SPDES general permit for
stormwater discharges from MS4s, Permit No. GP-02-02 or as
amended or revised;
(2) To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the MS4 since such
systems are not designed to accept, process, or discharge
nonstormwater wastes;
(3) To prohibit illicit connections, activities and discharges to the MS4;
(4) To establish legal authority to carry out all inspections, surveillance
and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with
this section; and
(5) To promote public awareness of the hazards involved in the
improper discharge of trash, yard waste, lawn chemicals, pet
waste, wastewater, grease, oil, petroleum products, cleaning
products, paint products, hazardous waste, sediment and other
pollutants into the MS4.

that cause or contribute to violations of the municipality's MS4
SPDES permit authorization, that person shall take all reasonable
actions to correct such activities such that he or she no longer
causes or contributes to violations of the municipality's MS4
SPDES permit authorization.
I. Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce stormwater pollutants by
use of best management practices.
(1) Best management practices. Where the SMO has identified illicit
discharges as defined in Subsection B or activities contaminating
stormwater as defined in Subsection H, the municipality may
require implementation of best management practices (BMPs) to
control those illicit discharges and activities.
(a) The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial
establishment shall provide, at its own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or
other waste into the MS4 through the use of structural or
nonstructural BMPs.
(b) Any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or
may be, the source of an illicit discharge as defined in
Subsection B may be required to implement, at said person's
expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to
reduce or eliminate the source of pollutant(s) to the MS4.
(c) Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid SPDES
permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated
with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be
deemed compliance with the provisions of this section.
J. Suspension of access to MS4; illicit discharges in emergency situations.
(1) The SMO may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access
to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
§ 128-108.1 TAXATION § 128-108.1
113:279
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, to the health or welfare of
persons, or to the MS4. The SMO shall notify the person of such
suspension within a reasonable time thereafter in writing of the
reasons for the suspension. If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the SMO may take such
steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the
MS4 or to minimize danger to persons.
(2) Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any persons
discharging to the municipality's MS4 in violation of this section
may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would
abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The SMO will notify a violator
in writing of the proposed termination of its MS4 access and the
reasons therefor. The violator may petition the SMO for a
reconsideration and hearing. Access may be granted by the SMO if
he/she finds that the illicit discharge has ceased and the discharger
has taken steps to prevent its recurrence. Access may be denied if
the SMO determines in writing that the illicit discharge has not
ceased or is likely to recur. A person commits an offense if the
person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to
this subsection, without the prior approval of the SMO.
K. Industrial or construction activity discharges. Any person subject to an
industrial or construction activity SPDES stormwater discharge permit
shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance
with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the
municipality prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
L. Access and monitoring of discharges.
(1) Applicability. This subsection applies to all facilities that the SMO
must inspect to enforce any provision of this section or whenever
the authorized enforcement agency has cause to believe that there
exists, or potentially exists, in or upon any premises, any condition
which constitutes a violation of this section.
(2) Access to facilities.
(a) The SMO shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities
subject to this regulation under this section as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this section. If a
discharger has security measures in force which require
proper identification and clearance before entry into its
premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to the SMO.
(b) Facility operators shall allow the SMO ready access to all parts
of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and the copying of records as may be required to
implement this section.
§ 128-108.1 BRIGHTWATERS CODE § 128-108.1
113:280
(c) The municipality shall have the right to set up on any facility
subject to this section such devices as are necessary in the
opinion of the SMO to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of
the facility's stormwater discharge.
(d) The municipality has the right to require the facilities subject
to this section to install monitoring equipment as is reasonably
necessary to determine compliance with this section. The
facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices
used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be
calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(e) Unreasonable delay in allowing the municipality access to a
facility subject to this section is a violation of this section. A
person who is the operator of a facility subject to this section
commits an offense if the person denies the municipality
reasonable access to the facility for the purpose of conducting
any activity authorized or required by this section.
(f) If the SMO has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this section or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this section or any order
issued hereunder, then the SMO may seek issuance of a search
warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
M. Notification of spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as
soon as any person responsible for emergency response for a facility or
operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or
pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of
such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said
person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the
occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of
nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the municipality in
person or by telephone or by facsimile no later than the next business
day. Notifications in person or by telephone shall be confirmed by
written notice addressed and mailed to the municipality within three
business days of the telephone notice. If the discharge of prohibited
materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the
owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site
written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
N. Enforcement.

herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this
section shall be guilty of a violation punishable by the fines and
imprisonments contained in § 128-86 of this chapter. However, for
the purposes of conferring jurisdiction upon courts and judicial
officers generally, violations of this section shall be deemed
misdemeanors, and for such purpose only, all provisions of law
relating to misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each
week's continued violation shall constitute a separate additional
violation.
O. Appeal of notice of violation. Any person receiving a notice of violation
may appeal the determination of the SMO to the Village of Brightwaters
Board of Trustees within 15 days of its issuance, which Board shall hear
the appeal within 30 days after the filing of the appeal and, within five
days of making its decision, file its decision in the office of the Village
Clerk and mail a copy of its decision by certified mail to the discharger.
P. Corrective measures after appeal.

upholding the decision of the SMO, then the SMO shall request
the owner's permission for access to the subject private property
to take any and all measures reasonably necessary to abate the
violation and/or restore the property.
(2) If refused access to the subject private property, the SMO may seek
a warrant in a court of competent jurisdiction to be authorized to
enter upon the property to determine whether a violation has
occurred. Upon determination that a violation has occurred, the
SMO may seek a court order to take any and all measures
reasonably necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the
property. The cost of implementing and maintaining such measures
shall be the sole responsibility of the discharger.
Q. Injunctive relief. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any
provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this section.
If a person has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this
section, the SMO may petition for a preliminary or permanent
injunction restraining the person from activities which would create
further violations or compelling the person to perform abatement or
remediation of the violation.
R. Alternative remedies.
(1) Where a person has violated a provision of this section, he/she may
be eligible for alternative remedies in lieu of a civil penalty, upon

condition of drainage control facilities and other stormwater
management practices.
(4) Submission of reports. The Village's Stormwater Management
Officer may require monitoring and reporting from entities subject
to this article as are necessary to determine compliance with this
article.
(5) Right of entry for inspection. When any new stormwater
management facility is installed on private property or when any
new connection is made between private property and the public
stormwater system, the landowner shall grant to the Village of
Brightwaters the right to enter the property at reasonable times
and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection as
specified in Subsection A(3).
B. Performance guarantee.
(1) Construction completion guarantee. In order to ensure the full and
faithful completion of all land development activities related to
compliance with all conditions set forth by the Village of
Brightwaters in its approval of the stormwater pollution prevention
plan, the Village may require the applicant or developer to provide,
prior to construction, a performance bond, cash escrow, or
irrevocable letter of credit from an appropriate financial or surety
institution which guarantees satisfactory completion of the project
and names the Village of Brightwaters as the beneficiary. The
security shall be in an amount to be determined by the Village
based on submission of final design plans, with reference to actual
§ 128-109 TAXATION § 128-109
113:285
construction and landscaping costs. The performance guarantee
shall remain in force until the surety is released from liability by
the Village of Brightwaters, provided that such period shall not be
less than one year from the date of final acceptance or such other
certification that the facilities have been constructed in accordance
with the approved plans and specifications and that a one-year
inspection has been conducted and the facilities have been found
to be acceptable to the Village of Brightwaters. Per-annum interest
on cash escrow deposits shall be reinvested in the account until the
surety is released from liability.
(2) Maintenance guarantee. Where stormwater management and
erosion and sediment control facilities are to be operated and
maintained by the developer or by a corporation that owns or
manages a commercial or industrial facility, the developer, prior to
construction, may be required to provide the Village of
Brightwaters with an irrevocable letter of credit from an approved
financial institution or surety to ensure proper operation and
maintenance of all stormwater management and erosion control
facilities both during and after construction, and until the facilities
are removed from operation. If the developer or landowner fails to
properly operate and maintain stormwater management and
erosion and sediment control facilities, the Village of Brightwaters
may draw upon the account to cover the costs of proper operation
and maintenance, including engineering and inspection costs.
(3) Recordkeeping. The Village of Brightwaters may require entities
subject to this article to maintain records demonstrating
compliance with this article.
C. Enforcement and penalties.
(1) Notice of violation. When the Village of Brightwaters determines
that a land development activity is not being carried out in
accordance with the requirements of this article, it may issue a
written notice of violation to the landowner, developer or applicant.
The notice of violation shall contain:
(a) The name and address of the landowner, developer or
applicant.
(b) The address, when available, or a description of the building,
structure or land upon which the violation is occurring.
(c) A statement specifying the nature of the violation.
(d) A description of the remedial measures necessary to bring the
land development activity into compliance with this article and
a time schedule for the completion of such remedial action.
§ 128-109 BRIGHTWATERS CODE § 128-109
113:286
(e) A statement of the penalty or penalties that shall or may be
assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is
directed.
(f) A statement that the determination of violation may be
appealed to the municipality by filing a written notice of appeal
within 15 days of service of notice of violation.
(2) Stop-work orders. The Village of Brightwaters may issue a stopwork
order for violations of this article. Persons receiving a stopwork
order shall be required to halt all land development activities,
except those activities that address the violation leading to the
stop-work order. The stop-work order shall be in effect until the
Village of Brightwaters confirms that the land development activity
is in compliance and the violation has been satisfactorily
addressed. Failure to address a stop-work order in a timely manner
may result in civil, criminal or monetary penalties in accordance
with the enforcement measures authorized in this article.
(3) Violations. Any land development activity that is commenced or is
conducted contrary to this article, may be restrained by injunction
or otherwise abated in a manner provided by law.
(4) Penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided
herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this
article shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a fine not
exceeding $350 or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six
months, or both, upon conviction for a first offense; upon conviction
for a second offense, both of which were committed within a period
of five years, punishable by a fine not less than $350 nor more than
$700 or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or
both; and upon conviction for a third or subsequent offense, all of
which were committed within a period of five years, punishable by
a fine not less than $700 nor more than $1,000 or imprisonment for
a period not to exceed six months, or both. However, for the
purposes of conferring jurisdiction upon courts and judicial officers
generally, violations of this article shall be deemed misdemeanors,
and for such purpose only all provisions of law relating to
misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each week's
continued violation shall constitute a separate additional violation.
(5) Withholding of certificate of occupancy. If any building or land
development activity is installed or conducted in violation of this
article the Stormwater Management Officer may prevent the
occupancy of said building or land.
(6) Restoration of lands. Any violator may be required to restore land
to its undisturbed condition. In the event that restoration is not
undertaken within a reasonable time after notice, the Village of
Brightwaters may take necessary corrective action, the cost of
which shall become a lien upon the property until paid.
§ 128-109 TAXATION § 128-109
113:287
§ 128-110. Severability; when effective.
If any provision of this article shall be judged invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such order or judgment shall not affect or invalidate the
remainder of this article, and this article shall take effect upon filing with
Office of the Secretary of State.
D. Fees for services. The Village of Brightwaters may require any person
undertaking land development activities regulated by this article to pay
reasonable costs at prevailing rates for review of SWPPPs, inspections,
or SMP maintenance performed by the Village of Brightwaters or
performed by a third party for the Village of Brightwaters.

ARTICLE XV
Exterior Lighting Standards
[Added 2-6-2012 by L.L. No. 2-2012]
§ 128-111. Standards for lighting in business districts.72
A. Every new or replaced lighting fixture on any parcel in any business
district or on any parcel owned by the Village of Brightwaters, whether
attached to a structure, freestanding, or affixed to a utility pole, shall be
directed downward with a zero-degree horizontal cutoff to the
illumination. No reflectors shall be mounted within 20 feet of the fixture
to redirect the light emanating from the fixture. Replacement of a bulb
within an existing fixture is not a replacement of a fixture and thus not
governed by the above standards.
B. The above standards do not apply to:
(1) Illumination of any United States flag pursuant to the U.S. Flag
Code (4 U.S.C.) or pursuant to any U.S. presidential order;
(2) Temporarily installed decorative lighting no greater than 1,000
cumulative wattage per parcel between November 15 of any year
and January 7 of its immediately succeeding year; and
(3) Internal lighting of translucent signs for which a Village permit is in
effect, but external lighting of opaque signs is not exempt and must
comply.
