The Village Board of Trustees of the Incorporated Village of Malverne, as
authorized by Article 11-AAA of the New York State General Municipal Law,
directs that there shall be a public referendum of eligible voters of the
Incorporated Village of Malverne on March 15, 2005, to determine whether
such service award program shall be established effective January 1, 2005.
§ 7-2. Type of plan.
The type of program shall be a "defined benefit plan" as described in Article
11-AAA.
§ 7-3. Death and disability benefits.
Under the proposed service award program, Malverne Volunteer
Ambulance Corps, Inc. active members shall have the opportunity to earn
pension-like and pre- "entitlement age" death and disability benefits. The
pension-like benefit shall be a lifetime monthly payment "service award,"
with payments beginning upon attainment of age 65, the "entitlement age."
The monthly benefit payment service award shall be equal to $15 ($180 per
annum) for each year of service award program service credit earned. When
an eligible participating volunteer ambulance worker dies before monthly
service award payments have effectively commenced, a death benefit shall
be payable to the volunteer ambulance worker's designated beneficiary (or
estate if no beneficiary is designated). The death benefit shall be actuarially
equivalent to the volunteer ambulance worker's earned service award and
shall be based on his or her earned service credit at the time of death.
When a volunteer ambulance worker shall become totally and permanently
disabled before service award payments effectively commence, a disability
benefit shall be payable. The disability benefit shall be actuarially
equivalent to the volunteer ambulance worker's earned service award based
on his or her earned service credit at the time of application for payment of
the disability benefit.
§ 7-4. Accrual of points.
A year of service award program service credit shall be earned by an active
member of the Malverne Volunteer Ambulance Corps, Inc. for each calendar
year after 2004 during which a participating volunteer ambulance worker

Article 11-AAA of the New York State General Municipal Law.
§ 7-5. Eligibility.
Up to five years of service credit may be earned under the point system by
a participating volunteer ambulance worker for service prior to 2005 and
after 1999. To be eligible to earn credit for such service, a volunteer must
become a program participant in accordance with the applicable provisions
of Article 11-AAA.
§ 7-6. Continuation of service after age 65.
Should a participant continue to be an active member of the Malverne
Volunteer Ambulance Corps, Inc. after attaining age 65 and having begun
to be paid monthly service award payments, he or she shall continue to
have the opportunity to earn service credit under the point system. The
additional monthly payments service award earned during a calendar year
after the calendar year of attainment of the entitlement age shall commence
to be paid as of January in the next succeeding calendar year.
§ 7-7. Sponsor and administrator.
In accordance with Article 11-AAA of the General Municipal Law, the
Incorporated Village of Malverne shall be the "sponsor" and the New York
State Comptroller, or his designee(s), shall be the administrator(s) of the
Incorporated Village of Malverne Volunteer Ambulance Worker Service
Award Program.
§ 7-8. Estimated annual cost.
The total 2005 annual cost, payable in 2006, of funding the Incorporated
Village of Malverne's Volunteer Ambulance Workers Service Award Program
benefits is estimated to be about $35,000 or about 1,500 per ambulance
worker, including the cost of administration. The estimated annual cost to
administer the program payable by the Incorporated Village of Malverne
is about $2,500. The total annual cost for current ambulance workers is
expected to decrease by about $14,000 after five years, when the cost of
service awards earned for volunteer ambulance service before 2005 shall
be fully paid.
§ 7-9. Annual payments.
The cost of service awards earned for volunteer ambulance service before
2005 shall be scheduled to be paid by the Incorporated Village of Malverne
in five consecutive annual payments of $14,000, or the equivalent thereof,
with the first payment to be made during calendar year 2006.

buildings, and extending, so far as practicable, from building line to curb.
On streets 50 feet or less in width and on streets having sidewalks less
than 15 feet in width, such sheds may extend beyond the curb to such
extent as may, on the recommendation of the Superintendent of Buildings,
be approved by the Village Board of Trustees, provided that when such
sheds extend to within 15 feet of the opposite building line, the written
approval of the lessees, tenants or occupants of the two stories or parts of
stories next above the curb of the buildings along the opposite building line
shall have been obtained before such approval is issued. Such shed shall
remain in place until the building is enclosed or, in case of demolition, until
the building has been reduced to 20 feet in height. Every such shed shall be
kept properly lighted at night.
§ 265-39. Temporary fences.
In any building operation that does not require a sidewalk shed as provided
in § 265-38 of this article, the owner or person doing or causing such work
to be done shall, unless relieved by a general rule of the Superintendent
of Buildings or a special permit from him, erect and maintain in front of
the building during such building operation a substantial fence, not less
§ 265-37 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 265-39
1:133
than eight feet high, of wood or other suitable material. Such fence may
extend not more than six feet into the highway and shall be built solid for its
full length, except for such openings, provided with sliding doors or doors
swinging inwards, as may be necessary for a proper prosecution of the
work.
§ 265-40. Roofs and skylights of adjoining buildings.
When any building is to be carried above the roof of an adjoining building,
proper means for the protection of the skylights and roof of such adjoining
building shall be provided by the person constructing or causing the
construction of such building, at his own expense, provided that if the
owner, lessee or tenant of the adjoining building should refuse permission
to have the roof and skylights so protected, the responsibility and expense
for the necessary protection shall devolve on the person refusing this
permission.
§ 265-41. Scaffolding.
All scaffolds used in connection with the erection, alteration or demolition
of any building shall be constructed in a manner to secure the safety of the
workers on them and of all persons passing under or near them. All scaffolds
used on or about buildings at a height of more than 20 feet above the street
or ground level, or a floor, except scaffolding wholly within the interior of
a building and covering the entire floor space of any room therein, shall
be provided along the outer edges and ends with substantial railings or
enclosures of wire mesh or other suitable material extending at least three
feet six inches above the working platform.
§ 265-42. Floors to be filled in or covered over.
If the floors of any building are to be of fireproof construction, the floor
filling shall be completed as the building progresses. If the floors consist of
wood beam, the under-flooring, when double flooring is to be used, shall be
laid on each story as the building progresses; when double floors are not
to be used, the floors two stories below the story where the work is being
performed shall be kept planked over. If the floor beams are of iron or steel,
the entire tier of iron or steel beams on which the structural iron or steel
work is being erected, except such spaces as may be reasonably required
for the proper construction of such iron or steel work and for the raising
or lowering of materials to be used in the construction of such building or
such spaces as may be designated by the approved plans for stairways and
shafts, shall be thoroughly planked over.
§ 265-43. Protection of floor openings.
All floor openings within a building in the course of construction shall be
enclosed or fenced in on all sides by a barrier of suitable height, except on
those sides which may be used for the handling of materials hoisted through
such openings or at which stairs or ladders land, provided that such sides,
§ 265-39 MALVERNE CODE § 265-43
1:134
other than landings, shall be guarded by an adjustable barrier not less than
three feet nor more than four feet from the floor and not less than two feet
from the edge of such opening.
§ 265-44. Weather protection.

ARTICLE IV
Excavations and Foundations
§ 265-48. Excavations.
A. Safeguarding generally. Until provisions for permanent support have
been made, all excavations shall be properly guarded and protected by
the person causing the excavation to be made so as to prevent the same
from becoming dangerous to life or limb and shall be sheet-piled,
braced or shored, where necessary, to prevent the adjoining earth from
caving in.
B. Support of neighboring walls.
(1) When the excavation exceeds 10 feet. Whenever an excavation is
intended to be, or shall be, carried to the depth of more than 10 feet
below the curb, the person causing such excavation to be made
shall at all times, if afforded the necessary license to enter upon the
adjoining land, and not otherwise, at his own expense, preserve and
protect from injury any wall, building or structure, the safety of
which may be affected by said excavation, and support the same by
proper foundations, whether said wall, building or structure is
down more or less than 10 feet below the curb. If the necessary
license is not accorded to the person making such excavation, then
it shall be the duty of the owner refusing to grant such license to
make such wall, building or structure safe and to support the same
by proper foundations; and, when necessary for that purpose, such
owner shall be permitted to enter upon the premises where such
excavation is to be made.
(2) When the excavation does not exceed 10 feet. If such excavation is
not intended to be, or shall not be, carried to a depth of more than
10 feet below the curb, the owner of any wall, building or structure,
the safety of which may be affected by said excavation, shall
preserve and protect the same from injury and support the same by
proper foundations and, when necessary for that purpose, shall be
permitted to enter upon the premises where such excavation is to
be made. In case such wall, building or structure, however, is so
located that the curb to which it is properly referred is at a higher
level than the curb to which the excavation is referred, such part of
any necessary underpinning or foundation as may be due to the
difference in curb levels shall be made and maintained at the joint
expense of the person causing the excavation to be made and the
owner of such wall, building or structure.
C. Support of party wall. In case an adjoining party wall is intended to be
used by the person causing the excavation to be made and such party
wall is in good condition and sufficient for the uses of the existing and
proposed buildings, the person causing the excavation to be made shall,
at his own expense, preserve such party wall from injury and support
§ 265-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 265-48
1:137
the same by proper foundations, so that said party wall shall be and
remain practically as safe as before the excavation was commenced.
D. Superintendent of Buildings may act. If the person whose duty it shall
be under the provisions of this chapter to properly guard and protect an
excavation, or to prevent adjoining earth from caving in or to preserve
or protect any wall, building or structure from injury, shall neglect or
fail to do so after having had a notice of 24 hours from the
Superintendent of Buildings, such Superintendent may enter upon the
premises and employ such labor, and furnish such materials and take
such steps as, in his judgment, may be necessary to prevent the same
from becoming unsafe or dangerous, at the expense of the person
whose duty it is to keep the same safe and secure. The Village of
Malverne or any person doing the work, or any part thereof, under and
by direction of the Superintendent of Buildings, may bring and maintain
an action against the person last herein referred to, to recover the value
of the work done and materials furnished in and about the premises, in
the same manner as if he had been employed to do the work by the
person. Alternatively; all costs incurred as a result of the excavation
process by the Village to protect and safeguard the area may be
assessed on the property tax roll in the event the owner has failed to
safeguard the area as requested by the Superintendent of Buildings.

inches or more in height, which is used to service the underside of the
lowest elevated floor. The elevation of the floor of this enclosed area, which
may be of soil, gravel, concrete or other material, must be equal to or above
the lowest adjacent exterior grade. The enclosed crawl space area shall be
properly vented to allow for the equalization of hydrostatic forces which
would be experienced during periods of flooding.

adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the
building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case
of Zone A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, or D, "elevated building" also
includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter
walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of
floodwaters. In the case of Zone V1-V30, VE, or V, "elevated building" also

The applicant shall provide the following information as appropriate;
additional information may be required on the permit application form:
A. Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for all
construction and other development to be undertaken in areas of
special flood hazard in this community for the purpose of protecting its
citizens from increased flood hazards and ensuring that new
development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its exposure to
flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any development in an area
of special flood hazard, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
enumerated in § 313-6, without a valid floodplain development permit.
Application for a permit shall be made on forms furnished by the local
administrator and may include, but not be limited to: plans, in
duplicate, drawn to scale and showing the nature, location, dimensions,
and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures,
fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the
foregoing.
B. Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be
accompanied by an application fee in an amount set from time to time
by resolution adopted by the Board of Trustees. In addition, the
applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing the Incorporated Village
of Malverne for any additional costs necessary for review, inspection
and approval of this project. The local administrator may require a
deposit of no more than $500 to cover these additional costs.63
A. The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor
(including basement or cellar) of any new or substantially improved
structure to be located in Zone A1-A30, AE or AH, or Zone A if base
flood elevation data are available. Upon completion of the lowest floor,
the permittee shall submit to the local administrator the as-built
elevation, certified by a licensed professional engineer or surveyor.

§ 313-13. Duties and responsibilities of local administrator.
Duties of the local administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the
following:
permittee shall submit to the local administrator the as-built
floodproofed elevation, certified by a professional engineer or surveyor.
C. A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that any
utility floodproofing will meet the criteria in § 313-15C, Utilities.
D. A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that any
nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the floodproofing
criteria in § 313-17, Nonresidential structures.
E. A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or
relocated as a result of proposed development. Computations by a
licensed professional engineer must be submitted that demonstrate
that the altered or relocated segment will provide equal or greater
conveyance than the original stream segment. The applicant must
submit any maps, computations or other material required by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the
documents enumerated in § 313-6, when notified by the local
administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose. The applicant must also provide assurances that the
conveyance capacity of the altered or relocated stream segment will be
maintained.
F. A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, if required by
the local administrator, which shows whether proposed development to
be located in an area of special flood hazard may result in physical
damage to any other property.
G. In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available from other
sources, base flood elevation data shall be provided by the permit
applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments
(including proposals for manufactured home and recreational vehicle
parks and subdivisions) that are greater than either 50 lots or five
acres.
A. Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the
following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(1) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 313-12, Application for permit, and for
compliance with the provisions and standards of this chapter.
(2) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks, to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard,

1:214
all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
applicable standards of Article V, Construction Standards and, in
particular, § 313-14A, Subdivision proposals.
(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special
flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property
(e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood velocities). The local
administrator may require the applicant to submit additional
technical analyses and data necessary to complete the
determination. If the proposed development may result in physical
damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
Article V, Construction Standards, no permit shall be issued. The
applicant may revise the application to include measures that
mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit the
application.
(4) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
state or federal law.
B. Use of other flood data.
(1) When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has designated
areas of special flood hazard on the community's Flood Insurance
Rate map (FIRM) but has neither produced water surface elevation
data (these areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM) nor
identified a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 313-12G, as criteria for requiring that new
construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meet the requirements of this chapter.
(2) When base flood elevation data are not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the purposes
of this chapter.
C. Alteration of watercourses. The local administrator shall:
(1) Notify adjacent communities and the New York State Department
of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting any alteration or
relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to the Regional Director, Region II, Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
(2) Determine that the permit holder has provided for maintenance
within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
D. Construction stage.
§ 313-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 313-13
1:215
(1) In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor or
completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially improved
structure, the local administrator shall obtain from the permit
holder a certification of the as-built elevation of the lowest floor or
floodproofed elevation, in relation to mean sea level. The certificate
shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a licensed
land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same. For
manufactured homes, the permit holder shall submit the certificate
of elevation upon placement of the structure on the site. A
certificate of elevation must also be submitted for a recreational
vehicle if it remains on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer
(unless it is fully licensed and ready for highway use).
(2) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval of
the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies detected
shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project unless
immediately corrected.
E. Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's engineer or
architect shall make periodic inspections at appropriate times
throughout the period of construction in order to monitor compliance
with permit conditions and enable said inspector to certify, if requested,
that the development is in compliance with the requirements of the
floodplain development permit and/or any variance provisions.
F. Stop-work orders.
(1) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found ongoing without a
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 313-8 of this chapter.
(2) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found noncompliant
with the provisions of this chapter and/or the conditions of the
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 313-8 of this chapter.
G. Certificate of compliance.
(1) In areas of special flood hazard, as determined by documents
enumerated in § 313-6, it shall be unlawful to occupy or to permit
the use or occupancy of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate
of compliance has been issued by the local administrator stating
that the building or land conforms to the requirements of this
chapter.
§ 313-13 MALVERNE CODE § 313-13
1:216
(2) A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the local
administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in
areas of special flood hazard.
(3) Issuance of the certificate shall be based upon the inspections
conducted as prescribed in Subsection E, Inspections, and/or any
certified elevations, hydraulic data, floodproofing, anchoring
requirements or encroachment analyses which may have been
required as a condition of the approved permit.
H. Information to be retained. The local administrator shall retain and
make available for inspection copies of the following:

Variance Procedure
§ 313-19. Appeals board.
A. The Board of Zoning Appeals as established by the Incorporated Village
of Malverne shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances
from the requirements of this chapter.
B. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the local administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
C. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals may
appeal such decision to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article 78 of the
Civil Practice Law and Rules.
D. In passing upon such applications, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter and:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program of that area;
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
(10) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with
conducting search and rescue operations during periods of
flooding;
§ 313-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 313-19
1:225
§ 313-20. Conditions for variances.
(11) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
(12) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including search and rescue operations,
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems and streets and bridges.
E. Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection D and the purposes of
this chapter, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such conditions to
the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes
of this chapter.
F. The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions,
including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, provided items (1) through (12)
in § 313-19D have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
(1) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure; and
(2) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D, E and F of this section are met;
and
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.
D. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
§ 313-19 MALVERNE CODE § 313-20
1:226
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
G. Notification.
(1) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
(a) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance
coverage; and
(b) Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property.
(2) Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance
actions as required in § 313-13H.

he deems necessary to address the emergency. Notwithstanding any other

§ 460-10. Bamboo. [Added 5-1-2013 by L.L. No. 4-2013]
A. Purpose. The planting or growing of bamboo has been determined to be
a community problem due to the destructive nature of the plant to
uproot asphalt, concrete and fences of adjoining property owners.
Bamboo has a remarkable ability to propagate and spread at an
alarming rate, causing harm to adjoining landowners. For this reason,
the Board of Trustees has determined it to be necessary to prohibit the
planting, growing or maintaining of bamboo on outdoor improved or
vacant unimproved property (excluding the inside of a residence as a
plant).
B. Prohibitions. It shall be unlawful for any owner, agent of such owner,
and/or any person, firm or corporation in possession of any improved
real property or vacant unimproved real property, excluding the
possession of a plant inside a residence, within the Village of Malverne,
to permit planting, growing and/or maintaining of bamboo, whether
originating on said property or encroaching thereon from any
neighboring property. The term "bamboo" shall be defined as any
tropical or semi-tropical grass of the genera Bambura, Dendrocalamus,
or of any other related genera.
C. Penalties for offenses.

the types and storage of garbage containers to prevent depredation by
animals and the prevention of unsanitary littering and certain

§ 500-20. Findings and purpose.
§ 500-21. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
RECYCLABLES  Discarded material which may be reclaimed, comprising
solid waste in the form of paper, glass, metals and plastics and which may
be further defined as follows:
A. The conservation of recyclable materials is now a necessity in order to
conserve natural resources, and the cost of solid waste disposal is ever
increasing and available residue disposal landfill facilities are rapidly
decreasing. It is therefore the intention of the Village of Malverne to
establish a program for the mandatory separation of recyclables from
garbage and rubbish within the Village. Such a program will reduce
both the amount of solid waste to be disposed of and the cost of landfill
disposal. In addition, the separation, collection and sale of recyclable
materials will reduce the financial burden of solid waste disposal on the
taxpayers of the Village of Malverne.
B. This article of the Code of the Village of Malverne shall regulate the
separation of recyclables by the residents of the Village in accordance
with the New York State Solid Waste Management Plan.
Paper, clean and unsoiled, including:
Newsprint, all newspapers and newspaper advertisements,
supplements, comics and enclosures.
(1)
(2) Magazines and telephone books.
Corrugated boxes, cardboard, cardboard cartons, pasteboard and
similar corrugated and kraft paper materials, provided that they
are free of foreign matter and refuse.

§ 507-1. Background and findings.
A. Background.
(1) In 1972, amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
prohibited the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters from a
point source unless authorized by a National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit. Improving water quality
under this program focused on industrial wastewater and
municipal sewage discharges. Once the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found an improvement in
pollution control of these point source discharges, it shifted its
regulatory focus to nonpoint source pollution, namely urban
stormwater runoff. A series of studies in the 1980s identified many
pollutants in stormwater discharges from a variety of sources,
including streets, parking lots, lawns, construction sites, highway
yards and other urban commercial and industrial uses. As a result,
in 1990 the EPA established Phase I stormwater regulations for
large communities with populations greater than 100,000 which
required National/State Pollution Discharge Elimination System
(N/SPDES) permits for certain municipal and industrial stormwater
discharges. In 1991 Phase II of these regulations was finalized,
requiring smaller communities within urbanized areas to develop
plans for the control of stormwater within their jurisdictions by
March 2003, with implementation by 2008.
(2) The Village of Malverne, as an operator of a municipal separate
stormwater system (MS4), is subject to these permitting
requirements as the State of New York Department of
Environmental Conservation has designated the Village as an
"Automatically Designated Urbanized Area." The initial step toward
providing a stormwater pollution prevention plan under Phase II is
to develop and implement six minimum measures, including public
education, public involvement, detection and elimination of illicit
connections, construction site runoff, post-construction stormwater
controls, pollution prevention and good housekeeping. This chapter
is intended to meet a number of these measures. The various
provisions of this chapter work to meet these objectives by
regulating the impacts of construction activity in the Village on soil
§ 500-30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 507-1
1:277
erosion and stormwater runoff. For most single-family residences,
stormwater runoff is managed with the installation of dry wells,
catch basins, driveway and/or curtain drains, or piping to nearby
existing municipal storm sewer systems. Typical erosion control
measures include the installation of silt fences and hay bales
around the property during construction.
(3) This chapter acknowledges the difference between large
construction projects typically requiring Planning Board site plan
or subdivision approval and more modest additions or
improvements by requiring more detailed information for the large
projects and basic information for the smaller projects.
B. Findings. The Board of Trustees of the Village of Malverne finds that
uncontrolled drainage and runoff associated with land development
have a significant impact upon the health, safety and welfare of the
community. Specifically:
(1) Stormwater runoff can carry pollutants into receiving water bodies,
degrading water quality.
(2) The increase in nutrients in stormwater runoff such as phosphorus
and nitrogen accelerates eutrophication of receiving waters.
(3) Improper design and construction of drainage facilities can
increase the velocity of runoff, thereby increasing stream bank
erosion and sedimentation.
(4) Construction involving land clearing and the alteration of natural
topography increases erosion.
(5) Siltation of water bodies resulting from increased erosion
decreases their capacity to hold and transport water, interferes
with navigation in downstream harbors, and harms flora and fauna.
(6) Sediment from soil erosion clogs catch basins, storm sewers and
ditches and pollutes and silts streams, rivers, lakes, reservoirs and
harbors.
(7) Impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of stormwater
runoff and allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow.
(8) Improperly managed stormwater runoff can increase the incidence
of flooding and the level of floods which occur, endangering
property and human life.
(9) Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts
on community waters.
(10) Many future problems can be avoided if land is developed with
sound stormwater runoff management practices.

income for the period covered thereby. Returns shall be filed with the
Village Treasurer on a form to be furnished by him for such purpose and

may require any utility doing business in the Village of Malverne to file an
annual return, which shall contain any data specified by him, regardless of

have annexed thereto an affidavit of the head of the utility making the same,

the return is required to be filed.
§ 523-6. Insufficient or unsatisfactory return; assessment.
A. In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the Village Treasurer, and if a corrected or sufficient
return is not filed within 20 days after the same is required by notice
from him or if no return is made for any period, the Village Treasurer
shall determine the amount of tax due from such information as he is
able to obtain, and, if necessary, may estimate the tax on the basis of
external indices or otherwise. He shall give notice of such
determination to the person liable for such tax. Such determination
shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax, unless the person against
whom it is assessed shall, within one year after the giving of notice of
such determination, apply to the Village Treasurer for a hearing, or
unless the Village Treasurer of his own motion shall reduce the same.
After such hearing, the Village Treasurer shall give notice of his
decision to the person liable for the tax. Such decision may be reviewed
by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of
the State of New York, if application therefor is made within 90 days
after the giving of notice of such decision. An order to review such
decision shall not be granted unless the amount of any tax sought to be
reviewed, with interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall be first
deposited with the Village Treasurer and an undertaking filed with him,
§ 523-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 523-6
1:317
§ 523-7. Notices.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may
be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended, in a
postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address given by him
in the last return filed by him under this article, or if no return has been
filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to
whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the
provisions of this article by the giving of notice shall commence to run from
the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 523-8. Penalties for offenses.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return or to pay any tax or
any portion thereof within the time required by this article shall be subject
to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due, plus 1% of such tax for each
month of delay or fraction thereof, except the first month, after such return
was required to be filed or such tax became due; but the Village Treasurer,
for cause shown, may extend the time for filing any return, and if satisfied
that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any portion of the penalty
fixed by the foregoing provisions of this section.
§ 523-9. Refunds.134
If, within one year from the giving of notice of any determination or
assessment of any tax or penalty, the person liable for the tax shall make
application for a refund thereof and the Village Treasurer or the court shall
determine that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof was erroneously
or illegally collected, the Village Treasurer shall refund the amount so
determined. For like cause and within the same period, a refund may be
so made on the initiative of the Village Treasurer. However, no refund shall
in such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme
Court shall approve, to the effect that, if such proceeding is dismissed
or the tax confirmed, the applicant will pay all costs and charges which
may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding, or, at the option of
the applicant, such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to cover the
tax, interest, penalties, costs and charges aforesaid, in which event the
applicant shall not be required to pay such tax, interest and penalties
as a condition precedent to such granting of such order.133
B. Except in the case of a willfully false or fraudulent return, with intent to
evade the tax, no bent of additional tax shall be made after the
expiration of more than three years from the date of the filing of a
return; provided, however, that where no return has been filed as
required by this article, the tax may be assessed at any time.

Treasurer as hereinbefore provided, unless the Village Treasurer, after a
hearing as hereinbefore provided, or of his own motion, shall have reduced
the tax or penalty, or it shall have been established in a proceeding under
Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the State of New York that
such determination was erroneous or illegal. All refunds shall be made out
of moneys collected under this article. An application for a refund, made
as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an application for the revision
of any tax or penalty complained of and the Village Treasurer may receive
additional evidence with respect thereto. After making his determination,
the Village Treasurer shall give notice thereof to the person interested, and
he shall be entitled to an order to review such determination under said
Article 78, subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained relating to the
granting of such an order.

article, the Village Attorney shall, upon the request of the Village Treasurer,
bring an action to enforce payment of the same. The proceeds of any
judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to the Village Treasurer.
Each such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person
liable to pay the same, in the same manner and to the same extent that the
tax and penalty imposed by § 186-a of the Tax Law is made a lien.
§ 523-12. Powers of Village Treasurer.
In the administration of this article, the Village Treasurer shall have power
to make such reasonable rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law,
as may be necessary for the exercise of his powers and the performance of

the court may require the production of, and may admit in evidence,
so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby as are pertinent
to the action or proceeding, and no more. Nothing herein shall be
construed to prohibit the delivery to a person or his duly authorized
representative of a copy of any return filed by him, nor to prohibit the
publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification
of particular returns and the items thereof, or the publication of

ARTICLE III
Tree Preservation
[Adopted 1-23-2003 by L.L. No. 2-2003 (Ch. 42A of the 1972 Code)]
§ 540-19. Legislative intent.
§ 540-20. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
CERTIFIED ARBORIST  An arborist or firm certified by the International
Society of Arboriculture, one of its chapters, or another nationally
recognized arboricultural organization.
HISTORIC OR UNIQUE VALUE  A quality of protected trees or shrubs
that may cause them to have a special role in the historic character of
the Village, and an incomparable or irreplaceable aesthetic benefit to the
community or environment, or may be listed as a rare or endangered plant
species on federal, state or other accredited plant registries.
PROTECTED SHRUB  Any established shrub with a height and/or spread
of six feet or more that has been found by the Board of Trustees, upon
recommendation by the Tree and Beautification Committee and after public
hearing, to have historic or unique value to the Village as defined herein.
A. The Village of Malverne finds that the existence of trees within the
Village makes a fundamental contribution to the health, safety and
general welfare of Malverne citizens. Trees, in addition to their
aesthetic benefits and temperature moderation, are essential to habitat,
wildlife, energy conservation, and the healthy ecology of the area, and
these benefits to the community and environment increase as trees
mature. Maturation of trees protects surface water quality, provides
shade, offers windbreaks, reduces soil erosion and flooding, offers a
natural barrier to noise and, together with shrubs, enhances the natural
beauty and appearance of the Village, and preserves its historic,
nonurban character.
B. Indiscriminate damage to and destruction of trees, especially mature
and/or specimen shrubs and trees, causes barren and unsightly
conditions, increases surface drainage problems, increases municipal
expense to control drainage, impairs the stability and value of
developed and undeveloped property, and adversely affects the health,
safety, environment, ecosystem, and general welfare of the inhabitants
of the Village of Malverne. The unregulated destruction of trees
contributes to the degradation of the natural beauty, environmental
quality and historic character of the Village.
C. This article seeks to promote the benefits described above by
promoting a healthy and mature tree and shrub population throughout
the Village for the benefit of its citizens and the environment.
§ 540-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 540-20
1:351
PROTECTED TREE  Any deciduous or evergreen perennial plant, usually
having one main stem or trunk and more or less definitely formed, whose
trunk has a diameter of nine inches or more (28 inches in circumference)
at a height of four feet measured from the uphill side. Protected trees shall
also include any tree, regardless of size, that has been found by the Board of
Trustees, upon recommendation by the Tree and Beautification Committee
and after public hearing, to have historic or unique value to the Village as
defined herein.
TREE AND BEAUTIFICATION COMMITTEE  As defined and created by
Article II, Trees in Public Areas, of this chapter (see § 540-4).
TREE REMOVAL PERMIT  A permit duly issued by the Village Clerk or
designee pursuant to the terms of this article.
§ 540-21. Cutting, killing or destroying protected trees and shrubs
prohibited; exceptions.
A. No person, firm, corporation or individual shall purposely, carelessly or
negligently cut down, kill or otherwise destroy any protected tree or
shrub or take any action that will result in the cutting down, killing or
otherwise destroying of any protected tree or shrub without first
obtaining a tree removal permit.
B. The provisions of Subsection A above shall not apply, however, if
destruction of any protected tree or shrub is necessary in response to
an emergency caused by an act of God or to protect the health and
safety of persons or property as determined by one or more members of
the Tree and Beautification Committee. If the destruction of a protected
tree or shrub is necessary to protect against an immediate threat to the
health and safety of persons or property, and a determination of such
threat cannot be made in a timely fashion by one or more members of
the Tree and Beautification Committee, then such protected tree or
shrub may be destroyed or removed; provided that within five days of
taking such action the Village Clerk is notified in writing that such
action has taken place. Such notice shall contain, at a minimum, a
completed tree removal permit application form as prescribed by the
Village Clerk, and a complete explanation of the circumstances and
conditions that gave rise to the emergency removal. Any removal of a
protected tree or shrub based on an unreasonable reliance on the
emergency provisions contained herein, as determined by the Village
Clerk, may subject the person removing or destroying such protected
tree or shrub or the person causing such removal or destruction to the
restoration requirement of § 540-24 and/or the penalties provided in
§ 540-26.
C. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, where protected
tree or shrub removal is proposed in connection with any site plan or
subdivision application submitted to the Planning Board, Board of
Zoning Appeals and/or Architectural Review Board for approval,
protected trees or shrubs may be removed from the affected property
§ 540-20 MALVERNE CODE § 540-21

§ 540-22. Granting of permits.
only in conjunction with and subsequent to the approval by the Planning
Board, Board of Zoning Appeals and/or Architectural Review Board of
a final subdivision plat or final site plan. The Planning Board, Board
of Zoning Appeals and/or Architectural Review Board applicant shall
not be required to obtain a tree removal permit. Rather, the Planning
Board, Board of Zoning Appeals and/or Architectural Review Board, in
connection with any site plan or subdivision application, may approve
or disapprove the removal of protected trees or shrubs on such terms
and conditions as it may prescribe, including but not limited to
requiring the planting of trees or shrubs to replace protected trees or
shrubs removed from the affected property as a condition of a final
site plan or subdivision application, moving or relocating proposed
structures to preserve trees or shrubs that the Planning Board, Board
of Zoning Appeals and/or Architectural Review Board deems to have
particular value. The Planning Board, Board of Zoning Appeals and/or
Architectural Review Board may refer such subdivision or site plans to
the Tree and Beautification Committee for its recommendations with
regard to the proposed removal of protected trees or shrubs or their
protection and preservation. If such referral is made, the Tree and
Beautification Committee shall respond to the Planning Board, Board of
Zoning Appeals and/or Architectural Review Board within 21 days.
D. If the Building Inspector, Superintendent of Public Works or any other
Village employee, in the course of their duties, becomes aware of a plan
that may result in a violation of this article, notice of such plan shall
promptly be made to the Tree and Beautification Committee.
A. Permits for the removal of protected trees or shrubs may be granted
under the following circumstances:
(1) That the protected trees or shrubs are dead or diseased to the
extent that they cannot, or should not, consistent with good and
accepted arboricultural practices, be saved, or that the removal of
the protected trees or shrubs is otherwise necessary due to their
health or physical condition, according to good and accepted
arboricultural practices. To this effect, a written statement of a
certified arborist, obtained and paid for by the applicant, may be
required by Tree and Beautification Committee of any applicant
who proposes to destroy any protected tree or shrub.
(2) That the presence of protected trees or shrubs causes undue
hardship or danger for the person or property of the owner, or
danger to the public, to public property or to the person or property
of an adjoining property owner. Such danger shall include damage
caused to any public sidewalk and/or roadway which may cause a
tripping hazard.
§ 540-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 540-22
1:353
§ 540-23. Procedural requirements for permit; revocation.
(3) That protected trees or shrubs are within 10 feet of the perimeter
of existing or planned buildings or structures for which a valid
building permit or certificate of occupancy has been issued.
(4) That protected trees or shrubs substantially interfere with a
permitted and intended use of the property.
(5) That the property owner has an approved permit to fill or
relandscape, and that such filling or relandscaping, in the opinion
of the Tree and Beautification Committee, shall lead to the demise
of protected trees or shrubs.
B. The Village may, as a condition to granting the application for a permit,
require the applicant to replace any protected tree or shrub which is
the subject of the application with a replacement tree or shrub under
conditions specified in the issued permit. Such replacement shall be
performed in accordance with the provisions of § 540-24, Subsections
B, C, and D.
A. All applications for tree removal permits hereunder must be made in
writing upon forms prescribed by the Village Clerk by the owner or duly
authorized representative of the owner of the property on which such
protected tree or shrub is located. There shall be no fee associated with
such a permit application.
B. All applications for tree removal permits shall be referred by the Village
Clerk to the Tree and Beautification Committee for review. Permits will
be granted in accordance with § 540-22 and Article II, Trees in Public
Areas, of this chapter.
C. The application shall include the types and sizes of trees or shrubs to be
removed and destroyed, the reasons for removing or destroying said
trees or shrubs, and a plan clearly indicating the location of the
property and the trees or shrubs to be destroyed.
D. Where five or more tree cuttings are planned for relandscaping, a
landscape design plan indicating the species and location of
replacement plantings must also be attached to the application. If 10 or
more protected tree or shrub cuttings are planned, the applicant may
be required to pay for an inspector, to be assigned by the Village, to
supervise the orderly development of the land and ensure the
protection of the trees.
E. The applicant may be required to furnish additional relevant
information if necessary to a determination of the permit application.
F. The application for a permit shall provide for the permission of the
property owner for members of the Tree and Beautification Committee
to enter onto the applicant's property and inspect protected trees or
shrubs to be destroyed, and such member(s) may be accompanied by a

certified arborist. In the event of such an inspection, protected trees or
shrubs to be destroyed shall be clearly identified with a bright-colored
ribbon, spray paint or other identifying mark. Such on-site inspection
shall be conducted at a reasonable time, and no more than three such
on-site inspections shall occur without the subsequent approval of the
property owner.
G. Within 40 days from the date a complete application is submitted, the
Tree and Beautification Committee shall make its decision on the
application and the Village shall thereupon issue or deny the permit
request. The failure to act upon the application for a tree removal
permit within 40 days shall be deemed a granting of the tree removal
permit.
H. The Village may revoke any duly issued tree removal permit if the work
proposed in the application is not proceeding in an orderly and diligent
manner, in accordance with good and acceptable arboricultural
practice, or if destruction of protected trees or shrubs not proposed in
the tree removal permit is undertaken.
A. All persons who remove or cause to be removed protected trees or
shrubs without first obtaining the required permit under this article
may be required by the Village to plant one or more replacement trees
or shrubs on the property which are of like kind, quality and size. When
like-sized replacement is not practical, replacement with a specific
quantity of smaller-size trees or shrubs may be required. When
restoration is determined by the Village to be impractical or
undesirable, an additional fine may be imposed in accordance with the
provisions of § 540-26.
B. All restorative work shall be done in accordance with good and
acceptable planting and tree surgery practice.
C. All trees that fail to survive as a result of the restoration work required
under this section for a period of two calendar years following planting
shall be replaced by the owner of the land. Said replacement shall be
within 60 days following written demand from the Village for such
replacement, or within an extended period of time as may be specified.
Should the property owner fail to replace the trees pursuant to demand
within the required period of time, the Village has the right to impose
penalties as set forth in § 540-26 of this chapter.
D. All tree planting, tree dressing and associated restoration work must be
substantially completed within six months from the date of issuance of
the decision of the Tree and Beautification Committee; except that the
time may be extended by the Building Inspector, whose decision shall
be subject to appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
§ 540-23 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 540-25
1:355
§ 540-25. Certificates of occupancy.
No certificate of occupancy shall be issued by the Building Inspector until
all tree planting, tree dressing and associated restoration work shall be
completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the Building Inspector or
designee. In the event seasonal planting requirements prevent the timely
completion of all planting and restoration work, the Building Inspector may
issue a certificate of occupancy together with prescribed conditions.
§ 540-26. Enforcement; penalties for offenses.
Any person, corporation, company, partnership, firm or other legal entity
violating any of the provisions of this article shall commit an offense,
the fine for which shall not exceed $250 for each offense. The removal,
destroying or killing of each protected tree or shrub shall constitute a
separate offense. In addition, any person, firm or corporation violating any
provision of this article may be required to replace such protected tree or
shrub with one of similar size and quality as provided in this chapter. When
restoration is determined by the Village to be impractical or undesirable, an
additional fine may be imposed in an amount not to exceed $1,000.
§ 540-27. Work done on Village property.
No Village department, agency, commission or authority in the Village of
Malverne, or any employee of the Village, or any firm or individual retained
by the Village shall propose to or shall cut down, kill or otherwise destroy
more than 10 protected trees or shrubs in any Village park or on other
Village property, with the exception of Village highways, within the Village
of Malverne, without first providing written notice to the Village Board of
Trustees. The Board of Trustees may consult the Tree and Beautification
Committee and ask for its recommendation on the destruction of said
protected trees or shrubs, and the determination of the Village Board of
Trustees concerning their destruction shall be final.
§ 540-28. Appeals.
Any property owner who is the subject of any decision under this article
by the Tree and Beautification Committee, the Village Clerk or the Building
Inspector may, within 30 days of receiving such decision, appeal such
decision to the Village Board of Zoning Appeals. The decision of the Village
Board of Zoning Appeals on any such appeal shall be deemed to be the final
decision of the Village of Malverne.
§ 540-29. Utility easements.
Nothing in this article should be construed to interfere with the right of any
public utility to enforce or act with any preexisting utility easements created
by law or agreement.

Conservation
[Adopted 12-2-1987 by L.L. No. 8-1987]
§ 586-4. Legislative findings.
It is the determination of the Board of Trustees, based upon a study
conducted on behalf of the Board of Supervisors of the County of Nassau,
that circumstances exist with respect to the sufficiency of water supply
within Nassau County which pose a potential threat to the safety and
well-being of its citizens. Accordingly, the Board of Trustees does adopt
applicable provisions of the Nassau County Comprehensive Management/
Conservation Program which is designed to regulate or limit the use of
water throughout the county, including the towns, cities, villages and
special districts, and provide for enforcement of such program since it is
the policy of the Village to conserve, protect and manage the waters within
its jurisdiction. This determination has been made in connection with the
action of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation
in imposing restrictions in 1986 and in view of the fact that the water
supply in Nassau County is dependent upon a sole-source aquifer system
which serves domestic, industrial, commercial and/or recreational needs
of individuals in the county, and the Board further finds that, due to the
sensitivity of the aquifer system, certain limitations are necessary to curb
water withdrawals in order to ensure a long-term water supply.

§ 586-6. Car washes and fleet maintenance.
A. During the hours of 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., no person shall water, hose,

addresses may water, hose sprinkle or otherwise irrigate
other than during the above hours on even-numbered days of the
month.
(2) Persons occupying residences or other establishments with oddnumbered
addresses may water, hose sprinkle or otherwise irrigate
other than during the above hours on odd-numbered days of the
month.
(3) Persons occupying residences or other establishments without
numbered addresses may water, hose sprinkle or otherwise irrigate
other than during the above hours on even-numbered days of the
month.

irrigation of any sort which is done by means of water obtained from
sources other than the Nassau County sole-source aquifer system.150

§ 600-2.0. Designated titles.
For the purposes of this chapter, the Village of Malverne is hereby divided
into six districts, which shall be designated as follows:
§ 600-2.1. Boundaries; Zoning Map.

A. Residence A District.
B. Residence B District.
C. Residence C District.
D. Residence D District.
E. Business District.
F. Commercial District.
A. The boundaries of said districts shall be as shown upon the map on file
in the Village Office, which shall be designated as the "Building Zone
Map of the Village of Malverne, Nassau County, New York." Said map
and all notations, references and other things shown thereon shall be as
much a part of this chapter as if the matters and things shown by said
map were all fully described herein.
B. The boundaries between districts are, unless otherwise indicated,
either the center lines of streets or railroad rights-of-way or such lines
extended or lines parallel thereto. Where figures are shown on the
Zoning Map between a street and district boundary line, they indicate
that the district boundary line runs parallel to the street line at a
distance therefrom equivalent to the number of feet so indicated. When
the location of a district boundary is not otherwise determined, it shall
be determined by the scale of the map measured from a given line.
Where the street layout actually on the ground varies from the street
layout as shown on the Building Zone Map, the designation shown on
the mapped street shall apply in such a way as to carry out the intent
and the purposes of this chapter for the particular area in question.
C. Where a district boundary line divides a lot held in single ownership at
the time of the passage of this chapter, the Zoning Board of Appeals, as
hereinafter provided, may permit the less restricted use to extend to
the whole or any part of such lot.

(1) Intent. The Board of Trustees recognizes that there are some uses

characteristics. These objectionable characteristics are heightened
by their concentration in any one area, thereby having deleterious
effects on adjacent areas. Special regulation of these uses is
necessary to prevent their adverse effects. The Board of Trustees
further finds that the location of these uses in regard to areas
where our youth may regularly assemble and the general
atmosphere of their operation are of great concern to the Village of
Malverne. Special regulations are itemized in this subsection to
accomplish the primary purposes of preventing the deleterious
effects of adult uses.
(2) Definitions. As used in this chapter, the following terms shall be
defined as follows:

conformity with the regulations prescribed by this chapter for the district in
which such building is located.
§ 600-3.0 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-3.6
1:393
§ 600-3.6. Authority to determine legal nonconforming uses.
The Zoning Board of Appeals may, after public hearing on the written
verified application of the owner of property claiming a legal nonconforming
use thereon, confirm such use by determining that such use is, in fact, a
legal nonconforming use.
A. Evidence to accompany application to determine legal nonconforming
use. Every application under this section shall state or be accompanied
by an affidavit or affidavits stating the evidentiary facts claimed to
establish such use as a legal nonconforming use and shall be filed in
duplicate with the Zoning Board of Appeals. The Zoning Board of
Appeals may, in its discretion, require the production of additional
evidence and may make whatever independent investigation it may
deem necessary.
B. Confirmation or denial of legal nonconforming use. The Zoning Board of
Appeals, upon the evidence submitted to and obtained by it, shall make
and file with the Village Clerk a written determination confirming or
denying the legal nonconforming use and stating the facts which it finds
to be established by such evidence, the basis of such findings and the
conclusions it has drawn from such findings.

nonconforming use pursuant to this section, the Superintendent of

confirmed, and such certificate shall constitute presumptive
evidence that such use is a legal nonconforming use in any action
or proceeding brought to enforce this chapter.
(2) Every nonconforming use for which a certificate of occupancy has
not been issued, as provided in this section, shall be an illegal
nonconforming use for the purpose of any application to or
proceeding before any officer or board of the Village.
D. Effect of section.
(1) Nothing in this article shall be deemed to make legal or to permit
the confirmation of any nonconforming use which is not a legal
nonconforming use or to invalidate the use of or require the
confirmation of the use of any land, building or structure for which
a valid certificate of occupancy has been issued prior to and is in
effect on the effective date of this chapter.
(2) All the foregoing provisions relating to nonconforming uses and
buildings shall apply to all nonconforming uses and buildings
existing at the time of the effective date of this chapter and to all
uses and buildings that become nonconforming by reason of any
amendment thereof.
§ 600-3.6 MALVERNE CODE § 600-3.6
1:394
(3) The existence of a nonconforming use or building or the application
thereto of the limitations set forth in this section shall not be
deemed to result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship
warranting any variance in the strict application of any of the
provisions of this chapter to such nonconforming use or building or
to the land on which it is located. It is the intention of this chapter
that such vested rights as pertain to any nonconforming use or
building shall remain unimpaired but that the same shall not be

be provided within 300 feet of the building they are intended to
serve, measured between the nearest point of the off-street parking
facilities and the nearest point of the building. All such parking
spaces shall be owned, leased or otherwise under the control of the
user of the nonresidential use.

provision is made. Parking areas shall be designed to permit each motor
vehicle to proceed to and from the parking space provided for it without
requiring the moving of any other motor vehicles.
G. Notwithstanding the requirements herein, whenever a building existing
at the time of the adoption of this article shall be structurally altered or
added to in an amount less than 10% of its total floor area, only that
portion of the area of the existing building which has been structurally
altered or added to need comply with the Schedule of Minimum Spaces

A. Municipal parking within 300 feet of the building may be used to satisfy
all or part of the parking requirements, subject to the approval of the
Board of Trustees in connection with site plan and/or parking plan
approval. Before approving any waiver of parking requirements
pursuant hereto, the Board of Trustees shall find that such waiver will
not:
(1) Cause undue congestion on adjoining streets;
(2) Limit the accessibility of the property for fire and police protection;
and
(3) Be detrimental to the neighborhood.
B. Prior to making such findings and granting any waiver pursuant hereto,

advisory reports from the Village Traffic Commission, Police
Commissioner, Fire Chief or other Village officials or agencies.

Applications and Permits
§ 600-5.0. Building permits.
A. No building or structure shall be erected, enlarged, extended, altered,

copies of specifications for the construction covered by the application.
D. Said plan for any building or structure and said plot plan shall be drawn
to scale by an architect or professional engineer licensed to practice in
the State of New York and his or her seal affixed thereto; provided,
however, that said plan for any building or structure and said plot plan
need not be drawn by such an architect or engineer if the application is
for a permit for the alteration or extension of a building or structure and
the Superintendent of Buildings finds, and so endorses on the plan for
such building or structure and the plot plan, that the proposed
construction would not affect the structural safety of the building or the
safety of the occupants thereof.
E. Said plan for such building or structure and said plot plan shall show
exactly the following:
(1) The lines, angles and dimensions of the lot.
(2) The location and dimensions of any existing building or structure,
including any porch or accessory building on the lot.

H. Building permit approval shall automatically terminate one year after
the building permit is issued unless there is physical evidence to
demonstrate that substantial construction has taken place and is
continuing. Upon application to the Superintendent of Buildings, and
submission of an application fee, which shall be set from time to time by
resolution of the Board of Trustees, the building permit approval may
be extended for two additional six-month periods, if the Superintendent
of Buildings determines, in his sole discretion, that there is evidence to
demonstrate that substantial action has been taken in connection with
the proposed construction or development and such is continuing. The
Board of Trustees may, upon written application, extend the building
permit approval for additional one-year terms upon finding, in its sole
discretion, that there is evidence to demonstrate that substantial action

all respects in conformity with the provisions of this chapter and all
other applicable laws and ordinances, said certificate shall be issued by

§ 600-5.0 MALVERNE CODE § 600-5.1
1:404
(1) Written application for such certificate for a building shall be made
at the same time as the application for the building permit for such
building.
(2) Upon the request of the Superintendent of Buildings, and prior to
the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or certificate of
compliance, there shall be filed with the Village Clerk an affidavit of
the registered architect or licensed professional engineer who filed
the original plans, or of the registered architect or licensed
professional engineer who supervised the construction of the work
for which the certificate of occupancy or certificate of compliance
is sought. This affidavit shall state that the affiant has examined the
approved plans of the structure for which the certificate of
occupancy, or certificate of compliance is sought, and that the
structure has been erected in accordance with the approved plans.
(3) No building or structure for which a certificate of occupancy, or a
certificate of compliance, is required under the provisions of this
section or any other provision of law, or of this or any other
regulations, local law or rule of the Village, shall be used or
occupied until the Superintendent of Buildings has issued a
certificate of temporary use therefor, or, in the event of his refusal
to issue same for reasons of safety, until the issuance of the
certificate of completion or certificate of occupancy required by
this section. The Superintendent of Buildings is hereby authorized
to issue any such certificate of temporary use, or a temporary
certificate of occupancy, if, in the opinion of the Superintendent of
Buildings, such certificate would not expose any person to such
hazards during completion of construction as to endanger the life,
health or safety of any such person, provided that the duration of
such certificate of temporary use or temporary certificate of
occupancy shall not exceed six months. The Superintendent of
Buildings may extend the certificate of temporary use or the
temporary certificate of occupancy for up to six months. Such
temporary certificate shall not be construed as in any way altering
the respective rights, duties or obligations of the owner or of the
Village relating to the use or occupancy of the land or building or
any other matter covered by this chapter.
C. If an improvement was made prior to the requirement for either a
certificate of occupancy or compliance, the Superintendent of Buildings
may issue a letter-in-lieu confirming that the improvement was made
prior to the requirements for a certificate of occupancy or compliance,
provided that the Superintendent of Buildings can confirm that the
improvement was made prior to such requirement.
D. In the case of any change in the use or occupancy, or in the case of any
new construction, alteration, erection, modification, enlargement, or
addition, or other change to an existing building or structure subject to
the terms of this or any other regulation, local law or ordinance of the
Village or of the State of New York, no certificate of occupancy or
§ 600-5.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-5.1
1:405
certificate of compliance shall be issued, or amended, before the
Superintendent of Buildings shall examine or cause to be examined all
buildings, structures and sites for which an application has been filed
for a permit for a change in the use or type of occupancy, or in the
case of any new construction, or in the case of any alteration, erection,
modification, reconstruction, addition, or other change to an existing
building or structure; and the Superintendent of Buildings may conduct
such inspections as he or she deems appropriate from time to time
during and upon completion of the work for which a building permit has
been issued.
E. In the event that an inspection required by this section reveals
violations of any provision of this Municipal Code or of the New York
Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code, or of any other building,
plumbing or zoning regulation of the Village, then a notice of violation
shall be issued to the owner of the premises and said owners shall have
30 days to remove or correct said violation(s) or, failing same, an
application for any certificate under the provisions of this section shall
be denied and a summons or appearance ticket issued for such
violation(s).
F. Applications for a certificate of occupancy, or certificate of compliance,
or for a letter-in-lieu thereof, as the case may be, shall be made on
forms provided therefor by the Superintendent of Buildings' office. Said
applications shall be accompanied at the time of filing by an application
and inspection fee in an amount established, from time to time, by
resolution of the Board of Trustees and by a copy of an up-to-date
property survey or, in lieu thereof, a copy of an existing survey updated
by a survey inspection.
G. In the event that any person(s) other than the owner of the premises
shall apply for a certificate required by this section, such person shall
provide satisfactory evidence that he is acting as the attorney-in-fact or
lawful agent of the actual owner, or shall submit an authorization from
said owner, duly executed and acknowledged by him, stating that said
other person is authorized to act on his behalf. Absent such evidence, in
form satisfactory to the Village Clerk at the time of applying therefor, no
application for the processing of such certificates shall be filed or
accepted by the Village.
H. Whenever there are reasonable grounds to believe that any material,
construction, equipment or assembly does not conform to any
regulation, rule, ordinance, or law of the Village of Malverne, the
Superintendent of Buildings may require the same to be subjected to
tests, at the owner's expense, in order to furnish proof of such
compliance.
I. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, an owner, anyone
acting on behalf of the owner or any other person shall be entitled to
obtain a photocopy of a previously issued certificate of occupancy,
certificate of completion or letter-in-lieu thereof as a copy of a public

record; provided, however, that in such event the Superintendent of
Buildings shall endorse on said photocopy a statement indicating that
no reliance may be placed on the legal validity of said certificate or
letter, as the case may be, from the date of original issuance appearing,
thereon, unless and until such certificate or letter has been revalidated
by the Superintendent of Buildings, as provided in this section.
J. No certificate of occupancy shall be deemed to validate any violation of
any provisions of this or any other law or ordinance.
K. The Superintendent of Buildings shall index all building code, zoning
code, and other violations issued by the Superintendent of Buildings, or
by those acting at his direction, against the records maintained for
certificates of occupancy by the Building Department, and any such
violations shall be listed when any request is made for a certificate of
occupancy, a certificate of compliance, or for a letter-in-lieu thereof.
L. Applicant shall be required to pay those fees as set forth from time to
time by resolution of Board of Trustees.

permit, the Board of Trustees shall hold a public hearing after due
notice. Notice shall be provided by applicant to all those record owners
within 200 feet of the property which is the subject of the application by
certified mail, return receipt requested, no less than 15 days and no
more than 25 days before the hearing. Proof of service shall be
presented at the public hearing. In addition, the Village Clerk shall
cause to be published notice of the hearing not less than 10 days prior
to the hearing date.
C. Standards. The Board of Trustees, in its consideration of and decision
on an application for a special use permit, shall be guided (without
limitations) by the following standards and considerations:
§ 600-5.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-5.2
1:407
(1) The purposes of zoning set forth in the Village Law of the State of
New York.
(2) That the proposed use is of such character, size, location, design
and site layout as to be appropriate to and in harmony with the
surrounding properties, the neighborhood and the Village.
(3) That the proposed use is or will be necessary or desirable to the
neighborhood or Village in that it will provide a service, facility or
convenience or otherwise contribute to the proper growth and
development of the community and to its general welfare.
(4) That the proposed use shall not be hazardous, inconvenient,
conflicting or incongruous to the surroundings, neighborhood or
Village by reason of excessive traffic, assembly of persons or
vehicles, proximity to normal travel routes or congregation of
children or pedestrians.
(5) That the location and size of the use, the nature and intensity of the
operations involved in or conducted in connection with it, its site
layout and its relation to streets giving access to it will not be
hazardous or inconvenient to the residential character of the
neighborhood or conflict with the normal traffic on the residential
streets.
(6) That the proposed use, site layout, location, heights, signs, walls,
fences and landscaping will not hinder or discourage the
appropriate use and development of adjacent uses or impair the
value thereof.
(7) That the proposed use, site layout, location, size or operation will
not be objectionable to nearby dwellings by reason of noise, lights
or impacts.
(8) That the proposed use, location, size, site layout and nature of use
will be a harmonious part of the district in which it is to be situated.
(9) That the location and size of the use, the nature and intensity of the
operations in or conducted in connection with it, its site layout and
its relation to streets giving access to it will be such that vehicular
traffic will not be more hazardous than the normal traffic of the
district, taking into account such factors as street intersections,
traffic flow, sight distances and pedestrian traffic.
D. Authority.
(1) The Board of Trustees, pursuant to this section, may authorize a
special use permit and, furthermore, may impose such conditions,
modifications and safeguards as it deems appropriate, necessary or
desirable to preserve the intent of this chapter.
§ 600-5.2 MALVERNE CODE § 600-5.2

and the submission of an application fee, which shall be set from time to
time by resolution of the Board of Trustees, to the Superintendent of
Buildings, the special use permit may be extended for two additional
six-month periods, upon good cause shown. The Board of Trustees may,
upon written application, extend the special use permit for additional
one-year terms upon good cause shown. No extension shall be granted
by the Board of Trustees unless the applicant has paid an extension fee
in an amount set by the Board of Trustees.
F. Extinguishment of special use permit. Whenever a use established
pursuant to a special use permit shall have been abandoned for a term
of six months, or whenever the location of such a use is substantially
destroyed, the land, building or structure in which said use shall have
existed shall not thereafter be used for the previously established
special use. The use shall not be abandoned if, within the six-month
term, the use shall be reestablished for a period of at least 30 days. A
use shall be substantially destroyed if the cost to repair and replace the
structure exceeds 50% of the current structural replacement value
thereof. Any use that has been extinguished as a result of abandonment
or destruction as set forth herein may be reinstated within two years of
extinguishment by special use permit by the Board of Trustees.
G. Revocation of special use permit. Any special use permit granted
pursuant to this chapter shall be revocable on the order of the Board of
Trustees at any time upon the failure of the owner or the operator of the
use or structure covered by the special use permit to observe all
requirements of this chapter with respect to the maintenance and

use of any other remedy prescribed by law or by this chapter or of
any conditions of the special use permit. The violation of any condition

also constitute a violation of this chapter.
H. Reimbursement of expenses required. All applicants under this article
shall be required to pay the cost associated with engineering,
environmental, architectural, legal and other consulting professionals
retained by or on behalf of the Village. No special use permit shall be
issued until the applicant reimburses the Village for all such fees and
expenses. At the time of application, and throughout the review
process, the Superintendent of Buildings may require applicant to
deposit with the Village Clerk such amounts to cover such fees and
expenses. In instances where such expenses are minimal, the
requirement for reimbursement of expenses may be waived by the
Board of Trustees.

reconstructed, altered, converted, located or maintained, or any
building, structure, land or premises is used in violation of this chapter,
any regulation or requirement made pursuant thereto, or under the
authorization conferred thereby or is in violation of any other applicable
law or regulation, in addition to other lawful remedies, the Board of
Trustees or, with its approval, the Code Enforcement Officer may,
pursuant to the New York Village Law, institute any appropriate action
or proceedings to prevent such unlawful erection, construction,
alteration, conversion, repair, maintenance or use; to restrain, correct
or abate such violation; to prevent the occupancy or residency of such
building, land or premises or to prevent any illegal act, conduct,
business or use in or about such premises; or to promote public safety
and protect the general welfare of those individuals in and about the
premises.
B. Discovery of violation. The Code Enforcement Officer shall determine
the existence of violations of the provisions of this article through such
investigations as he or she shall conduct pursuant to the issuance of

investigation of such written complaints as are filed with him or her by
§ 600-5.2 MALVERNE CODE § 600-5.4

A. There shall be a Zoning Board of Appeals established in accordance
with the provisions of the Village Law of the State of New York. Said
Board shall consist of five members and two alternate members and
shall be appointed as provided by statute.
B. Alternate members.
(1) Appointment. Alternate members of the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall be appointed by the Mayor subject to the approval of the
Board of Trustees for a term of one year. A maximum of two
alternate members may be appointed. Each alternate member shall
be designated as either "First Alternate" or "Second Alternate," and
each shall be called upon to serve on a rotation basis when a
member is absent or unable to participate on an application or
matter before the Board.
(2) Notice. Alternate members shall be given notice of and shall be
encouraged to attend all meetings of such Board.
(3) Designation. The Chairperson of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
immediately designate an alternate to substitute for a member
when such member is unable to participate on an application or
matter before the Board. Alternates shall be designated in order of
priority. If an alternate member is not available to serve on a date
when such alternate member is called to serve, then the next
alternate member shall be called to serve. The alternate member
not able to serve shall next serve when that alternate's time comes
around on the rotation. When so designated, the alternate member
shall possess all the powers and responsibilities of such member of
the Board. Such designation shall be entered into the minutes of
the initial Zoning Board of Appeals meeting at which the
substitution is made.
(4) New York State law controlling. All provisions of state law relating
to Zoning Board of Appeals member eligibility, vacancy in office,
removal, compatibility of office and service on other boards, as well
as any education, compensation and attendance, shall also apply to
alternate members.
(5) Supersession of Village law. This section is hereby adopted
pursuant to the provision of § 10 of the New York State Municipal
Home Rule Law. It is the intent of the Board of Trustees, pursuant
to § 10 of the New York State Municipal Home Rule Law, to
supersede the provisions of § 7-712 et seq. of the Village Law
relating to the appointment of members to the Village Zoning
Board of Appeals.
§ 600-6.0 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-6.1
1:413
§ 600-6.1. Powers and duties.
A. General.
(1) The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have all the powers and duties
prescribed by law and by this chapter, which are more particularly
specified as follows, provided that none of the following provisions
shall be deemed to limit any power of the Board conferred upon it
by law.
(2) Interpretation. Upon appeal from a decision of a Code Enforcement
Officer, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power to decide
any question involving the interpretation of any provision of this
chapter, including determination of the exact location of any
district boundary if there is uncertainty with respect thereto.
(3) Nonconforming uses. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the
power to confirm the existence of a nonconforming use.
(4) The Zoning Board of Appeals, on appeal from the decision or
determination of the Code Enforcement Officer charged with the
enforcement of this chapter, shall have the power to grant use and
other area variances, as defined herein.
(5) The Zoning Board of Appeals shall, in the granting of both use
variances and area variances, have the authority to impose such
reasonable conditions and restrictions as are directly related to and
incidental to the proposed use of the property. Such conditions
shall be consistent with the spirit and intent of this chapter and
shall be imposed for the purpose of minimizing any adverse impact
such variance may have on the neighborhood or community.
B. Use variances.
(1) "Use variance" shall mean the authorization by the Zoning Board of
Appeals for the use of land for a purpose which is otherwise not
permitted or is prohibited by the applicable zoning regulations.
(2) No such use variance shall be granted by the Zoning Board of
Appeals without a showing by the applicant that applicable zoning
regulations and restrictions have caused unnecessary hardship. In
order to prove such unnecessary hardship, the applicant shall
demonstrate to the Zoning Board of Appeals that for each and
every permitted use under the zoning regulations for the particular
district where the property is located:
(a) The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided that
the lack of return is substantial as demonstrated by competent
financial evidence;
(b) That the alleged hardship relating to the property in question
is unique and does not apply to a substantial portion of the
district or neighborhood;
§ 600-6.1 MALVERNE CODE § 600-6.1
1:414
(c) That the requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood; and
(d) That the alleged hardship has not been self-created.
(3) The Zoning Board of Appeals, in the granting of use variances, shall
grant the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and
adequate to address the unnecessary hardship demonstrated by
the applicant, and at the same time preserve and protect the
character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of
the community.
C. Area variances.
(1) "Area variance" shall mean the authorization by the Zoning Board
of Appeals for the use of land in a manner which is not permitted or
is prohibited by the dimensional or physical requirements of the
applicable zoning regulations.
(2) In making its determination, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall take
into consideration the benefit to the applicant if the variance is
granted, as weighed against the detriment to the health, safety and
welfare of the neighborhood or community by such grant. In
making such determination, the Board shall consider:
(a) Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the
character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby
properties will be created by the granting of the area variance;
(b) Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved
by some alternative method, feasible for the applicant to
pursue, other than an area variance;
(c) Whether the requested area variance is substantial;
(d) Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect or
impact on the physical or environmental conditions in the
neighborhood or district; and
(e) Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which
consideration shall be relevant to the decision of the Zoning
Board of Appeals, but shall not in and of itself necessarily
preclude the granting of the area variance.
(3) The Zoning Board of Appeals, in the granting of area variances,
shall grant the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and
adequate and at the same time preserve and protect the character
of the neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the
community.
D. Revocation, expiration and extinguishment of variances.
§ 600-6.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-6.1
1:415
(1) Revocation of variances. Any variances granted pursuant to this
chapter shall be revocable on the order of the Zoning Board of
Appeals at any time upon the failure of the owner or operator of the
use or structure, covered by the variance, to observe all
requirements of this chapter with respect to the maintenance and
conduct of the use or structure, or upon the failure to observe all
conditions and restrictions of such variance which were designated
by the Zoning Board of Appeals in issuing the same. Prior to
revoking any such variance, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall give
the holder of the variance at least 10 days' written notice of
violation. If within such 10 days the variance holder so requests,
the Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a hearing on the revocation
of such variance and shall give at least 10 days' written notice of
the hearing either by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by
personal service. If no hearing is requested within the ten-day
notice-of-violation period, the variance shall, upon the expiration of
such period, be immediately revoked and a new application for the
relief previously granted shall be required. The foregoing
provisions shall not be deemed to preclude the use of any other
remedy prescribed by law or by this chapter with respect to
violations of the provisions of this chapter or of any conditions of
the variance. The violation of any condition imposed by the Zoning
Board of Appeals as part of a variance or the variance holder's
failure to observe all the requirements of this chapter with respect
to maintenance and conduct of the use shall also constitute a
violation of this chapter.
(2) Expiration, lapse, extension and reinstatement of variance. Any
variance granted pursuant to this chapter shall automatically
expire and be of no further force and effect one year after the
granting thereof unless, within such one-year period, substantial
construction shall have been commenced. All construction must be
completed within one year of the date of commencement of
substantial construction. If construction is not completed within
the one-year period, the variance shall automatically expire and be
of no further force and effect. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall be
authorized, upon application and submission of an extension fee,
and without hearing, to grant extensions of the variance for
additional periods, each not to exceed six months, or to reinstate a
lapsed variance for good cause shown. No extension or restatement
shall be granted unless the applicant has paid the extension fee.
(3) Extinguishment of variance. Whenever a use established pursuant
to a variance shall have been abandoned for a term of six months,
or whenever the location of such use is substantially destroyed, the
land, building or structure in which said use shall have existed shall
not thereafter be used for the previously established use. The use
shall not be abandoned if, within the six-month term, the use shall
be reestablished for a period of at least 30 days. A structure shall
be "substantially destroyed" if the cost to repair and replace the
§ 600-6.1 MALVERNE CODE § 600-6.1
1:416
§ 600-6.2. Procedure.
structure exceeds 50% of the current structural replacement value
thereof. Any variance which shall have been extinguished as a
result of abandonment or destruction as set forth herein may be
reinstated within two years of extinguishment following an
application to the Zoning Board of Appeals, upon good cause
shown.
A. All appeals and applications made to the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
be in writing on forms prescribed by the Board. Each appeal or
application shall fully set forth the circumstances of the case. It shall
refer to the specific provision of this chapter that is involved and shall
exactly set forth, as the case may be, the interpretation that is claimed
on an allegation of error or the variance that is applied for and the
grounds on which it is claimed that the same should be granted. The
Clerk of the Board shall not receive nor shall the Board consider any
appeal or application that does not fully contain the information
required herein.
B. Any further proposal by the applicant or appellant with respect to either
any addition to or modification of the content of the proposal covered by
the application or appeal or any offer made in connection therewith
shall be made only in the form of an amended application or appeal. The
filing of any such amended application or appeal shall terminate all
proceedings on the original application or appeal and shall require the
holding of a new hearing, of which notice shall be given as in the first
instance.
C. Meetings, minutes, records. Meetings of the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall be open to the public to the extent provided in Article 7 of the New
York Public Officers Law. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall keep
minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon
every question or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and
shall also keep records of its examinations and other official actions.
D. Filing requirements. Every rule, regulation, every amendment or repeal
thereof, and every order, requirement, decision or determination of the
Zoning Board of Appeals shall be filed in the office of the Village Clerk
within five business days and shall be a public record, and a copy
thereof mailed to the applicant.
E. Hearing appeals. Unless otherwise provided by local law, the
jurisdiction of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be appellate only, and
shall be limited to hearing and deciding appeals from and reviewing any
order, requirement, decision, interpretation, or determination made by
the Code Enforcement Officer charged with the enforcement of this
chapter or any local law adopted pursuant to this chapter. The
concurring vote of a majority of the members of the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision
or determination of any such Code Enforcement Officer, or to grant a
§ 600-6.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-6.2
1:417
use variance or area variance. Such appeal may be taken by any person
aggrieved, or by an officer, department, board or bureau of the Village
other than the Board of Trustees.
F. Time of appeal. Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days after the
filing of any order, requirement, decision, interpretation or
determination of the Code Enforcement Officer charged with the
enforcement of such local law by filing with such Code Enforcement
Officer and with the Zoning Board of Appeals a notice of appeal,
specifying the grounds thereof and the relief sought. The Code
Enforcement Officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith
transmit to the Zoning Board of Appeals all the papers constituting the
record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
G. The applicant or appellant shall be required to provide notice of the
hearing upon a form approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals to all
record landowners within a two-hundred-foot radius of the property
which forms the subject of the appeal or application as said record
owners appear on the most current tax rolls of the Nassau County
Assessor's Office. Such notice shall be sent to the record landowners by
mail not less than 15 days and no more than 25 days before the public
hearing. Evidence of compliance with this subsection shall be provided
by the appellant or applicant prior to or at the public hearing. In
addition, the Secretary of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall publish
notice of the hearing not less than 10 days prior to the hearing date.
H. Stay upon appeal. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of
the action appealed from, unless the Code Enforcement Officer charged
with the enforcement of this chapter, from whom the appeal is taken,
certifies to the Zoning Board of Appeals, after the notice of appeal shall
have been filed with the Code Enforcement Officer, that by reason of
facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his or her opinion, cause
imminent peril to life or property, in which case proceedings shall not
be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by
the Zoning Board of Appeals or by a court of record on application, on
notice to the Code Enforcement Officer from whom the appeal is taken
and on good cause shown.
I. Time of decision. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall decide upon the
appeal within 62 days after the closing of said hearing. The time within
which the Zoning Board of Appeals must render its decision may be

rehearing to review any order, requirement, decision or determination
of the Board not previously reviewed may be made by any member of
the Board. A unanimous vote of all members of the Board then present
is required for such rehearing to occur. Such rehearing is subject to the
same notice provisions as an original hearing. Upon such rehearing, the
Board may reverse, modify or annul its original order, requirement,
decision, interpretation or determination upon the unanimous vote of
§ 600-6.2 MALVERNE CODE § 600-6.2

and appearance and conserve the property values of the Village; to
encourage good qualities of exterior building design and good
appearances and to relate such design and appearances to the site and
surrounding structures; to permit originality and resourcefulness in
building design and appearances which are appropriate to the sites and
surroundings; to prevent such design and appearances as are
unnecessarily offensive to visual sensibilities; to discourage and
prohibit structures which are visually offensive or inappropriate by
reason of poor qualities of exterior design, monotonous similarity or
striking visual discord in relation to their sites or surroundings, mar the
appearances of the surrounding area, impair the use, enjoyment and
desirability and reduce the values of properties, are detrimental to the
character of neighborhoods, prevent the most appropriate development
and utilization of land, and therefore adversely affect the functioning,
economic stability, prosperity, health, safety and general welfare of the
entire community.
B. It is also the purpose of this article to promote the health, safety and
general welfare of the Village through the process of site plan review,
reviewing the arrangement, layout, use, relationships and impacts of

which the permit was requested, if erected or altered in accordance
with this article, would not be visually offensive or inappropriate by

opportunity to confer upon suggestions for change of the plan, and
provided that the Board finds and states that the structure for which the
permit was requested would, if erected as indicated, provoke one or
more of the harmful effects set forth herein by reason of:
(1) Monotonous similarity to any other structure or structures located
or proposed to be located on the same street or corner thereof and

recreational purposes that may be used by the population of the
particular subdivision. Any fee required by the Planning Board in lieu of
land for park, playground or other recreation purposes or facilities

§ 600-13.7. Illegal occupancies.
Setback Map," is hereby adopted and made a part hereof, and the
lines, both of which are designated thereon as "Proposed New Property
Line," are hereby adopted as the front setback lines for that part of
Hempstead Avenue shown on said map.
B. Front yard setback. Subject to the provisions of Subsections C and D
hereof, the provisions of this chapter requiring a minimum front yard
shall not apply to any land abutting on that part of Hempstead Avenue
shown on the Hempstead Avenue Setback Map along the lines each
designated thereon as a proposed new property line.
C. Proposed new property line. Any other provision of this chapter to the
contrary notwithstanding, no building or structure hereafter erected on
any lot, piece or parcel of land abutting that part of Hempstead Avenue
shown on the Hempstead Avenue Setback Map along the lines
designated thereon as a proposed new property line shall be so
constructed that any part thereof shall extend into the area on said map
between said lines.
D. Setback determined. Any other provision of this chapter to the contrary
notwithstanding, each building or structure hereafter erected on any
lot, piece or parcel of land abutting that part of Hempstead Avenue
shown on the Hempstead Avenue Setback Map along the lines each
designated thereon as a proposed new property line shall be set back

structures for the purpose of applying the provision of Subsection D
hereof, and such buildings and structures, if relocated, remodeled or
reconstructed at any time after that date, shall conform to the
provisions of this section.
A. Legislative findings. The Incorporated Village of Malverne Board of
Trustees has found that there are instances in the Village of owners of
residential properties exploiting their buildings by creating illegal
occupancies which expose their residents therein to living in
substandard rooms or apartments. Such practices are in derogation of
the health, safety and welfare of members of the public, who are
entitled to such suitable and safe housing. Such illegal occupancies in
residential properties also have a detrimental effect on Village services
§ 600-13.6 MALVERNE CODE § 600-13.7
1:470
to the community. Accordingly, enforcement of applicable Village Code
provisions is a legitimate governmental obligation which requires
appropriate consideration.
B. Provisions relating to illegal occupancy prosecutions.
(1) It shall be unlawful to occupy or permit to be occupied or to assist
in the occupancy of a building or dwelling unit where the number of
occupants exceeds the permitted number of occupants. It shall be
unlawful to occupy any building or dwelling in violation of the
certificate of occupancy.
(2) Evidence of nonpermitted occupancy.
(a) In all civil and criminal prosecutions brought for enforcement
of provisions of the Village Code in respect to nonpermitted
occupancy of single- and two-family dwellings, the existence of
any of the conditions set forth below shall constitute evidence,
but not prima facie evidence, that a nonpermitted occupancy
exists at the premises. The existence of two or more of the
conditions set forth below shall constitute prima facie evidence
that a nonpermitted occupancy exists at the premises:
[1] Any dwelling which maintains more than one gas meter or
more than one electric meter or more than one water
meter is being used as the residence of two or more
families.
[2] Any dwelling which maintains more than two gas meters
or more than two electric meters or more than two water
meters is being used as the residence of three or more
families.
[3] A single-family dwelling which maintains any entrances
thereto, which entrance(s) has not been set forth on any
plans approved by and on file with the Village Building
Department, is being used as the residence of two or more
families.
[4] A two-family dwelling which maintains any third or
additional entrance thereto, which entrance(s) has not
been set forth on any plans approved by and on file with
the Village Building Department, is being used as the
residence of three or more families.
[5] A dwelling which has been advertised in any newspaper,
magazine or local advertising publication as being
available for sale or rent, which advertisement expressly
or implicitly provides that such dwelling contains rooms
for rent, more than one separate dwelling living unit, or
may be occupied by more than one separate family, is
being used as a dwelling containing the number of rooms
§ 600-13.7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-13.7
1:471
for rent, dwelling units or families stated or implied in
such advertisement.
[6] There exist two or more doorbells such as would indicate
two or more families are residing in the dwelling.
[7] There exists more than one mailbox or post office address
such as would indicate two or more families are residing in
the dwelling.
[8] There exist permanent partitions or internal doors which
may serve to bar access between segregated portions of
the dwelling, including but not limited to bedrooms, or the
inability of the occupant or person in possession thereof to
have unimpeded and/or lawful access to all parts of the
dwelling unit.
[9] There exist two or more kitchens, each containing one or
more of the following: a range, oven hot plate, microwave,
or other similar device customarily used for cooking or
preparation of foods and a refrigerator or sink.
(b) Nothing in this section shall be construed to lessen or modify
any other rights of the Village in the enforcement of the terms
of the Village Zoning Code.
(3) The presumption raised by proof of the existence of any such
conditions as set forth in Subsection B herein may be rebutted by
conclusive evidence that such conditions do not, in fact, exist or
that such conditions, in fact, comply with the Village Code.
(4) A person charged with a violation of the Village Code as described
herein may, if he or she so chooses, demand an inspection of the
subject premises by the Village Building Department to rebut such
presumption(s). Such demand shall be in writing addressed to the
Village Building Department. The Village Building Department
shall prepare a report of the finding of the inspection together with
photographs, if appropriate.
(5) Nothing in this section shall require presumptive evidence to
support a finding of an illegal occupancy, and any direct evidence of
an illegal occupancy shall be sufficient to support a finding of such
illegal occupancy.
C. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
FAMILY  A family consists of one or more persons, whether or not
related to each other by blood, marriage or adoption, all of whom
live and cohabit as a single, stable and bona fide housekeeping unit,
provided that such persons together occupy and own, lease or rent
the whole of the building or dwelling unit, in a family-like living
arrangement as the functional and factual equivalent of a natural family
§ 600-13.7 MALVERNE CODE § 600-13.7
1:472
and use all rooms and housekeeping facilities in common. Any such
number of persons shall not be deemed to constitute a family if any one
of such persons may not have lawful access to all parts of the principal
building or separate building or dwelling unit or if any one or more of
such persons lease or rent any portion of such principal building and/or
separate accessory building or dwelling unit from any other person.
SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING  A building designed for and occupied
exclusively as a home or residence for not more than one family,
containing a single kitchen in which members of a family all live and
cook together as a single housekeeping unit. Such a building shall not
contain separate or segregated internal partitions or locked internal
doors barring access between portions of the dwelling.
D. Penalties for offenses.
(1) A violation of a Code provision involving nonpermitted occupancy
of a single- or two-family dwelling is a violation, as that term is
defined in the New York State Penal Law.
(2) Notwithstanding any provision of this Code inconsistent herewith,
for each Code violation involving a nonpermitted occupancy of a
one- or two-family dwelling, or of an approved three-family
dwelling, the owner, occupant or any person who is in charge of the
subject property at the time of the violation shall be liable for a fine
of not less than $3,500 and not more than $5,000, or by
imprisonment for a period not to exceed 15 days, or both, following
a conviction for a first offense; and not less than $5,000, and no
more than $7,500, or by imprisonment for a period not to exceed 15
days, or both, for each additional offense.
(3) Each week that the violation continues to exist shall constitute a
separate and distinct violation.
E. Enforcement; severability.

Nassau.
(3) The Village Attorney may, upon direction of the Board of Trustees,
institute an action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of Nassau, for appropriate relief where it appears under the
circumstances that the imposition of a fine alone would not be
adequate.
(4) If any provision of this section shall be determined to be
unconstitutional or otherwise unenforceable, it shall not affect the
constitutionality or enforceability of the remaining provisions.

violation of this section shall constitute a separate offense.
A. Except for decorative retaining walls not exceeding 18 inches in height,
no retaining wall may be built within the Village unless the
Superintendent of Buildings issues a permit for its construction.
Application for a permit shall be made on a form promulgated by the
Superintendent of Buildings.
B. No permit shall be issued for a retaining wall unless:
(1) The application is accompanied by plans for the development of the
land that the retaining wall is intended to support and of any other
land on the same tax lot or lots; or
(2) The application demonstrates serious erosion or flooding problem,
or a serious threat to public health and safety, which the retaining
wall or walls is intended to eliminate; or
(3) The applicant provides any additional information requested by the
Superintendent of Buildings to evaluate the application.
C. In a residential zoning district, or within 50 feet of a residential zoning
district, no retaining wall may exceed five feet in height. In other
districts, no retaining wall may exceed eight feet in height. Height shall
§ 600-13.11 MALVERNE CODE § 600-13.13
1:478
§ 600-13.14. Satellite dish antennas.
be measured from the lowest point on the adjoining grade. This
subsection shall not prohibit applications for a series of retaining walls
in a parallel step design.
D. A minimum of five horizontal feet is required between retaining walls in
parallel step design. The area between such retaining walls must be
landscaped with natural material and must be maintained.
E. No retaining wall may exceed the height of the adjoining grade that it
supports or retains.
F. Provision must be made to accommodate stormwater on a property
during construction and after completion of a retaining wall.
G. The height restrictions of this section do not apply to retaining walls
whose construction was completed and which were backfilled prior to
the effective date of this chapter. If such walls are determined to be
unsafe by the Superintendent of Buildings or by a licensed engineer or
architect, they may be repaired, subject to approval by the
Superintendent of Buildings, provided that the repaired structure is of
the same, or smaller, size and type. If such walls are demolished or
abandoned, however, any replacement retaining wall must conform to
this section.
H. No retaining wall may be constructed in a front yard.
A. Purpose. The Board of Trustees hereby determines that in a community
such as the Village of Malverne, comprised principally of one-family
homes, the aesthetic impact of large parabolic or hemispheric discs or
other similar antennas or devices, measuring several feet in diameter,
can be offensive to the residential community and be inconsistent with
the character of the neighborhood. If unregulated, such devices can be
disruptive to the appearance of the skyline and disrupt the pleasant
nature and character of the community. Also, the interests of public
safety require that such devices be installed in accordance with welldefined
engineering standards, and other safety measures, such as
fencing around the base, may be necessary. These aesthetic and safety
concerns do not arise in connection with dipole antennas, which blend
into the skyline. The Board also finds that a regulatory scheme such as
is set forth herein allows a reasonable balancing of the needs of the
community and the rights of persons to reasonable access to television
or radio stations that they desire and to allow such antennas to fit into
the character of the community.
B. Permits; when required. No person shall cause, suffer or permit the
erection, construction, installation, relocation and/or maintenance of
any parabolic or hemispheric disc or satellite receive-only antenna or
other similar antenna or device, the purpose of which is to receive
television, radio and/or microwave or other electrical or similar signals
§ 600-13.13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-13.14
1:479
from satellites or from ground facilities which transmit such signals,
except as provided herein.
C. District permit required.
(1) In any commercial or industrial district, a satellite receive-only
antenna two meters or less in diameter is permitted without a
permit.
(2) In any district other than a commercial or industrial district, a
satellite receive-only antenna one meter or less in diameter is
permitted without a permit.
(3) In all other instances, no erection, construction, installation and/or
maintenance of any satellite dish antenna shall be permitted or
continued except when permitted by special use permit by the
Board of Trustees, after public hearing. The first permit granted to
any applicant under this section shall be conditional and shall be
for a period of not more than two years. Any application for renewal
of such conditional permit shall be acted upon in the same manner
as an initial application.
D. Requirements for special use permits.
(1) In evaluating whether a special use permit should be issued, the
Board of Trustees shall consider the purposes set forth in this
section.
(2) The antenna or other device shall be located only in the rear yard of
the lot unless the applicant establishes that other placement is
necessary to obtain reasonable reception.
(3) No permit shall be issued if the Board of Trustees finds that either
the type of antenna or disc, or the method of its placement, will
endanger the safety of residents, neighbors or pedestrians, or
threaten property on the applicant's lot or adjoining lots.
(4) Use of any illumination for the disc or antenna is strictly prohibited.
(5) All connections shall be made so that wiring and supporting cables
shall not be visible from the street or sidewalk.
(6) No more than one parabolic, hemispheric, satellite receive-only, or
similar antenna shall be erected, constructed, installed or
maintained on a single lot or premises.
(7) The Board of Trustees shall impose such screening requirements
that are reasonable to effectuate the purposes set forth in this
section and that will not substantially limit reception.
E. Application for permit. All applications for special use permits shall be
filed with the Board of Trustees. The application shall describe the
subject premises by street address, shall state the section, block and lot
§ 600-13.14 MALVERNE CODE § 600-13.14
1:480
§ 600-13.15. Solar energy systems.
number and shall describe the present use of the premises. In addition,
the application shall be accompanied by the following:
(1) A location survey showing existing structures upon the premises,
their location and distance from the proposed disc or antenna, the
dimensions of the parabolic disc or antenna; the setbacks of the
parabolic disc or antenna from each property line; and all
properties and structures within a two-hundred-foot radius of the
premises, showing the names and street addresses of the record
owner of each property.
(2) A detailed plan showing the material from which the parabolic disc
or antenna is to be constructed and the proposed color of the
parabolic disc or antenna and details illustrating the structural
support system.
(3) A landscape plan illustrating adequate screening of the parabolic
disc or antenna which will be provided to screen the parabolic disc
or antenna from the roadway and adjoining property owners.
Unless demonstrated to be impracticable, all screening required
shall be by coniferous trees and shall be of sufficient height and
density to screen 100% of the parabolic disc or antenna from sight
at ground level from the roadway and from properties located
within a two-hundred-foot radius of the premises during the entire
year.
(4) An application fee in an amount as set forth, from time to time, by
resolution of the Board of Trustees.
F. Notice required. Prior to the public hearing held by Board of Trustees,
the applicant shall file a certification of notice showing that all property
owners within 200 feet of the applicant's property were notified, in
writing, by the applicant of the application, by certified mail, return
receipt requested, at least 15 days and no more than 25 days before the
date scheduled for the public hearing. In addition, the Village Clerk
shall cause to be published notice of the hearing not less than 10 days
prior to the hearing date.180
A. Permit required. No solar energy system shall be erected or installed
unless an application has been submitted to, and approved by, the
Superintendent of Buildings.
B. Regulations. The Superintendent of Buildings shall issue a permit for
the erection or installation of a solar energy system, provided that the
application, and proposed erection or installation, complies with the
180. Editor's Note: Original § 49-13.15 of L.L. No. 5-2013, Sex offenders, which immediately

§ 600-13.16. Special exceptions for public utilities.
Any provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Board of Trustees
may, upon application and after a public hearing, permit any land to be used
and any building or other structure to be erected or used in any district
of the Village for the office, station or facilities of a public utility and for
the maintenance and operation of public utility machinery and equipment
if said Board shall find that such use is necessary for adequate public
utility service to any of the residents of the Village and that the proposed
location thereof is the most appropriate available location in the Village
therefor, considering the efficient operation of such utility, the use district
in which such property is located, the character of the neighborhood and
the possible effect of the maintenance of such use on the value of buildings
in the vicinity; and said Board may, if it grants such permit, impose such
reasonable conditions thereto as it shall deem necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes set forth in the Village Law, upon the considerations
set forth in said section.
§ 600-13.17. Telecommunications towers.
Long Island Unified Solar Permit Initiative and all other applicable
local, county, state and federal law.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide for the safe provision
of telecommunications consistent with applicable federal and state
regulations, and to protect the natural features and aesthetic character
of the Village.
B. Authority. The Village Trustees, upon application and after a public
hearing, and upon the recommendation of the Building Department,
may approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove special use
permits and site plans for the development of telecommunications
tower sites in the Village.
C. Applicability. This section applies to the use, erection, moving,
reconstruction, change or alteration of a structure within the Village to
serve as a telecommunications tower site. Where a provision of this
section conflicts with other provisions of this Code, the more restrictive
shall apply.
D. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE  A structure which serves the principal
use, is subordinate in area, extent and purpose to the principal use, and
is located on the same lot as the principal use.
ANTENNAS (AND/OR OTHER RECEIVING AND/OR TRANSMITTING
DEVICES)  Conductors that receive and/or transmit communications
signals.
§ 600-13.15 MALVERNE CODE § 600-13.17
1:482
SPECIAL USE  A use which is deemed allowable within a given zoning
district, but which is potentially incompatible with other uses and,
therefore, is subject to special standards and conditions set forth for
such use, subject to approval by the Building Department.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWER AND/OR SITE  A structure or
combination of structures of a height greater than 52 feet above grade,
which is capable of receiving and/or transmitting signals, and/or upon
which antennas and/or other receiving and/or transmitting devices are
located.
E. Special use regulations. No use, erection, moving, reconstruction,
change, or alteration of a telecommunications tower site is permitted
prior to the issuance of a special use permit and site plan approval in
conformity with this section.
F. Special use standards.
(1) Shared use of existing structures. At all times, shared use of
existing structures shall be preferred to the construction of new
telecommunications tower sites.
(2) Applicants for shared use (collocation). An applicant for shared use
of an existing structure shall be required to document intent from
the owner or lessee of the existing structure to share use. The
applicant shall ensure that all fees and costs of adapting the
existing structure to a new shared use are paid and that all
modifications required to adapt the existing structure to shared use
are performed in accordance with Building Department regulations
and in conformance with this section.
(3) Applicants for new construction. An applicant for new construction
of a telecommunications tower site shall be required to identify
existing structures within a one-mile radius of the proposed new
site which are capable of accommodating the applicant's
requirements to provide telecommunications service and shall
demonstrate good faith efforts to secure shared use from the
owners or lessees of the existing structures or that the proposed
telecommunications service cannot be installed or collocated on
the existing structures as an alternative to new construction.
(4) Future shared use of new telecommunications tower sites. Unless
demonstrated by the applicant to be unfeasible, the construction of
a new telecommunications tower site shall include capacity for
future shared use with other providers of telecommunications
services. An applicant for the construction of new
telecommunications tower sites shall document capacity for future
shared use of the proposed site.
(5) Setbacks. Telecommunications towers shall be set back from
abutting parcels, recorded rights-of-way, and street lines in
accordance with the setback requirements of the zoning district in
§ 600-13.17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-13.17
1:483
which the installation is to be located, or shall be located with a
minimum setback from any property line equal to 1 1/2 times the
height of the tower, whichever is greater. Setbacks shall apply to
all parts of the tower, including guy wire anchors, antennas and/or
other receiving and/or transmitting devices. Accessory structures
shall comply with the setback requirements of the zoning district in
which they are located.
(6) Visibility. All telecommunications towers and accessory structures
shall be sited to have the least practical adverse visual effect on the
environment. Telecommunications towers shall not be artificially
lighted except as required by the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA). Towers shall be a galvanized finish or painted gray above the
surrounding treeline unless other standards are required by the
FAA. In all cases, guyed towers shall be preferable to freestanding
towers. Towers should be designed and sited as to avoid, whenever
possible, application of FAA lighting and painting requirements.
Accessory structures shall maximize use of building materials,
colors and textures designed to blend with natural surroundings.
(7) Existing vegetation. Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved
to the maximum extent possible. No cutting of trees exceeding four
inches in diameter (measured at a height of four feet off the
ground) shall take place prior to the issuance of the special use
permit and plan site approval.
(8) Screening. The adequate planting of trees or shrubs is required to
screen the base of the telecommunications tower and accessory
structures from nearby property.
(9) Access. Adequate emergency and service access shall be provided.
Maximum use of existing roads, public or private, shall be made.
Road construction shall, at all times, minimize ground disturbance
and vegetation cutting to within the toe of fill, the top of cuts, or no
more than 10 feet beyond the edge of the pavement. Road grades
shall closely follow natural contours to assure minimal visual
disturbances and reduce soil erosion potential.
(10) Parking. Parking shall be provided to assure adequate emergency

accessory structures at the site. The notice of the discontinuance of
use shall be addressed to the Village Clerk, Malverne Village Hall,
99 Church Street, Malverne, New York 11565, and shall be sent by
certified mail, return receipt requested. Towers, antennas and/or
other receiving and/or transmitting devices, and/or accessory
structures shall be removed from the site within four months of
their discontinued use. Failure to have the structures removed
within four months following their discontinued use shall subject
the owner to a penalty of $100 per day for each day thereafter in
which the structure has not been removed, in addition to the actual
cost of any repair or clean-up of the site which the Village may be
required to undertake in order to ensure the public safety.
G. Security. The applicant, owner and/or lessee of the telecommunications
tower site shall be required to execute and file with the Village Clerk,
with a copy to the Village Attorney, a performance bond, or other
security, acceptable to the Village Attorney as to form and manner of
execution, in an amount sufficient for the faithful performance of the
terms and conditions of this section, the conditions of the permit or the
approval issued hereunder, for the observation of all Village laws and/or
ordinances, to cover the maintenance of the telecommunications tower
site during the period of its use, and/or to cover the cost of its removal
upon the discontinuance of its use. The amount required shall be
determined by the Board of Trustees upon the recommendation of the
Building Department. In the event of default in any of the provisions of
this section by the applicant, owner, and/or lessee of the
telecommunications tower site, the performance bond, or other
security, shall be forfeited to the Village, which shall be entitled to
maintain an action thereon. The performance bond, or other security,
shall remain in full force and effect until the removal of the
telecommunications tower and all accessory structures thereto
pursuant to this section. The owner and/or lessee of the
telecommunications tower site shall certify annually, in writing, to the
Village Clerk, with a copy to the Village Attorney, that the performance
bond, or other security, is in full force and effect.
H. General public liability insurance. Upon issuance of the special permit
and site plan approval, the applicant, owner and/or lessee of the
telecommunications tower site shall obtain a policy of general public
liability insurance in an amount (per occurrence) to be determined by
the Village Board of Trustees, from a company licensed as an insurer in
the State of New York, naming the Village as an additional insured
§ 600-13.17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-13.17
1:485
under the policy. Such insurance coverage shall be maintained until
such time as the telecommunications tower has been removed pursuant
to this section.
I. General indemnification. In addition to and distinct from the insurance
and security requirements of this section, the applicant, owner and/or
lessee of the telecommunications tower site shall be required to defend,
indemnify and hold the Village, its elected and appointed officials, its
agents and/or employees harmless from and against all damages, losses
and expenses arising out of or resulting from, or alleged to arise out of
or result from, the acts, omissions, failure to act or misconduct of the
applicant, owner, and/or lessee of the telecommunications tower site, or
its/their affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or
subcontractors, in the construction, operation, maintenance, or repair
or removal of the telecommunications tower or any accessory
structures thereto and/or in providing or offering services through such
telecommunications tower or any accessory structures thereto and/or
in providing or offering services through such telecommunications
facility, whether such acts or omissions are authorized or prohibited by
this section or by lease or other agreement entered into pursuant to this
section.
J. Authority to impose other conditions. The Board of Trustees shall have
the authority to impose such other reasonable conditions and
restrictions as are directly related and incidental to the proposed
telecommunications tower special use or site plan.
K. Special use permits and site plan approval. Applications for special use
permits and site plan approval to develop telecommunications tower
sites shall be made in writing in accordance with instructions provided
by the Building Department.
L. Notice. At least 30 days prior to the public hearing on the application
for the proposed development of the telecommunications tower site, the
applicant shall send notice of the time, date, location and purpose of the
hearing, by United States mail or equivalent means, individually to the
property owners on the tax rolls of the Village (or on an official registry
of a locality adjacent to the Village) whose property is located within
500 feet of the proposed or existing tower site, and shall cause such
notice to be published once a week for four consecutive weeks in a
newspaper of general circulation and in the official newspaper
designated by the Village.

Trustees to approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove special
use permits and site plans for the development of telecommunications

of which were committed within a period of five years, punishable by a fine
not less than $700 nor more than $1,000 or imprisonment for a period not
to exceed 15 days, or both. However, for the purpose of this chapter or of
such local law or regulation, violations shall be deemed misdemeanors and
for such purpose only all provisions of law relating to misdemeanors shall
apply to such violations. Each week's continued violation shall constitute a
separate additional violation.

issue, grant or approve any permit, license, certificate or other
authorization for any erection, demolition or relocation of any building
or structure or for any use of any land or building that is not in full
compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Any such permit,
license, certificate or other authorization issued, granted or approved
in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter shall be null and void
and of no effect without the necessity of any proceedings for revocation
or nullification thereof and any work undertaken or use established

be unlawful and no action shall be taken by any officer, board, agency or
employee of the Village, including the Zoning Board of Appeals,

§ 600-14.0 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-14.2
1:489
§ 600-14.2. Remedies.
In case any building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed,
altered, repaired, converted or maintained or any building, structure or
land is used in violation of this chapter or of any ordinance or other
regulation made under authority conferred thereby, the proper local
authorities of the Village, in addition to other remedies, may institute
any appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such unlawful erection,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance or
use; to restrain, correct or abate such violation; to prevent the occupancy
of said building, structure or land; or to prevent any illegal act, conduct,
business or use in or about such premises.
§ 600-14.3. Interpretation.
Whenever any provision of this chapter is in conflict with any other
provision of this chapter or any other statute or local law applicable or
covering the same subject matter, the most restrictive provision or the one
imposing the highest standard shall govern and be supreme.
§ 600-14.4. Amendments.
The Board of Trustees may from time to time, upon its own initiative or on
petition, amend, supplement, change, modify, or repeal this chapter or any
portion thereof, including, but not limited to, the Zoning Map and Schedule
of Regulations, in accordance with the Village Law of the State of New York.
§ 600-14.5. Severability.
If any article, section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision, clause, phrase or
provision of this chapter shall be judged invalid or held unconstitutional,
the same shall not affect the validity of this chapter as a whole or any
part or provision thereof, other than the part so decided to be invalid or
