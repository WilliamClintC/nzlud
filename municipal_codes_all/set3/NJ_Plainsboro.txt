testimony until March 22, 1999.
D. Representation of indigent defendants.
(1) The Municipal Public Defender shall represent an indigent
defendant charged in Municipal Court with a crime as specified in
N.J.S.A. 2B:12-18 or, if in the opinion of the Municipal Court, there
is a likelihood that the defendant, if convicted of any other offense,
will be subject to imprisonment or other consequence of
magnitude, the Municipal Public Defender shall represent an
indigent defendant.
(2) If there is a vacancy in the office of Municipal Public Defender, if
the Municipal Public Defender is temporarily unavailable or if a
finding of conflict of interest precludes the Municipal Public
Defender from representing an indigent defendant, the Municipal
Prosecutor may prosecute the offense if the Municipal Court
appoints a qualified attorney to represent the indigent defendant.
Unless rates are otherwise established by the municipality the
attorney shall be entitled to compensation at the same rate as
attorneys hired by the Office of the Public Defender in conflict
cases, with payment to be made within 30 days. Once appointed,
the attorney shall carry out all duties of the Municipal Public
Defender in connection with the case that is the subject of the
appointment.
E. Eligibility for services.
(1) Eligibility for services of the Municipal Public Defender shall be
determined by the Municipal Court on the basis of the need of the
defendant. Need shall be measured according to Section 14 of P.L.
1967, c.43 (N.J.S.A. 2A:158A-14) and guidelines promulgated by the
New Jersey Supreme Court.
(2) In the event that a determination of eligibility cannot be made
before the time when the first services are to be rendered, or if an
initial determination is found to be erroneous, the Municipal Court
shall refer the defendant to the Municipal Public Defender
provisionally, and if subsequently it is determined that the
defendant is ineligible, the Municipal Court shall inform the
defendant, and the defendant shall be obliged to engage his own
counsel and to reimburse for the cost of the services rendered to
that time.
(3) The Municipal Court shall make an investigation of the financial
status of each defendant seeking representation pursuant to this
act and shall have the authority to require a defendant to execute
§ 2-16.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 2-16.1
1:21
and deliver written requests or authorizations required under
applicable law to provide the Court with access to records of public
or private sources, otherwise confidential, as may be of aid in
evaluating eligibility. The Court is authorized to obtain information
from any public record office of the state or of any subdivision
or agency thereof on request and without payment of the fees
ordinarily required by law.
(4) Whenever a person entitled to representation by a Municipal Public
Defender pursuant to this act is under the age of 18 years, the
eligibility for services shall be determined on the basis of financial
circumstance of the individual and the financial circumstances of
the individual's parents or legal guardians. The municipality shall
be entitled to recover the cost of legal services from the parent or
legal guardians as provided in this section, in Section 16 of the Act,
and the Municipal Court shall have authority to require parents or
legal guardians to execute and deliver the written requests or
authorization required under applicable law in order to provide the
Court with access to records of public or private sources, otherwise
confidential, as may be of aid to it in evaluating eligibility.
(5) If the defendant has or reasonably expects to have means to meet
some part, though not all, of the cost of the services rendered, the
defendant shall be required to reimburse the municipality, either by
a single payment or in installments in such amounts as he can
reasonably be expected to pay; but no default or failure in making
payment shall affect or reduce the rendering of services.
(6) A municipality shall have a lien on any property to which the
defendant shall have or acquire an interest for an amount equal to
the reasonable value of the services rendered to a defendant
pursuant to this act as calculated at the same rate as the Office of
the Public Defender bills clients at that time.
(7) To effectuate such a lien for the municipality, the municipal
attorney shall file a notice setting other services rendered to the
defendant and the reasonable value thereof with the Clerk of the
superior Court. The filing of the notice with the Clerk of the
superior Court shall constitute a lien on property for a period of 10
years from the date of filing, unless discharged sooner, and, except
for such time limitations, shall have the force and effect of a
judgment. Within 10 days of the filing of the notice, the Municipal
Attorney shall send, by certified mail, or serve personally, a copy of
the notice with a statement of the date of the filing to or upon the
defendant at the defendant's last known address. If the Municipal
Attorney shall fail to give notice, the lien is void.
F. A municipality shall require by ordinance person applying for
representation by a Municipal Public Defender or court-approved
counsel to pay an application fee of not more than $200, but only in an
amount necessary to pay the costs of Municipal Public Defender
§ 2-16.1 PLAINSBORO CODE § 2-16.1

services. In accordance with guidelines promulgated by the Supreme
Court, the Municipal Court may waive any required application fee, in
whole or in part, only if the Court determines, in its discretion, upon
a clear and convincing showing by the applicant, that the application
fee represents an unreasonable burden on the person seeking
representation. The Municipal Court may permit a person to pay the
application fee over a specific period of time not to exceed four months.

on behalf of the Chief Financial Officer, shall provide the
applicant with a notice of insufficient escrow balance. In
order for work to continue on the application or

upon by the Township and the applicant. Such amount
shall be sufficient to pay all unpaid bills as well as an

action on the application because the applicant has not
posted the additional escrow deposit provided for in this
subsection. Whether or not specifically stated in the
resolution of memorialization, payment in a timely manner
of all escrow fees which become due shall be a condition
of the approval on any application.
[2] The Director of Planning and Zoning may issue a stop-work
order if payment of required escrow funds is not provided
within 10 business days. Such stop-work order shall result
in the ceasing of all activities relative to that application.
(d) Periodic accounting for escrow funds and expenditures. The
Chief Financial Officer or the Township's escrow account bank
shall prepare and send to the applicant a statement which shall
include an accounting of funds listing all deposits, interest
earnings, if applicable, disbursements and the cumulative
balance of the escrow account. This information shall be
provided on a quarterly basis, if monthly charges are $1,000 or
less, or on a monthly basis if monthly charges exceed $1,000.
(e) The applicant shall send written notice, by certified mail, to the
Chief Financial Officer, to the Board of jurisdiction and to
municipal professionals who worked on the application review
that the Board of jurisdiction has granted final approval; that,
in the case of subdivision or site plan, the subdivision or site
plan has been signed by the Board of jurisdiction, and the
approval has otherwise been perfected; and that, in the case of
all other applications for which escrow deposits are necessary,
the approval has been perfected, and no further work by
municipal professionals is necessary. After receipt of said
notice, each professional shall render a final bill to the Chief
Financial Officer within 30 days. The Chief Financial Officer
shall render a written final accounting to the applicant on the
uses to which the deposit was put within 45 days of receipt of
the final bill from the professionals. Any balances remaining in
the escrow account, including interest, if applicable, shall be
refunded to the applicant along with the final accounting. The
refunding process shall be in accordance with the guidelines
and procedures established by the division of local government
services in effect at that time.

(1) The municipality may file a court action pursuant to N.J.S.A.
2A:58-11 alleging a violation or violations of the regulations
governing the affordable housing unit. If the owner, developer or
tenant is adjudged by the court to have violated any provision of the
regulations governing affordable housing units the owner,
developer or tenant shall be subject to one or more of the following
penalties, at the discretion of the court:
(a) A fine of not more than $500 per day or imprisonment for a
period not to exceed 90 days, or both, provided that each and
every day that the violation continues or exists shall be
considered a separate and specific violation of these provisions
and not a continuation of the initial offense;
(b) In the case of an owner who has rented a low- or moderateincome
unit in violation of the regulations governing affordable
housing units, payment into the Township of Plainsboro
Affordable Housing Trust Fund of the gross amount of rent
illegally collected;
(c) In the case of an owner who has rented a low- or moderateincome
unit in violation of the regulations governing affordable
§ 3-22 PLAINSBORO CODE § 3-23
1:54
housing units, payment of an innocent tenant's reasonable
relocation costs, as determined by the court.
(2) The municipality may file a court action in the Superior Court
seeking a judgment that would result in the termination of the
owner's equity or other interest in the unit, in the nature of a
mortgage foreclosure. Any such judgment shall be enforceable as if
the same were a judgment of default of the first purchase money
mortgage and shall constitute a lien against the low- or moderateincome
unit.
(a) The judgment shall be enforceable, at the option of the
municipality, by means of an execution sale by the Sheriff, at
which time the low- and moderate-income unit of the violating
owner shall be sold at a sale price which is not less than the
amount necessary to fully satisfy and pay off any first purchase
money mortgage and prior liens and the costs of the
enforcement proceedings incurred by the municipality,
including attorney's fees. The violating owner shall have his
right to possession terminated as well as his title conveyed
pursuant to the Sheriff's sale.
(b) The proceeds of the Sheriff's sale shall first be applied to
satisfy the first purchase money mortgage lien and any prior
liens upon the low- and moderate-income unit. The excess, if
any, shall be applied to reimburse the municipality for any and
all costs and expenses incurred in connection with either the
court action resulting in the judgment of violation or the
Sheriff's sale. In the event that the proceeds from the Sheriff's
sale are insufficient to reimburse the municipality in full as
aforesaid, the violating owner shall be personally responsible
for the full extent of such deficiency, in addition to any and all
costs incurred by the municipality in connection with collecting
such deficiency. In the event that a surplus remains after
satisfying all of the above, such surplus, if any, shall be placed
in escrow by the municipality for the owner and shall be held in
such escrow for a maximum period of two years or until such
earlier time as the owner shall make a claim with the
municipality for such. Failure of the owner to claim such
balance within the two-year period shall automatically result in
a forfeiture of such balance to the municipality. Any interest
accrued or earned on such balance while being held in escrow
shall belong to and shall be paid to the municipality, whether
such balance shall be paid to the owner or forfeited to the
municipality.
(c) Foreclosure by the municipality due to violation of the
regulations governing affordable housing units shall not
extinguish the restrictions of the regulations governing
affordable housing units as the same apply to the low- and
moderate-income unit. Title shall be conveyed to the purchaser

§ 3-24. Appeals.
Appeals from all decisions of an administrative agent appointed pursuant to
this chapter shall be filed in writing with the court.
Chapter 4
ASSESSOR
§ 4-1. Office designated appointive.
The Tax Assessor shall be appointed by the Mayor, with the advice and
consent of the Township Committee. The Tax Assessor shall assess real and
personal property for taxation within the municipality in accordance with
at the Sheriff's sale, subject to the restrictions and provisions
of the regulations governing the affordable housing unit. The
owner determined to be in violation of the provisions of this
plan and from whom title and possession were taken by means
of the Sheriff's sale shall not be entitled to any right of
redemption.
(d) If there are no bidders at the Sheriff's sale, or if insufficient
amounts are bid to satisfy the first purchase money mortgage
and any prior liens, the municipality may acquire title to the
low- and moderate-income unit by satisfying the first purchase
money mortgage and any prior liens and crediting the violating
owner with an amount equal to the difference between the first
purchase money mortgage and any prior liens and costs of the
enforcement proceedings, including legal fees and the
maximum resale price for which the low- and moderate-income
unit could have been sold under the terms of the regulations
governing affordable housing units. This excess shall be
treated in the same manner as the excess which would have
been realized from an actual sale as previously described.
(e) Failure of the low- and moderate-income unit to be either sold
at the Sheriff's sale or acquired by the municipality shall
obligate the owner to accept an offer to purchase from any
qualified purchaser which may be referred to the owner by the
municipality, with such offer to purchase being equal to the
maximum resale price of the low- and moderate-income unit as
permitted by the regulations governing affordable housing
units.
(f) The owner shall remain fully obligated, responsible and liable
for complying with the terms and restrictions of governing
affordable housing units until such time as title is conveyed
from the owner.

such office for a term of four years computed from the first day of July
next following his appointment. In the event the Tax Assessor appointed is
unable for whatever reason to complete his term of office, an interim Tax
Assessor shall be appointed by the Mayor, with the advice and consent of
the Township Committee, to serve out the remainder of said term.

appointed by the governing body. The members of the heretoforecreated
Zoning Board of Adjustment are hereby reappointed to serve
their respective terms. The terms of all new members appointed under
this chapter shall be so determined that to the greatest practicable
extent the expiration of such terms shall be distributed, in the case of

initial term of no alternate member shall exceed two years. Thereafter,
the term of each regular member shall be four years, and the term of
each alternate member shall be two years.

alternate member is to vote, Alternate No. 1 shall vote.
C. No member of the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall hold an elective
office or position under the municipality.
D. Any vacancy on said Board occurring other than by expiration of term
shall be filled by appointment by the governing body of the municipality

become vacant. A member may be removed by the governing body for
cause, but only after public hearing and other requested procedural

among its regular members a Chairman and a Vice Chairman. The
Board shall also select a Secretary who may or may not be a member of

of a specific piece of property, or by reason of exceptional
topographic conditions or physical features uniquely affecting a
specific piece of property, or by reason of an extraordinary and
exceptional situation uniquely affecting a specific piece of property
or the structures lawfully existing thereon, the strict application of
any zoning regulation would result in peculiar and exceptional
practical difficulties to, or exceptional and undue hardship upon,
the developer of such property, grant, upon an application or an
appeal relating to such property, a variance from such strict
application of such regulation so as to relieve such difficulties or
hardship; or wherein an application or appeal relating to a specific
piece of property, the purposes of this chapter set forth in section

conjunction with which the Planning Board has power to review a
request for a variance pursuant to § 20-7G.

elect to submit a subsequent application for any required approval of a
subdivision, site plan or conditional use. The separate approval of the
variance shall be conditioned upon the grant of all required subsequent

substantial impairment of the intent and purpose of the zone plan and
Zoning Ordinance. [Added 9-24-1984 by Ord. No. 0-84-1439]

B. Failure of the Board to render a decision within such one-hundredtwenty-
day period or within such further time as may be consented to
by the applicant shall constitute a decision favorable to the applicant.

ALARM SYSTEMS
GENERAL REFERENCES
Department of Public Safety  See Ch. 14.
Public Safety Director  See Ch. 28.
Fire prevention  See Ch. 64.
§ 47-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide minimum standards and
regulations for the use of privately installed burglary, robbery, medical and
fire alarm systems, to require registration, to establish fees and fines and to
create an administrative apparatus.
§ 47-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ALARM SYSTEM  An assembly of equipment and devices arranged to
signal a monitoring company of the presence of a hazard or medical
emergency requiring urgent attention and to which police, fire fighters and/
or emergency medical personnel are expected to respond. "Alarm system"
does not include an alarm installed in a vehicle or on someone's person
unless the vehicle or the personal alarm is permanently located at a site. In
this chapter, the term "alarm system" shall include but not be limited to:
AUTOMATIC HOLDUP ALARM SYSTEM  An alarm system in which a
signal transmission is initiated by the action of a robber.
A.
BURGLAR ALARM SYSTEM  An alarm system signaling an entry or
attempted entry into the area protected by the system.
B.
HOLDUP ALARM SYSTEM  An alarm system signaling a robbery or
attempted robbery generated by the manual activation of a device.
C.
DURESS ALARM SYSTEM  A silent alarm signal generated by the
entry of a designated code into an arming station in order to signal that
the alarm user is being forced to turn off the system and requires law
enforcement response.
D.
§ 38-2 PLAINSBORO CODE § 47-2
43:128
CANCELLATION  The process where response to a burglar alarm is
terminated when a monitoring company (designated by the alarm user) for
the alarm site notifies our Communications Center there is not an existing
situation at the alarm site requiring law enforcement response after an
alarm dispatch request.
FALSE ALARM  An alarm signal, eliciting a response by police, fire
fighters, and/or emergency medical personnel when a situation requiring a
response by the police, fire fighters, and/or emergency medical personnel
does not in fact exist, but does not include an alarm signal caused by violent
conditions of nature or other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably
subject to control by the alarm user.
MONITORING  The process by which a monitoring company receives
signals for an alarm system and relays an alarm dispatch request to the
municipality for the purpose of summoning police, fire, and/or emergency
medical services.
MONITORING COMPANY  The person in the business of providing
monitoring services.
VERIFY  An attempt by the monitoring company or its representative to
contact the alarm site and/or the alarm user by telephone and/or other
electronic means, whether or not actual contact with a person is made,
to determine whether a burglar alarm signal is valid before requesting
law enforcement dispatch, in an attempt to avoid an unnecessary alarm
dispatch request. For the purpose of this chapter, telephone verification
shall require, at a minimum, that a second call be made to a different
number if the first attempt fails to reach an alarm user who can properly
identify themselves to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before
requesting law enforcement dispatch.
§ 47-3. Registration of alarm system.
FIRE ALARM SYSTEMS  Alarm systems which monitor temperature,
humidity, or any other condition of a fire hazard nature, and not directly
related to the detection of an unauthorized intrusion into a premises or

contrary in this chapter, the term "alarm system" shall not include selfcontained
battery or electrically powered smoke detector units located
within a dwelling unit which give out an audible signal and which are
not tied into or directly connected with a central receiving station.
E.

medical assistance.
F.
A. An initial registration shall be required for each alarm system within
the Township of Plainsboro.

ARTICLE I
Affordable Housing Development Fees
§ 57-1. Findings and purposes.
§ 57-2. Definitions.
As used herein the following terms shall have the following definitions:
§ 57-3. Development fee schedule.
A. The New Jersey Supreme Court, in Holmdel Builders v. Holmdel,
Township, 121 N.J. 550 (1990), determined that mandatory
development fees are both statutorily and constitutionally permissible.
The Court further anticipated that the Council would promulgate
appropriate development fee rules specifying, among other things, the
standards for these development fees. The purpose of this section is to
provide such rules pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:92-18 et seq.
B. The Township Committee finds and declares that the creation and
preservation of affordable housing in the township serves the public
interest. Maintaining and improving a stock of sound affordable
housing requires affirmative steps by local government working
cooperatively with public bodies at all levels and with the private sector.
The purpose of this section is to create in the Township of Plainsboro a
trust fund from payment of development fees to assist in the marshaling
of public and private moneys dedicated to affordable housing projects
and programs.
A. "Affordable housing" means any housing unit with an acquisition price
or rent level not exceeding the maximum resale or rent level for low and
moderate income housing as set forth in N.J.A.C. 5:92-1.2.
B. "Council" means the New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing
established under the Fair Housing Act of 1985, and which has primary
jurisdiction for the administration of low and moderate housing
delegations in accordance with sound regional planning considerations
in this state.
C. "Development fees" mean money paid by an individual, person,
partnership, association, company, or corporation for the improvement
of property as permitted in N.J.A.C. 5:92-18 et seq.
D. "Equalized assessed value" means the value of a property determined
by the municipal tax assessor through a process designed to ensure that
all property in the municipality is assessed at the same assessment ratio
and ratios required by law. Estimates at the time of building permit may
be obtained by the tax assessor utilizing estimates for construction
cost. Final equalized assessed value will be determined at project
completion by the municipal tax assessor.
A. Residential development.
§ 57-1 MECHANICAL CODE § 57-3
55A:169
§ 57-4. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions, an exemptions.
(1) The Township will not collect residential development fees except
as provided in Subsection A(2).
(2) The Township may allow developers of sites zoned for inclusionary
development to pay a fee in lieu of building low and moderate
income units provided the Council determines the Township's
housing element and fair share plan provides a realistic
opportunity for addressing the Township's fair share obligation.
The fee may equal the cost of subsidizing the low and moderate
income units that are replaced by the development fee. For
example, an inclusionary development may include a 20% setaside,
no set aside, and a fee that is the equivalent of a 20% setaside
or a combination of a fee and set-aside that is the equivalent
of a 20% set-aside. All such arrangements must first be approved
by the Council on Affordable Housing.
(3) The Township may collect fees exceeding those permitted in this
section provided the Township enters into agreements with
developers that offer a financial incentive for paying higher fees.
The financial incentive may be in the form of a tax abatement. No
agreement may provide for a voluntary development fee without
also providing for a comparable off-setting incentive. All
agreements are subject to a Council approval.
B. Nonresidential development.
(1) Nonresidential development fees shall be a maximum of 2% of the
equalized assessed value for nonresidential development. The
following zoning districts are subject to the nonresidential
development fees: General Business GB, Neighborhood Business
Zone NB, OB-1 Office Business Zone, I-100 Limited Industrial Zone,
S-R Service-Residential Zone, PCD Planned Unit Development
Zone, PMUD Planned Unit Development, and Village Center Zone
VC. [Amended 10-13-2004 by Ord. No. 0-04-19; 2-9-2005 by
Ord. No. 0-05-02; 12-27-2007 by Ord. No. 0-07-26]
(2) The Township may collect fees exceeding those permitted in this
section provided they enter into agreements with developers that
offer a financial incentive for paying higher fees. Such agreements
may include, but are not limited to, a tax abatement, increased
commercial/industrial square footage, increased commercial/
industrial lot coverage and/or increased commercial/industrial
impervious coverage in return for an increased development fee.
The development fee negotiated must, bear a reasonable
relationship to the additional commercial-industrial consideration
to be received. All agreements are subject to approval by the
Council.
§ 57-3 PLAINSBORO CODE § 57-4
55A:170
§ 57-5. Collection of development fees.
The township shall collect 50% of the fee on any specific development prior
to and as a condition of the issuance of the building permit therefor. The
remaining portion shall be collected prior to and as a condition of the
issuance of the certificate of occupancy. After an issuance of a building
permit, the construction official shall refer the plans for the development to
the Tax Assessor. The Tax Assessor shall certify to the construction official
the final equalized assessed value in advance of the issuance of a certificate
of occupancy by the construction official. The remaining portion of the
development fee shall be adjusted to reflect any change in the estimated
equalized assessed value so that the total of the two payments shall equal
100% of the total development fee based upon the final equalized assessed
value.
§ 57-6. Housing Fund and use of money.
A. Except as provided for in § 57-3 above, inclusionary developments shall
be exempt from development fees.
B. Development fees shall be collected when an existing structure is
expanded or undergoes a more intense use. The development fee that
may be collected shall be calculated on the increase in the equalized
value of the improved structure.
C. The township shall not reduce densities from preexisting levels and
then require developers to pay development fees in exchange for an
increased density.
D. Developments that have received preliminary or final approval prior to
the imposition of a development fee shall be exempt from development
fees unless the developer seeks a substantial change in the approval.
E. The township exempts the following types of development from the
imposition of development fees:
(1) Development by the township or any of its instrumentalities; and
(2) Development by charitable or not-for-profit entities formed and
legally established in accordance with the laws of the State of New
Jersey.
A. All development fees shall be deposited with the Chief Financial Officer
of the township in a separate designated interest-bearing housing trust
fund. The development fees placed in the housing trust fund shall be
deemed "dedicated revenues" as such term is defined in N.J.S.A.
40A:4-36. In establishing the housing trust fund, the township shall
provide whatever express written authorization that may be required
by the bank utilized by the township in order to permit the Council to
direct the disbursement of development fees pursuant to § 57-8 of this
article.
§ 57-4 MECHANICAL CODE § 57-6
55A:171
§ 57-7. Spending plans.

share obligation. Such activities include, but are not limited to,
rehabilitation, new construction, regional contribution agreements,
purchase of land for low and moderate income housing, improvement of
land to be used for low and moderate income housing, extension and/or
improvements of roads and infrastructure to low and moderate income
housing sites, assistance designed to render units to be more affordable
and administration of the implementation of the housing element.
C. Funds shall not be expended to reimburse the township for past
housing activities.
D. At least 30% of the revenues collected from development fees shall be
devoted to render units more affordable. Examples of such activities
include, but are not limited to, down payment assistance, low interest
loans, and rental assistance. This requirement may be waived in whole
or in part when the township demonstrates to the Council the ability to
address the requirement of affordability assistance from another
source.
E. No more than 20% of the revenues collected from development fees
shall be expended on administration, but not limited to, salaries and
benefits for township employees or consultant fees necessary to
develop or implement a rehabilitation program, a new construction
program, a regional contribution agreement, a housing element, and an
affirmative marketing program. Administrative funds may be used for
income qualification of households, monitoring the turnover of sale and
rental units, and compliance with the Council's monitoring
requirements.
A. The township shall submit to the Council a spending plan for the
development fees collected by it prior to the expiration of its
substantive certification period. Plans to spend development fees shall
consist of the following information:
(1) A projection of revenues anticipated from imposing fees on
development, based on historic activity;
(2) A description of the administrative mechanism that the township
will use to collect and distribute revenues;

direct the manner in which all development fees collected pursuant to
this article shall be expended. Should any such condition occur, such
revenues shall immediately become available for expenditure at the
direction of the Council upon the Township Clerk's receipt of written
notification from the Council that such a condition has occurred. In
furtherance of the foregoing, the township shall, in establishing a bank
account pursuant to § 57-6 of this article, ensure that the township has
provided whatever express written authorization which may be
required by the bank to permit the Council to direct disbursement of
such revenues from the account following the delivery to the bank of
the aforementioned written notification provided by the Council to the
Township Clerk.
B. Occurrence of the following may result in the Council taking an action
pursuant to Subsection A above:
(1) Failure to submit a spending plan pursuant to § 57-7 above within
the time limits imposed by the Council;
(2) Failure to meet deadlines for information required by the Council in

and equipment, aerial and ground seeding and spraying, large tractors
and numerous farm laborers and the application of chemical fertilizers and
products for either the control and elimination of insects, pests, weeds,
fungus and other substances injurious to the farming process or for the

Authorization and Purpose
§ 66-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the. State of New Jersey has, in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et
seq. and N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq., delegated the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public

Committee of the Township of Plainsboro, County of Middlesex, State of
New Jersey, does ordain as follows:
§ 66-2. Findings.
§ 66-3. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. The flood hazard areas of the Township of Plainsboro are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and
velocities and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other
areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
§ 66-1 (RESERVED) § 66-3
64:187
§ 66-4. Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this article includes methods and
provisions for:
H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
floodwaters;
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
B. As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
APPEAL  A request for a review of the Township Engineer's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a
variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO Zone on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one
foot to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of
flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be
evident.
AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  The land in the floodplain
within a community subject to a one-percent-or-greater chance of
flooding in any given year.
BASE FLOOD  The flood having a one-percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
BREAKAWAY WALL  A wall that is not part of the structural support
of the building and is intended, through its design and construction, to
collapse under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage
to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system.
DEVELOPMENT  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved
real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures,
mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling
operations located within the area of special flood hazard.
DIGITAL FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (DFIRM)  The official map
on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the
areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to
the community.
ELEVATED BUILDING  A nonbasement building which is built, in the
case of a building in an area of special flood hazard, to have the top
of the elevated floor or, in the case of a building in a coastal highhazard
area, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural
member of the elevated floor, elevated above the ground level by means
of piling, columns (posts and piers) or sheer walls parallel to the flow
of the water and which is adequately anchored so as not to impair the
§ 66-5 (RESERVED) § 66-5

structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude
of the base flood. In an area of special flood hazard, "elevated building"
also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation
perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movement of floodwaters. In areas of coastal high hazard, "elevated
building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of
"elevated building," even though the lower area is enclosed by means
of breakaway walls.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM)  The official map on which
the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas

B. Conditions for variances. [Amended 6-9-2010 by Ord. No. 0-10-13]
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that
items in Subsection A(4)(a) through (k) have been fully considered.
As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as an historic structure and the variance is the
minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design
of the structure.
(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public as identified in Subsection A(4) or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in § 66-7 are areas
designated as floodways. Since the floodway is a an extremely hazardous
area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential
projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
(2) All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved
within an area of special flood hazard shall be elevated on a
permanent foundation such that the top of the lowest floor is at or
above the base flood elevation.
A. Encroachments shall be prohibited, including fill, new construction,

member of the Township Committee, it shall be acted upon no later than

§ 85-20. Streets. [Amended 5-1-1979 by Ord. No. 0-79-8; 6-8-1981
by Ord. No. 0-81-12]
Proposed streets and extensions of existing streets shall conform to Master
Plan and Official Map recommendations. Those not shown shall be designed
and located to facilitate orderly circulation patterns, assure emergency
access and provide for future connections to adjoining properties. In
passing on the adequacy of development plans, the Planning Board shall
apply the standards contained in this section.
A. The applicant shall comply with the following requirements and
principles of land subdivision in the design of each subdivision or
portion thereof. Prior to the granting of final approval, the applicant
shall have installed or shall have furnished performance guaranties in
accordance with § 85-53 for the ultimate installation or protection of
the items required by this article.
B. The subdivision shall conform to design standards that will encourage
good development patterns encouraging a coordinated, well-planned
community with provisions for desirable services and circulation
facilities. The subdivision shall conform to the proposals and conditions
shown on the Master Plan and Official Map, as adopted by the
Township.
A. The arrangements of arterial and collector streets shall be such as to
provide for the extension of existing arterials and collectors. Minor
streets shall not be made continuous or be so aligned that one
subdivision adds to the traffic generated by a minor street in another
subdivision.
B. In any major subdivision, it shall be the duty of the Planning Board to
classify proposed streets according to their types. The Planning Board,
in making its decisions, shall refer to the Master Plan and/or shall
consider conditions within the subdivision and surrounding area. The
right-of-way width shall be measured from lot line to lot line and shall
not be less than the following.103
C. Bikeways shall be included on all roadways as indicated on the Master
Plan or Official Map. Where the bicycle lane is part of a roadway
system, the bicycle lane shall be four feet in each direction and shall be
appropriately designated with a combination of signing and road
markings.
103. Editor's Note: See Table I, Primary Roadways, included at the end of this chapter.
§ 85-19 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 85-20
82:413
D. In those instances where a proposed subdivision abuts an existing
subdivision where existing stub or cul-de-sac streets may be extended,
the Planning Board may deem such extended streets "minor" in nature
for purposes of classification, provided that such extended street will
only serve traffic having either origins or destinations on the street.
E. In a subdivision abutting major arterials, minor arterials or major
collector streets, the frontage shall be reversed so that the lots
contiguous to such major arterials, minor arterials and major collector
streets will front on the minor collectors, local streets or cul-de-sac
streets, with an additional lot depth of 25 feet over and above zoning
requirements as an easement exclusively for planting and screening, to
be provided by the developer and maintained by the lot owner. For
these lots, the Planning Board shall require the developer to provide a
fence with an access gate along the easement in addition to the
plantings and screening, to be maintained by the lot owner, or a suitable
buffer shall be provided, as the Planning Board may determine
appropriate.
F. Lots abutting a railroad right-of-way shall have an additional depth of
75 feet over and above the zoning requirements from the railroad rightof-
way and a sound barrier of a material capable of reflecting noise and
not transmitting noise placed within the seventy-five-foot strip parallel
to the railroad right-of-way as per the Township Engineer's instructions.
G. The widths of internal streets in a multifamily, business or industrial
development designed as a whole in accordance with a comprehensive
site plan shall be determined by the Planning Board in each case in the
light of the circumstances of the particular situation and with a view to
assuring the maximum safety and convenience of access for traffic and
fire-fighting equipment, circulation and parking, including provisions
for the loading and unloading of goods, but in no case shall the
pavement be less than 26 feet in width for two-way traffic.
H. Internal streets and parking areas in multifamily, business or industrial
development shall not be constructed in building setback areas.
I. There shall be no reserved strips or areas for controlling access to
streets except where control and disposal of the land comprising such
strips or areas have been placed in the hands of the governing body
under conditions approved by the Planning Board.
J. When a subdivision abuts on existing streets, the street shall be
widened (if necessary) and improved to conform to this chapter.
K. The pavement width for all local streets in the R-100 Zone may be
reduced to 26 feet with a stabilized two-inch lawn over a four-inch stone
base shoulder 15 feet in width on each side thereof.
L. In the R-100 Zone, the proposed local streets will not interconnect with
existing or proposed streets in other classifications to form continuous
routes. They will be designed to discourage any through traffic, will

more than 10° and not more than 45°, they shall be connected by a
curve with a center line radius of not less than 100 feet for minor
streets and 500 feet for arterials and major collector streets measured
along the center line. When connecting street lines deflect from each
other at any point by more than 45°, they shall be connected by a curve
with a radius of not less than 500 feet measured along the center line.
E. All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical curves of sufficient
radius to provide a smooth transition and proper site distance and
drainage as determined by the Township Engineer.
F. Dead-end streets (culs-de-sac) in residential areas shall not be longer
than 600 feet and shall provide a turnaround at the end with the radius
of 50 feet to the outside edge of the cartway or curbline and 60 feet to
the outside edge of the right-of-way and be tangent whenever possible
to the right side of the right side of the street. The length of the cul-desac
shall be measured along its center line from its intersection with the
intersection streets' center line to the center of the radius of the cul-desac.
If a dead end is of a temporary nature, a similar turnaround shall be
provided and provisions made for future extension of the street and
reversion of the access right-of-way to the adjoining property owners.
G. No street shall have a name which will duplicate, or so nearly duplicate
as to be confused with. the names of existing streets in the Township or
its vicinity. The continuation of an existing street shall have the same
name. The Planning Board shall reserve the right to approve or name
streets within a proposed subdivision. All house identification numbers
shall be seen clearly from the street.

Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction and supplements
thereto on file in the Township Engineer's office.
A. The intersections of two streets shall be as nearly at right angles as is
possible, and in no case shall be less than 60°. The block corners at
intersections shall be rounded at the curbline with a curve having a
radius of not less than 25 feet.
B. Only one point of access and one point of egress may be allowed each
property, except where large frontages are present. In those latter
cases, streets shall not enter the same side of major collector streets at
intervals of less than 800 feet or major or minor arterial streets at
intervals of less than 1,200 feet. Streets or drives which enter a minor
or major street from opposite sides shall either be directly opposite to
each other or shall be separated by at least 200 feet between their
center lines measured along the center line of the intersected street.
C. Approaches of any collector street to any intersection of another
collector or an arterial shall follow a straight line course within 100 feet
of the intersection.
D. Where a major collector street or a minor collector serving more than
100 residential lots or dwelling units intersects with another collector
or an arterial, both the right-of-way and the pavement for the larger
roadway, shall be widened by 12 feet for a distance of 200 feet both
ways from the intersection of the center lines and tapered.
E. In addition to right-of-way widths required for full length of streets and
wider intersections as specified, sight triangles shall be dedicated as
follows: the area bounded by the right-of-way lines and a straight line
connecting sight points on street center lines which are the following
distances from the intersection of the center lines:
(1) Where a local street intersects another local street or minor
collector: 90 feet.

(2) Where a local street intersects a major collector street: 90 feet on
the minor and 200 feet on the major collector.
(3) Where a local street, minor or major collector street intersects an
arterial street: 90 feet back on the minor or collector streets and
300 feet back on the arterial streets.
F. No fences or any other obstruction nor any planting exceeding 24
inches in height as measured on a horizontal from the center line of the
road may be placed in any sight triangle.
G. Unless necessary to provide access to a lot in separate ownership
existing before the date of this section, no driveway access to property
or additional street intersection may be permitted within the extra
widths or sight triangles as specified herein.

A. Fire lanes shall be provided in accordance with the Uniform
Construction Code,104 as amended. Depending upon a building's design
configuration and use, location of its egress points with respect to a
public street or fire apparatus space and location of fire hydrants, the
requirements of the Code may be increased by the Planning Board
during the course of site plan review upon receipt and acceptance of a
report from the Township's Fire Official or Board of Fire
Commissioners, justifying why such increases are necessary.
[Amended 8-9-1995 by Ord. No. 0-95-27]
B. The minimum construction standards for a fire lane shall be:
(1) Minimum width: 18 feet.
(2) Marked by pairs of signs, plantings or other methods approved by

82:417
intervals as determined by the Fire Official and/or Township
Engineer during all weather conditions.
(3) Design and construction.
(a) Design and construction adequate to support for test and
actual use, the fire equipment in the use of the fire-fighting
service of the Township. For Township fire equipment, this
requires that fire lanes be constructed to support a live load of
3.5 tons per square foot under any weather condition. It also
requires that turning radiuses be sufficient to allow the fire
equipment to maneuver around the curves while being within
fire-fighting distance of the building. The minimum turning
radius for the Township fire equipment for a hard surface lane
is 29 feet inside turning radius and 51 feet outside turning
radius. Turf lanes will require greater radiuses depending on
specific site grade and soil conditions. The Planning Board
shall approve the fire lane design based on recommendations
from the Township Engineer, Fire Official, and Board of Fire
Commissioners. [Amended 8-9-1995 by Ord. No. 0-95-27]
(b) Suggested fire lane design and construction shall include, but
not be limited to, five inches of bituminous concrete pavement,
a twelve-inch thickness of quarry process road stone (which
may be reduced to a ten-inch thickness if the surface is treated
with asphalt cement and stone or gravel) or precast concrete
panels. Topsoil seeded or sod (maximum of two inches) on a
fire lane shall be allowed as long as the topsoil is mixed
uniformly with 50% one-fourth-inch to one-half-inch clean
crushed stone and all performance standards are met.
(4) Fire lanes need not be separate accessways but may be
incorporated as part of an off-street parking, access aisles,
walkways or other features as long as they are properly posted and
adequately designed to support fire-fighting equipment. Fire lanes
shall not be obstructed to impede fire apparatus access.
(5) Fire lanes shall at all times be maintained so as to meet the
standards and purposes for which they were designed.
Maintenance shall include snow removal over the full width of fire
lanes after accumulation of four inches.
(6) The Township shall establish a schedule for fire-lane inspection at
the discretion of the Fire Official to ensure that they meet the
performance standards specified herein. The full cost of the
inspection shall be borne by the owner, developer or applicant, and
the owner shall provide the testing equipment.

§ 85-21. Street signs.
Street signs shall be metal on metal posts of the type, design and standard
previously installed elsewhere in the Township. The location of the street
signs shall be determined by the Board, but there shall be at least two street
signs furnished at each intersection. All signs shall be installed free of visual
obstruction.

§ 85-23. Curbing. [Amended 5-1-1979 by Ord. No. 0-79-8]
Belgian block or concrete curbs shall be installed along every street within
a subdivision and at intersections with existing Township, county or state
roads and shall be laid in a manner approved by the Municipal Engineer.
However, curbs may not be required in the R-100 Zone except where
excessive grades or other conditions require their installation.
A. Sidewalks shall be required on both sides of all streets serving a
collector or primary local function as stipulated in the adopted Master
Plan and/or Official Map of the Township and as further required by the
Planning Board. Additionally, sidewalks shall be required for all local
streets within residential developments, as well as in nonresidential
developments at the Board's discretion, depending upon the probable
volume of pedestrian traffic, the development's location in relation to
other populated areas and the general type of improvement intended.
However, sidewalks may not be required in the R-100 Zone. [Amended
5-1-1979 by Ord. No. 0-79-8]
B. Where required, sidewalks shall be at least five feet wide and located as
approved by the Board. Sidewalks shall be Class C concrete 4,000
pounds per square inch air-entrained, six inches thick at driveways with
wire reinforcement or eight inches thick without such reinforcement.
C. Construction of curbs, gutters and walks at all street intersections must
be in compliance with standards of the New Jersey Department of
Transportation which provide for curb ramps for the physically
handicapped.
A. If concrete, the curbing shall meet the following specifications:
(1) The concrete to be used for curbs shall be Class B 4,500 pounds per
square inch air-entrained concrete as specified in the New Jersey
State Highway Specifications for Curbs and Gutters.
(2) Expansion joints shall be provided at intervals of 20 feet and shall

A. Scope and purpose.
(1) Policy statement.
(a) The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
mandated that all states enact regulations to address the
negative impacts of stormwater runoff on the nation's streams
and water resources. The State of New Jersey adopted new
regulations at the direction of the EPA. Under these state
regulations, all municipalities in the state must implement
these stormwater regulations through local ordinance(s) by
April 2006. This section is intended to implement these
regulations.
(b) The purpose of these regulations is to control stormwater from
new major development and not to regulate preexisting
development. "Major development," under the terms of this
section, means any development that provides for ultimately
disturbing one or more acres of soil on a development site and/
or any development that provides an additional 1/4 acre of
impervious surface on a development site.
(c) Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant reduction
through nonstructural or low-impact techniques shall be
employed before relying on structural best management
practices (BMP), for stormwater, prepared by the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection. Structural BMPs
should be integrated with nonstructural stormwater
management strategies and proper maintenance plans.
Nonstructural strategies include both environmentally
sensitive site design and source controls that prevent
pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed
to stormwater. Source control plans should be developed based
upon physical site conditions and the origin, nature, and the
anticipated quantity or amount of potential pollutants. Multiple
stormwater management BMPs may be necessary to achieve
the established performance standards for water quality,
quantity, and groundwater recharge.
(2) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for major
development and to reduce the amount of nonpoint source
pollution entering surface water and groundwaters. This section
§ 85-28 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 85-28.1
82:423
guides new development in a manner that is proactive and
minimizes harmful impacts to natural resources. Specifically, this
section shall:
(a) Reduce flood damage to protect public health, life and
property.
(b) Minimize increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes.
(c) Minimize the deterioration of existing structures that would
result from increased rates of stormwater runoff.
(d) Induce water recharge into the ground wherever suitable
infiltration, soil permeability, and favorable geological
conditions exist.
(e) Prevent an increase in nonpoint source pollution.
(f) Maintain the integrity and stability of stream channels and
buffers for their ecological functions, as well as for drainage,
the conveyance of floodwater, and other purposes.
(g) Control and minimize soil erosion and the transport of
sediment.
(h) Minimize public safety hazards at any stormwater detention
facility constructed pursuant to subdivision or site plan
approval.
(i) Maintain adequate baseflow and natural flow regimes in all
streams and other surface water bodies to protect the aquatic
ecosystem.
(j) Protect all surface water resources from degradation.
(k) Protect groundwater resources from degradation and
diminution.
(l) Ensure that any additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface
complies with this section.
(3) Applicability.
(a) This section shall be applicable to site plans and subdivisions,
considered individually and/or cumulatively, as of the date of
adoption of this section, for the following major developments:
[1] Nonresidential major developments.
[2] Aspects of residential major developments that are not
preempted by the Residential Site Improvement Standards
(RSIS) at N.J.A.C. 5:21.
[3] Residential development that meets the definition of
"major development," as defined in this section, i.e., any
§ 85-28.1 PLAINSBORO CODE § 85-28.1
82:424
development that provides for ultimately disturbing one or
more acres of soil and/or any development that provides
an additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface on a
development site.
[4] Any agricultural or horticultural development that meets
the definition of "major development" under N.J.A.C. 7:8.
(b) This section shall also be applicable to all major developments
undertaken by Plainsboro Township.
(4) Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements.
Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans
pursuant to this section are to be considered an integral part of
development approvals under the subdivision and site plan review
process and do not relieve the applicant of the responsibility to
secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any
other applicable code, rule, act, or ordinance. In their
interpretation and application, the provisions of this section shall
be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the
public health, safety and general welfare. This section shall be
construed to assure consistency with the requirements of New
Jersey laws and acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto,
applicable implementing regulations, and any existing or future
municipal NJPDES permits and any amendments or revisions
thereto or reissuance thereof. This section is not intended to
interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinances, rule or
regulation, statute, or other provision of law except that, where any
provision of this section imposes restrictions different from those
imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other
provision of law, the more restrictive provisions or higher
standards shall control.
B. Definitions. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in
this section shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they
have in common usage and to give this section its most reasonable

(4) A waiver by the Planning Board, upon concurrence by the
Stormwater Coordinator, from strict compliance from the
groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity, and
stormwater runoff quality requirements of Subsection D(6) and (7)
may be obtained for the enlargement of an existing public roadway
or railroad; or the construction or enlargement of a public
pedestrian access, provided that the following conditions are met:
(a) The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the
project that cannot be accomplished by any other means;
(b) The applicant demonstrates through an alternatives analysis,
that through the use of nonstructural and structural
stormwater management strategies and measures, the option
selected complies with the requirements of Subsection D(6)
and (7) to the maximum extent practicable;
(c) The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the
requirements of Subsection D(6) and (7), existing structures
currently in use, such as homes and buildings, would need to

to mitigate the requirements of Subsection D(6) and (7) that
were not achievable on site.
(5) Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
(a) To the maximum extent practicable the standards in
Subsection D(6) and (7) shall be met by incorporating
nonstructural stormwater management strategies set forth at
Subsection D(5) into the design. The applicant shall identify
the nonstructural measures incorporated into the design of the
project. If the applicant contends that it is not feasible for
engineering, environmental, or safety reasons to incorporate
any nonstructural stormwater management measures
identified in Subsection D(5)(b) below into the design of a

[9] Provide other source controls to prevent or minimize the
use or exposure of pollutants at the site, in order to
prevent or minimize the release of those pollutants into
stormwater runoff. Such source controls can include, but
are not limited to:
[a] Site design features that help to prevent accumulation
of trash and debris in drainage systems, including
features that satisfy Subsection D(5)(c) below;

[1] Grates.
[a] Design engineers shall use either of the following
grates to collect stormwater from a surface into a
storm drain or surface water body under that grate:
[i] The New Jersey Department of Transportation
(NJDOT) bicycle-safe grate, which is described in
Chapter 2.4 of the NJDOT Bicycle Compatible
Roadways and Bikeways Planning and Design
Guidelines (April 1996); or
[ii] A different grate, if each individual clear space in
that grate has an area of no more than seven
square inches, or is no greater than 0.5 inches

clear space in that curb opening (or each individual clear
space, if the curb opening has two or more clear spaces)
shall have an area of no more than seven square inches, or
be no greater than two inches across the smallest
dimension.
[3] This standard does not apply:
[a] Where the Planning Board, with the recommendation
of the Stormwater Coordinator, determines that this
standard would cause inadequate hydraulic
performance that could not feasibly be corrected by
using additional or larger storm drain inlets that meet
these standards;
[b] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in Subsection D(7)(a) are conveyed through
any device (e.g., end of pipe netting facility,
manufactured treatment device, or a catch basin
hood) that is designed, at a minimum, to prevent
delivery of all solid and floatable materials that could
not pass through one of the following:
[i] A rectangular space four and five-eighths inches
long and 1 1/2 inches wide (this option does not
apply for outfall netting facilities); or
[ii] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inches;
[c] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that
has parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the
bars, to the elevation of the water quality design storm

[d] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c),
that action to meet this standard is an undertaking
that constitutes an encroachment or will damage or
destroy the National and/or New Jersey Register listed
historic property or district, within the meaning of the
"Historic Places Rules."
(d) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater
management measure to meet the performance standards in
§ 85-28.1 PLAINSBORO CODE § 85-28.1
82:434
Subsection D(6) and (7) shall be dedicated to a government
agency, subjected to a conservation restriction filed with the
appropriate County Clerk's office, or subject to an approved
equivalent restriction that ensures that measure or an
equivalent stormwater management measure approved by the
Stormwater Coordinator, is maintained in perpetuity. The
approved form to be used as a conservation restriction shall
be determined by the Township Attorney and shall be reviewed
and approved by the Township Attorney as to form and by the
Township Engineer as to description, on a case-by-case basis.
To the greatest extent feasible, nonstructural stormwater
management strategies shall be used and shall comply with
those listed in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from
the address identified in Subsection D(7) or found on the
Department's website at www.njstormwater.org.
(6) Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity
standards.
(a) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration
and groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff
quantity impacts of major development.
[1] The minimum design and performance standards for
erosion control are those established under the Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq.,
and implementing rules.
[2] The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[a] The design engineer and Stormwater Coordinator
shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at Subsection D(5), either:
[i] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater
management measures maintain 100% of the
average annual preconstruction groundwater
recharge volume for the site; or
[ii] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff
volume from preconstruction to postconstruction
for the two-year storm is infiltrated.
[b] The following types of stormwater shall not be
recharged:
§ 85-28.1 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 85-28.1
82:435
[i] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading.
High pollutant loading areas are areas in
industrial and commercial developments where
solvents and/or petroleum products are loaded/
unloaded, stored, or applied, areas where
pesticides are loaded/unloaded or stored; areas
where hazardous materials are expected to be
present in greater than reportable quantities as
defined by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR 302.4; areas
where recharge would be inconsistent with
Department-approved remedial action work plan
or landfill closure plan and areas with high risks
for spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations
and vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[ii] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
"Source material" means any material(s) or
machinery, located at an industrial facility that is
directly or indirectly related to process,
manufacturing, or other industrial activities,
which could be a source of pollutants in any
industrial stormwater discharge to groundwater.
Source materials include, but are not limited to,
raw materials; intermediate products; final
products; waste materials; byproducts; industrial
machinery and fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and
detergents that are related to process,
manufacturing, or other industrial activities that
are exposed to stormwater.
[c] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact
on the groundwater table and design the site so as to
avoid adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse
hydraulic impacts include, but are not limited to,
exacerbating a naturally or seasonally high water
table so as to cause surface ponding, flooding of
basements, or interference with the proper operation
of subsurface sewage disposal systems and other
subsurface structures in the vicinity or down gradient
of the groundwater recharge area.
[3] In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors
for stormwater runoff calculations at Subsection E,
complete one of the following:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that for stormwater leaving the site,
postconstruction runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten-,
and one-hundred-year storm events do not exceed, at
§ 85-28.1 PLAINSBORO CODE § 85-28.1
82:436
any point in time, the preconstruction runoff
hydrographs for the same storm events;
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that there is no increase, as compared to the
predevelopment condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten-, and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased
volume or change in timing of stormwater runoff will
not increase flood damage at or downstream of the
site. This analysis shall include the analysis of impacts
of existing land uses and projected land uses assuming
full development under existing zoning and land use
ordinances in the drainage area; or
[c] Design stormwater management measures so that the
postconstruction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten-,
and one-hundred-year storm events are 50, 75 and
80% respectively, of the predevelopment peak runoff
rates. The percentages apply only to the
postconstruction stormwater runoff that is
attributable to the portion of the site on which the
proposed development or project is to be constructed.
The percentages shall not be applied to
postconstruction stormwater runoff into tidal flood
hazard areas if the increased volume of stormwater
runoff will not increase flood damages below the point
of discharge.
(b) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets
the definition of "major development" at Subsection B shall be
submitted to the appropriate Soil Conservation District for
review and approval in accordance with the requirements of
this section and any applicable Soil Conservation District
guidelines for stormwater runoff quantity and erosion control.
For the purposes of this section, "agricultural development"
means land uses normally associated with the production of
food, fiber and livestock for sale. Such uses do not include the
development of land for the processing or sale of food and the
manufacturing of agriculturally related products.
(7) Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(a) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to
reduce the postconstruction load of total suspended solids
(TSS) in stormwater runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from
the developed site, expressed as an annual average.
Stormwater management measures shall only be required for
water quality control if an additional 1/4-acre of impervious
surface is being proposed on a development site. The
requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to any stormwater
§ 85-28.1 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 85-28.1
82:437
runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric effluent
limitation for TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A,
or in a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit
from this requirement. The water quality design storm is 1.25
inches of rainfall in two hours. Water quality calculations shall
take into account the distribution of rain from the water quality
design storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation of the
volume of runoff may take into account the implementation
of nonstructural and structural stormwater management
measures.

(b) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below
presents the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs
designed in accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be
obtained from the address identified in Subsection G, or found
on the Department's website at www.njstormwater.org. The
BMP Manual and other sources of technical guidance are listed
in Subsection G. TSS reduction shall be calculated based on
the removal rates for the BMP in Table 2 below. Alternative
removal rates and methods of calculating removal rates may be
used if the design engineer provides documentation
demonstrating the capability of these alternative rates and
methods to the review agency. A copy of any approved
alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall
§ 85-28.1 PLAINSBORO CODE § 85-28.1
82:438
be provided to the Department at the following address:
Division of Watershed Management, New Jersey Department
of Environmental Protection, PO Box 418, Trenton, New Jersey
08625-0418.
(c) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the
required 80% TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall
utilize the following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A + B - (AXB)/100
Where
R = Total TSS percent load removal from application of both
BMP.
A = The TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first
BMP.
B = The TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second
BMP.

(d) If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the 80% TSS
removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the
runoff from the subareas converge on site in which case the
removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using
a weighted average.
(e) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent practiable, the
postconstruction nutrient load of the anticipated load from the
developed site in stormwater runoff generated from the water
quality design storm. In achieving reduction of nutrients to the
maximum extent practiable, the design of the site shall include
nonstructural strategies and structural measures that optimize
nutrient removal while still achieving the performance
standards in Subsection D(6) and (7).
§ 85-28.1 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 85-28.1
82:439
(f) Developers shall comply with the New Jersey Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual, which may be obtained from
the address identified in Subsection G, or
www.njstormwater.org. For development projects where
differing standards may apply, the stricter requirement shall be
followed.
(g) In accordance with the definition of "FW1" at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to
prevent any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified
as FW1.
(h) Special water resource protection areas shall be established
along all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and
perennial or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream
of the Category One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle
Maps or in the County Soil Surveys, within the associated
HUC14 drainage area. These areas shall be established for the
protection of water quality, aesthetic value, exceptional
ecological significance, exceptional recreational significance,
exceptional water supply significance, and exceptional
fisheries significance of those established Category One
waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
[1] The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[a] A three-hundred-foot special water resource
protection area shall be provided on each side of the
waterway, measured perpendicular to the waterway
from the top of the bank outwards or from the center
line of the waterway where the bank is not defined,
consisting of existing vegetation or vegetation allowed
to follow natural succession is provided.
[b] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under Subsection
D(7)(h)[1][a] above shall only be allowed with the
approval of the Stormwater Coordinator, where
previous development or disturbance has occurred.
The encroachment shall only be allowed where
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource
protection area will be maintained to the maximum
extent practicable. In no case shall the remaining
special water resource protection area be reduced to
less than 150 feet as measured perpendicular to the
top of bank of the waterway or center line of the
waterway where the bank is undefined. All
§ 85-28.1 PLAINSBORO CODE § 85-28.1
82:440
encroachments proposed under this subsection shall
be subject to review and approval by the Department.
[2] All stormwater shall be discharged outside of, and flow
through, the special water resource protection area and
shall comply with the Standard for Off-Site Stability in the
"Standards For Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New
Jersey," established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment
Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq.
[3] If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through
the special water resource protection area cannot comply
with the Standard for Off-Site Stability in the "Standards
for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey"
established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., then the stabilization
measures in accordance with the requirements of the
above standards may be placed within the special water
resource protection area, provided that:
[a] Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150
feet of the Category One waterway;
[b] Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by
this section shall achieve a 95% TSS postconstruction
removal rate;
[c] Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact
on the receiving waterway;
[d] The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource
protection area will be maintained to the maximum

[e] A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with
the appropriate Department staff and Soil
Conservation District staff to identify necessary
stabilization measures; and
[f] All encroachments proposed under this section shall
be subject to review and approval by the Department,
prior to local approval(s).
[4] A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as
an element of a regional stormwater management plan, or
by a municipality through an adopted municipal
stormwater management plan. If a stream corridor
protection plan for a waterway subject to Subsection
D(7)(h) has been approved by the Department, then the
§ 85-28.1 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 85-28.1
82:441
provisions of the plan shall be the applicable special water
resource protection area requirements for that waterway.
A stream corridor protection plan for a waterway subject
to Subsection D(7) shall maintain or enhance the current
functional value and overall condition of the special water
resource protection area as defined in Subsection
D(7)(h)[1][a] above. In no case shall a stream corridor
protection plan allow the reduction of the special water
resource protection area to less than 150 feet as measured
perpendicular to the waterway subject to this subsection.
[5] Subsection D(7)(h) does not apply to the construction of
one individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a
larger development on a lot receiving preliminary or final
subdivision approval on or before February 2, 2004,
provided that the construction begins on or before
February 2, 2009.
E. Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge.
(1) Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the
following:
(a) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
[1] The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service
(NRCS) methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation
and Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the
NRCS National Engineering Handbook Section 4 
Hydrology and Technical Release 55  Urban Hydrology
for Small Watersheds; or
[2] The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified
Rational Method for hydrograph computations.
(b) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and
groundwater recharge, there is a presumption that the
predevelopment condition of a site or portion thereof is a
wooded land use with good hydrologic condition. The term
"runoff coefficient" applies to both the NRCS methodology at
Subsection E(1)(a)[1] and the Rational and Modified Rational
Methods at Subsection E(1)(a)[2].
(c) In computing predevelopment stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows,
or culverts that may reduce predevelopment stormwater runoff
rates and volumes.
(d) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the
design engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff
§ 85-28.1 PLAINSBORO CODE § 85-28.1
82:442
rates and/or volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces
separately to accurately compute the rates and volume of
stormwater runoff from the site. To calculate runoff from
unconnected impervious cover, urban impervious area
modifications as described in the NRCS Technical Release 55 -
Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds and other methods may
be employed.
(2) Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
following: The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32 A
Method for Evaluating Ground-Water Recharge Areas in New
Jersey, incorporated herein by reference as amended and
supplemented. Information regarding the methodology is available
from the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices
Manual; at http://www.state.nj.us/dep/njgs/; or at New Jersey
Geological Survey, 29 Arctic Parkway, P.O. Box 427, Trenton, New
Jersey 08625-0427; (609) 984-6587.
F. Standards for structural stormwater management measures.
(1) Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as
follows:
(a) Structural stormwater management measures shall be
designed to take into account the existing site conditions,
including, for example, environmentally critical areas,
wetlands; flood-prone areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high
water table; soil type, permeability and texture; drainage area
and drainage patterns.
(b) Structural stormwater management measures shall be
designed to minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and
repairs, and ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be
installed at the intake to the outlet structure as appropriate,
and shall have parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the
bars to the elevation of the water quality design storm. For
elevations higher than the water quality design storm, the
parallel bars at the outlet structure shall be spaced no greater
than 1/3 the width of the diameter of the orifice or 1/3 the
width of the weir, with a minimum spacing between bars of one
inch and a maximum spacing between bars of six inches. In
addition, the design of trash racks must comply with the
requirements of Subsection H(4).
(c) Structural stormwater management measures shall be
designed, sequenced, constructed, and installed to be strong,
durable, and corrosion resistant. Measures that are consistent
with the relevant portions of the Residential Site Improvement
Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3, 7.4, and 7.5 shall be deemed to
meet this requirement.
§ 85-28.1 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 85-28.1
82:443
(d) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management
basin, the orifice size shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 inches in
diameter.
(e) Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins
at Subsection H.
(f) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater
management measure is below the flood hazard design flood
elevation as defined at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall
take into account the effects of tail water in the design of
structural stormwater management measures.
(2) Stormwater management measure guidelines are available in the
New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. Other
stormwater management measures may be utilized provided the
design engineer demonstrates that the proposed measure and its
design will accomplish the required water quantity, groundwater
recharge and water quality design and performance standards
established by Subsection D of this section.
(3) Manufactured treatment devices may be used to meet the
requirements of Subsection D of this section, only when
recommended by the Stormwater Coordinator, provided the
pollutant removal rates are verified by the New Jersey Corporation
for Advanced Technology and certified by the Department.
Manufactured treatment devices may be used only where the
maintenance plan required by Subsection J ensures that the
manufactured device will be properly maintained for its functional
lifespan and will be replaced as needed with management
measures that are at least as effective as the original manufactured
treatment device working in accordance with manufacturers
specifications.

(1) This subsection sets forth requirements to protect public safety
through the proper design and operation of stormwater
management basins. This subsection applies to any new
stormwater management basin.
(2) Requirements for trash racks, overflow grates and escape
provisions.
(a) A trash rack is a device designed to catch runoff-borne trash
and debris and prevent the clogging of outlet structures. Trash
racks shall be installed at the intake to the outlet from the
stormwater management basin to ensure proper functioning of
the basin outlets in accordance with the following:
[1] The trash rack should be constructed primarily of bars
aligned in the direction of flow with a maximum bar
spacing of approximately 1/2 the diameter or width of the
hydraulic opening it is protecting. Transverse bars aligned
perpendicular to flow should be sized and spaced as
necessary for rack stability and strength.
§ 85-28.1 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 85-28.1
82:445
[2] The trash rack shall be designed so as not to adversely
affect the hydraulic performance of the outlet pipe or
structure.
[3] The average velocity of flow through a clean trash rack is
not to exceed 2.5 feet per second under the full range of
stage and discharge. Velocity is to be computed based on
the net area of opening through the rack.
[4] The trash rack shall be constructed and installed to be
rigid, durable, and corrosion resistant, and shall be
designed to withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300
pounds per square foot.
(b) An overflow grate is designed to prevent obstruction of the
opening in the top of the overflow structure. If an outlet
structure has an overflow grate, such grate shall meet the
following requirements:
[1] The overflow grate shall be secured to the outlet structure
but removable for emergencies and maintenance.
[2] The overflow grate spacing shall be no less than two
inches across the smallest dimension.
[3] The overflow grate shall be constructed and installed to be
rigid, durable, and corrosion resistant, and shall be
designed to withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300
pounds per square foot.
(c) For purposes of this subsection, "escape provisions" means the
permanent installation of ladders, steps, rungs, or other
features that provide easily accessible means of egress from
stormwater management basins. Stormwater management
basins shall include escape provisions as follows:
[1] If a stormwater management basin has an outlet structure,
escape provisions shall be incorporated in or on the
structure. With the prior approval of the reviewing agency
identified in Subsection H(3), a freestanding outlet
structure may be exempted from this requirement.
[2] Safety ledges shall be constructed on the slopes of all new
stormwater management basins having a permanent pool
of water deeper than 2 1/2 feet. Such safety ledges shall be
comprised of two steps. Each step shall be four to six feet
in width. One step shall be located approximately 2 1/2
feet below the permanent water surface, and the second
step shall be located one to 1 1/2 feet above the permanent
water surface. See Subsection H(4) for an illustration of
safety ledges in a stormwater management basin.

[3] In new stormwater management basins, the maximum
interior slope for an earthen dam, embankment, or berm
shall not be steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.
[4] An emergency draw-down method for detention basins is
required where the permanent pool will be more than 2 1/
2 feet deep. This draw-down method must consider
downstream or off-site stability at the outfall in accordance
with the Standards for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
in New Jersey.
(3) Variance or exemption from safety standards. A variance or
exemption from the safety standards for stormwater management
basins may be granted only upon a written finding by the
appropriate reviewing agency (municipality, county or Department)
that the variance or exemption will not constitute a threat to public
safety.

shall arrange with the servicing utility for the underground installation
of the utilities' distribution supply lines and service connections in
accordance with the provisions of the applicable Standard Terms and
Conditions incorporated as a part of its tariff as the same are then on
file with the State of New Jersey Board of Public Utility Commissioners,
and the subdivider shall provide the municipality with three copies of a
final plat showing the installed location of these utilities. For minor
subdivisions, service connections shall be made underground where the
supply lines that serve the lands being subdivided are underground. For
major and minor subdivisions, the subdivider shall submit to the Board,
prior to the granting of final approval, a written instrument from each
serving utility which shall evidence full compliance or intended full
compliance with the provisions of this subsection; provided, however,
lots which in such subdivision(s) abut existing streets where overhead
electric or telephone distribution supply lines and service connections
have heretofore been installed may be supplied with electric and
telephone service from those overhead lines, but the service
connections from the utilities' overhead lines shall be installed
underground. In the case of existing overhead utilities, should a road
widening or an extension of service or other such condition occur as a
result of the subdivision and necessitate the replacement or relocation
of such utilities, such replacement or relocation shall be underground.
B. In large-scale development, easements along rear property lines or
elsewhere for utility installations may be required. Such easements
shall be at least 20 feet wide and located in consultation with the

shall be in addition to any other landscaping and street tree planting
which may be required by the Board.
B. Clearing trees and shrubs from a lot or filling around trees on a lot shall
not be permitted unless it can be shown that grading, construction
requirements and/or proposed building locations necessitate removal of
trees and shrubs. In this instance the treed portions of those lots or
other lots, designated by the Board to be of environmental value, shall
be replanted with native trees and shrubs to reestablish the character
of the impacted area as follows:
(1) All newly planted trees and shrubs shall be of nursery grown stock.
All landscape materials shall be of a species native to the area and
approved by the Planning Board, and the developer or property
owner shall guarantee replacement for two years.
(2) The quantity of trees to be replanted shall be equal to the number
of trees that would be necessary to cover the entire treed area
impacted by a development, based upon a grid of 20 by 20 feet. Of
this number of trees, 10% shall be balled and burlapped two-inch to
two-and-one-half-inch caliper; 20% shall be balled and burlapped
one-and-three-fourths-inch to two-inch caliper; 30% shall be bareroot
one-and-one-fourth-inch to one-and-one-half-inch caliper; and
40% shall be bare-root six- to eight-foot-tall whips. A mixture of
trees indigenous to the area and site shall be utilized.
(3) Trees shall be planted in natural groves and spaced five feet to 15
feet on center.
(4) The ground plane shall be seeded with a meadow grass mix. The
specific blend shall be approved by the Township Planning Board.
(5) All woody and herbaceous plants shall be species indigenous to the
area.
C. A reforestation program shall include a maintenance program for the
impacted area to be reviewed and approved by the Board.
D. In the event that the applicant cannot meet the tree preservation and
reforestation requirements on site, then the applicant, in cooperation
with the Planning Board or Zoning Board, shall provide reforestation
treatment for off-site tracts or contribute an amount equal to the cost of
reforestation of the on-site tract as determined by the Department of
Planning and Zoning. Off-site reforestation shall meet the same
standards as on-site reforestation. [Amended 12-12-2007 by Ord.
No. 0-07-25]
109. Editor's Note: This ordinance also provided that violations shall be subject to the penalty
provisions of the Plainsboro Township Code Violations Ordinance.
§ 85-30.1 PLAINSBORO CODE § 85-30.2
82:454
A. To protect desirable trees from environmental and mechanical injury
during construction activities as well as to protect certain species from
erosion and sediment control, shade, aesthetics, songbirds, other
wildlife, dust control, noise abatement and oxygen production, the
following factors shall be considered on any new development sites
containing valuable trees:
(1) Tree vigor. Vigor describes the overall health and physical
condition of the tree. A tree of low vigor is more susceptible to
damage by environmental changes, insect infestation and disease
than a healthy tree. Trees of poor vigor typically exhibit at least
some of the following conditions: minimal new growth, death of
limbs or branches (new growth is especially vulnerable),
undersized leaves, sparse foliage, poor foliage color and early fall
foliage coloration. Dangerously hollow or damaged trees with
cracked or split limbs or trunks, excessively leaning or crooked
trees, trees with bark separating from their trunks, trees with
wounds in the bark, trees with oozing sap or trees with major
portions of their canopy missing should be reviewed on an
individual basis.
(2) Tree age. Very old, picturesque trees may be more aesthetically
valuable than smaller, young trees, but will usually require more
extensive protection measures. Only vigorously growing, healthy
old trees should be protected. Indications of tree vigor previously
disturbed should be used to determine the selection of old trees to
be saved. Large, old trees with historic or prominent locations
should be carefully evaluated by landscape professionals before
being disturbed.
(3) Species. Many species of trees found in New Jersey woodlands are
not suitable for shade tree uses around buildings. Trees that are
short-lived or brittle or have soft wood, messy leaves or fruit or are
frequently attacked by insects and disease should be protected.
Trees shall be planted as determined by the Planning Board. All
newly planted trees shall be watered during dry seasons unless
prohibited by the Township.
(4) Wildlife benefits. Protecting trees that are preferred by wildlife for
food, cover and nesting will add to wildlife activity and diversity. A
mixture of evergreens and hardwoods is beneficial. Evergreen
trees provide cover during the winter months. The hardwoods
provide valuable food.
(5) Species longevity. Favor trees with long life spans, such as oak,
beech and tulip poplar. Short-lived trees should be avoided for use
as shade, lawn or specimen trees even though they may have an
attractive form or pleasing coloration in the spring or fall.
B. Soil compaction and physical damage to the roots, limbs and trunk are
the most common forms of damage to trees during the construction
§ 85-30.2 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 85-30.2
82:455
process. The compaction of soil within the dripline of a tree can damage
the soil structure and inhibit the transportation of water and air to
tree roots. To ensure the survival of trees selected to be preserved, the
following guidelines should be followed:
(1) Protect trees from mechanical damage. (See Figure 1.)110
(2) Protect trees scheduled to be preserved within 20 feet of a building
site and all vegetation beyond the designated limit of disturbance
lines to prevent mechanical and compaction injury. Fencing or
other approved barriers should be a minimum of four feet high and
installed at the tree's dripline. Installation should take place before
any site disturbance takes place. (See Figure 1.)111
(3) Boards will not be nailed to trees during building operations.
(4) Feeder roots should not be cut in an area within the dripline of the
tree's canopy.
(5) Damaged limbs or trunks shall be painted immediately with a high
quality of tree paint. Care for serious injury should be prescribed
by a professional forester or licensed tree expert.
(6) Tree limb removal, where necessary, will be done flush to the trunk
or main branch, and that area shall be painted with a high quality of
tree paint.
(7) Protect trees against unnecessary cutting, breaking or skinning of
roots or bark. Soil or construction materials should not be stored
within the dripline of any tree scheduled to be saved. Prohibit
vehicular traffic, parking Of vehicles or excessive foot traffic within
the dripline.
(8) Root damage on any root over 1 1/2 inches in diameter shall be
treated with tree paint in the same manner as treatment to a cut
limb. Temporarily cover all exposed roots with wet burlap to
prevent the roots from drying out, and cover exposed roots with
soil as soon as possible.
(9) Water trees and other vegetation protected from construction
traffic as required to maintain their health during the course of
construction operations.
(10) Avoid changing the existing ground elevation within the dripline of
trees scheduled to be saved. If grade changes are absolutely
necessary, grade changes should be accomplished by following the
examples of Figure 2.112
110. Editor's Note: Figure 1 is included at the end of this chapter.

C. Prohibited acts. No person shall do or cause to be done any of the
following acts affecting trees or shrubbery planted or growing naturally
within areas that are affected by this chapter:
(1) Cut, trim, break, girdle, disturb the roots of or injure any living tree
or damage, misuse or remove any structure or device placed to
support or protect any tree.
(2) Plant or remove any living tree or climb any living tree with spikes.
(3) Fasten any rope, wire, electrical attachment, sign, reflector or
other device to a tree or to any guard around a tree.
(4) Close or obstruct any open space around the base of a tree which
permits the access of air, water or fertilizer to the roots of the tree.
(5) Place any guy wire, brace, rope or other device on any tree in such
a manner as to injure it.
(6) Permit any brine, petroleum-based product or injurious chemical or
liquid to come in contact with the trunk or roots of a tree on any
street.
(7) Building a fire or station any tar kettle or engine in such a manner
that heat or noxious fumes will penetrate the dripline of any nearby
tree.
(8) Dam or obstruct any watercourse so as to result in flooding of
adjacent treed areas or artificially change the water table near
trees.
(9) Create impervious surfaces within the limits of the dripline.
A. Lot dimensions and area shall not be less than the requirements of the
Zoning Ordinance.113
B. Insofar as is practical, side lot lines shall be either at right angles or
radial to street lines.
C. Each lot must front upon an approved public street with a right-of-way
of at least 50 feet in width, except planned developments on private
streets maintained by the owner.
D. Where extra width has been dedicated for widening of existing streets,
lots shall begin at such new street line and all setbacks shall be
measured from such line.
E. Where there is a question as to the suitability of a lot or lots for their
intended use due to factors such as poor drainage conditions or flood
conditions where percolation tests or test borings show the ground

sewage treatment or similar circumstances, the Board may, after
adequate investigation, withhold approval of such lots. If approval is
withheld, the Board shall give reasons and notify the applicant and
enter same in the minutes.
A. Where public water is accessible for single-family residential units, the
applicant may construct water mains in such a manner as to make
adequate water service available to each lot or dwelling unit within the
subdivision or development. The entire system shall be designed in
accordance with the requirements and standards of the local and/or
state agency having approval authority and shall be subject to its
approval. The system shall also be designed with adequate capacity and
sustained pressure.
B. Where no public water is accessible, water shall be furnished by the
subdivider on an individual lot basis. If wells are installed on each lot
and the lot also contains its own sewage disposal facilities, the wells
shall be of the drilled type with a minimum of 40 feet of casing. Well
installation, sealing and testing shall be in accordance with the New
Jersey Standards for Construction of Water Supply Systems in Realty
Improvements (Chapter 199 of the Public Laws of 1954, as amended).
The well will be required to have a production of not less than six
gallons per minute as established by bailer tests and certified by the
well driller. Before being placed in consumer use, it shall be disinfected
by the use of sodium hypochlorite or other acceptable solutions, and a
sample shall be collected by a local or State Health Department
representative for bacteriological examination. A copy of the result of
the above-referred-to bailer tests and bacteriological examination and a
certificate from the local or State Health Officer that the owner has
complied with the applicable local or state health regulations shall be
submitted to the municipality before the issuance of construction
permits in connection with each individual lot in the subdivision.
A. If a public treatment and collection system is accessible, the applicant
shall construct facilities in such a manner as to make adequate sewage
treatment available to each lot within the subdivision from said
treatment and collection system.
B. Any treatment plant and collection system, including individual on-site
septic systems, shall be designed in accordance with the requirements
of the State Department of Environmental Protection or Township
ordinances, whichever is more restrictive, and shall be subject to
approval by the Township Department of Health.

(2) Each parking space shall be a minimum of nine feet in width by 18
feet in length. Alternatively, parking spaces may be reduced to 16
feet in length where vehicles overhang landscaped areas or
expanded pedestrian walkways by a minimum of two feet, subject
to Board approval. With the exception of preexisting painted
parking spaces, all new parking spaces shall be delineated using
hairpin striping. Each hairpin stripe separating adjacent parking
spaces shall include two parallel, four-inch-wide white trafficpainted
stripes placed two feet apart straddling the imaginary line
that defines each nine-foot-wide parking space. All parking areas
shall be provided with permanent and durable curbing to assist in
orderly parking and separate pedestrian walkways from vehicular
traffic, unless alternative treatment is warranted and approved by
waiver by the Board. If walkways or curbed landscaped areas are
not provided adjacent to parking spaces, front-wheel stops (staked-
, black-, or rubber-type only) or alternative treatment may be
provided, subject to Board approval.
(3) Handicapped parking shall be provided in accordance with the
standards of the U. S. Architectural and Transportation Barriers
Compliance Board requirements pursuant to the Americans with
Disabilities Act, and shall be subject to the review and approval of
the Township Construction Code Official.
(4) A parking space that abuts a fixed object such as a wall or column,
whether within a structure or not, shall have a minimum width of
10 feet.
C. The number of parking spaces for each use shall be determined by the
number of dwelling units, the amount of gross floor area as defined in
this chapter or such other measure as noted above. Where a particular
function contains more than one use, the minimum parking
requirements shall be the sum of the component parts. Where an
applicant can demonstrate that fewer parking spaces would be
required, the Planning Board may allow a lower number, provided the

applicant shows on the site plan how the required additional spaces
could be added if necessary.
A. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until all terms of the final
approval of the site plan have been met, including furnishing as-built
plans prepared by a licensed land surveyor or professional engineer
showing finished floor elevations, site evaluation at property corners
and sufficient intermediate points to indicate surface water runoff. In
addition, all utility service connections are to be shown on such plans as
well as all setback distances to the buildings.
B. The Construction Official may grant a temporary certificate of
occupancy for a specified period of time not exceeding six months if
weather or other conditions beyond the control of the applicant prevent
compliance with the conditions of final approval of the site plan. The
Construction Official shall notify the Planning Board of the issuance of
the temporary certificate of occupancy and its date of expiration.

ARTICLE XI
Off-Tract Improvements
§ 85-46. Off-tract water, sewer, drainage and street improvements.
A. The developer shall pay the developer's pro rata share of the cost of
providing reasonable and necessary street improvements and water,
sewerage and drainage facilities, and easements therefor, located
outside the property limits of the developer's subdivision or
development but necessitated or required by construction or
improvements within such subdivision or development. Such
improvements shall be deemed reasonable and necessary when they
are set forth in the circulation plan element and the utility service plan
element of the Township Master Plan.
B. The standards by which the Township Committee shall determine the
proportionate or pro rata amount of the cost of the facilities to be borne
by each developer or owner within a related and common area shall not
be altered subsequent to preliminary subdivision or site plan approval,
as the case may be.
C. The allocation of costs shall be based on the following standards:
(1) The Township Committee may consider the total cost of the off-site
improvements, the benefits conferred upon the subdivision or
development, the needs created by the subdivision or development,
population and land use projections for the general areas of the
subdivision or development and other areas to be served by the offsite
improvements, and the condition and periods of usefulness,
which periods may be based upon the criteria of the applicable
state statutes.
(2) Road, curb, gutter and sidewalk improvements may be based upon
the anticipated increase of traffic generated by the subdivision or
development of the tract. In determining such traffic increase, the
Township Committee may consider traffic counts, existing and
projected traffic patterns, quality of roads and sidewalks in the
area and other factors related to the need created by the
subdivision or development and the anticipated benefit thereto.
(3) Drainage facilities may be based upon the percentage relationship
between the subdivision acreage or tract being developed, as the
case may be, and the acreage of the total drainage basins involved.
(4) Sewerage facilities may be based upon the proportion that the
subdivision's or development's total anticipated volume of sewage
effluent bears to the existing capacity of existing and proposed
sewage facilities, including but not limited to lines and other
appurtenances leading to and servicing the subdivision or tract
being developed. The Township Committee may also consider types

§ 85-46.1. Transportation Improvement District Plan. [Added
7-22-1985 by Ord. No. 0-85-16; amended 8-10-1987 by Ord. No.
0-87-18]
The following Transportation Improvement District Plan is hereby
established, based upon the circulation element of the Township's Master
Plan:
of effluent and particular problems requiring special equipment or
added costs for treatment.
(5) Water supply and distribution facilities may be based upon the
added facilities required by the total anticipated water use
requirements of the subdivision or tract being developed.
(6) Where an applicant or developer pays the amount determined as
his pro rata share under protest, he shall institute legal action
within one year of such payment in order to preserve the right to a
judicial determination as to the fairness and reasonableness of
such amount.
D. Where the property which is the subject matter of a development
application is located within a designated Transportation Improvement
District, as described in § 85-46.1, the provisions of § 85-46.1 shall be
applied with respect to road improvements in lieu of the provisions of
§ 85-46A through C above. [Added 7-22-1985 by Ord. No. 0-85-16]
A. Transportation Improvement District established. The Transportation
Improvement District (TID) is the area shown and delineated on the
map entitled "Circulation Plan," dated January 1979, revised June 24,
1985, attached hereto and made a part hereof,118 which area contains
properties currently known and designated as "Lots 3.02, 3.03, 3.04
and 1.51 in Block 3," "Lots 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in Block 4," "Lots 6, 7, 8 and 9
in Block 2" and "Lot 65 in Block 5," on the Plainsboro Township Tax Map
(1986).
B. Adjusted impact fee rate. The nature of the improvement covered by
this § 85-46.1 (TID improvement) and the pro rata share of the cost of
such improvement that shall be borne by each developer (as defined in
§ 85-4) with respect to development within the TID is set forth in a
subplan of the Circulation Element of the Township's Master Plan
entitled "Traffic Improvement District Plan" (TID Plan). The TID
improvement covered by the TID Plan is a grade separation of the
intersection of College Road and United States Route 1 in Plainsboro,
New Jersey. The adjusted impact fee rate shall, in accordance with the
TID Plan, be as follows: $3.48 per square foot of gross floor area as
defined in § 101-1 of nonresidential development (basic impact fee
rate), increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the cost estimate
118. Editor's Note: The Circulation Plan is on file in the office of the Township Clerk.
§ 85-46 PLAINSBORO CODE § 85-46.1
82:478
factor set forth in Subsection B(1) below and the price index factor set
forth in Subsection B(2) below.
(1) Cost estimate factor. The basic impact fee rate shall be increased
by $0.0232 per square foot of nonresidential increase development,
for every $100,000 of the estimated cost of the TID improvement
(exclusive of land costs and based on the preliminary, or if then
available, final design thereof) in excess of $15,000,000. The basic
impact fee rate shall be decreased by $0.0232 per square foot of
nonresidential development, for every $100,000 of estimated cost
of the TID improvement (exclusive of land costs and based on the
preliminary, or if then available, final design thereof) below
$15,000,000.
(2) Price index factor. The basic impact fee rate, after adjustment (if
any) made pursuant to Subsection B(1) above to take into account
the cost estimate factor, shall be adjusted by use of the Index, as
defined below, by multiplying such basic impact fee rate by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the index on the date of the
determination of the total impact fee pursuant to § 85-46.1C, and
the denominator of which is the index for 1986 (or if the cost
estimate factor has been utilized, the year in which it was last
utilized). As used herein, the "Index" means the Construction Cost
Index (1967 base year) as published by McGraw Hill Publishers in
the then most recent issue of Engineering News Record and shall
be the average of the Philadelphia area and the New York
Metropolitan area, or if such periodical is no longer published, as
published in another publication of similar reputation and
reliability. If, as of any relevant date, the Index is no longer
published or issued, the Federal Highway Administration's bid
price index or such other index as accurately reflects the effects of
general economic conditions and influences upon the cost of
constructing road improvements in New Jersey shall be used and
employed in the place and stead thereof.
C. Total impact fee. The total impact fee shall be the product of the
Adjusted Impact Fee Rate multiplied by the number of square feet of
gross floor area as defined in § 101-1 included in the development for
which preliminary site plan approval has been received, reduced by the
estimated amount of any improvements which the developer is required
to make to the intersection of College Road and United States Route 1,
except that there shall be no reduction for reasonable at grade
improvements proposed by the developer and approved by the Planning
Board, designed only to accommodate traffic at that intersection on a
temporary, short-term basis until the TID improvement can be
constructed. The total impact fee shall be determined by the Township
Committee as of the time and as a part of the developer's agreement
referred to in § 85-46.1G(2).
D. Payment of total impact fee. Except as otherwise provided in
§ 85-46.1E(4), payment of the total impact fee shall be made as follows:
§ 85-46.1 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 85-46.1
82:479
(1) Full payment. The developer may pay to the Township its total
impact fee upon obtaining its initial building permit for the
development for which preliminary site plan approval has been
received, or
(2) Installments. The developer may pay to the Township the total
impact fee in accordance with the following schedule:
(a) Ten percent of the total impact fee at the issuance of the initial
building permit; and
(b) Ninety percent of the total impact fee at the issuance of
certificate of occupancy for 60% or more of the square footage
of the development.
(c) Prior to payment of the balance of the Total Impact Fee, as
provided in Subsection D(2)(b) above, such balance shall be
readjusted, by use of the Index, by multiplying such balance by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the Index on the date of
the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for 60% or more of
the square footage of the development and the denominator of
which is the Index for the year in which the relevant
developer's agreement was executed.
(3) Phased development. If the development is to be constructed in
phases for which a separate application for final site plan approval
for each phase is to be submitted, the developer may elect to have
the provisions of Subsection D(1) and (2) above applied separately
to each phase of the development. In such event, the total impact
fee shall be allocated among the phases of the development as the
square footage of each phase bears to the total square footage of all
phases of the development (allocated impact fee). The allocated
impact fee for each phase shall be readjusted at the time of the first
payment thereof to reflect any changes in the adjusted impact fee
rate based on the cost estimate factor and/or the price index factor
since the date on which the total impact fee was initially
determined.
(4) Effect of payment. Upon receipt by the Township of the developer's
total impact fee, the developer's responsibility to contribute funds
to the Township for TID improvement shall be deemed satisfied.
E. Form of payment and maintenance thereof.
(1) Payment. Except as provided in Subsection E(4) below, the total
impact fee shall be paid, in accordance with § 85-46.1D, in cash or
certified or bank cashier's check to the Township Treasurer.
(2) Separate escrow account. All payments of the total impact fee shall
be maintained in a separate interest-bearing account credited to
the Township. The amounts escrowed shall be returned to the
developer if they are not expended or obligated for use, as set forth
§ 85-46.1 PLAINSBORO CODE § 85-46.1
82:480
in § 85-46.1F, by the tenth anniversary date of the receipt of such
payment by the Township, together with interest thereon from the
date of such payment. If the TID improvement is completed earlier
than such tenth anniversary date, then the unexpended escrowed
amounts shall be returned to the developer at such earlier date,
together with interest thereon from the date of their payment.
(3) Statement of account. Upon request, the developer shall be given a
statement as to the status of the amounts paid by him.
(4) Contribution in kind. In the event a developer (including, for this
purpose, a partner of a developer) enters into an agreement with
the State of New Jersey, acting through its Department of
Transportation (NJDOT) providing for the design and construction
of the TID improvement (NJDOT) agreement), then completion of
the TID improvement in accordance with the NJDOT agreement
through private construction contracts shall be deemed a
contribution in kind in full satisfaction of all obligations of all
developers under this § 85-46.1, except to the extent that the other
developers shall not have reimbursed fully the developer who
entered into the NJDOT agreement for their respective
proportionate shares of the design and construction costs of the
TID improvement.
F. Use of total impact fee. The Township shall use total impact fees only
for the TID improvement.
G. Total impact fee required.
(1) Preliminary site plan approval. As condition of a preliminary site
plan approval of a development within the TID, the municipal
agency reviewing the application shall require payment of the
developer's total impact fee in accordance with this § 85-46.1.
(2) Final site plan approval. As a condition of final site plan approval of
a development, or phase thereof, within the TID, the municipal
agency reviewing the application shall require the developer to
enter into a developer's agreement with the Township providing for
the payment of the developer's total impact fee in accordance with
this § 85-46-1. Such developer's agreement shall be in a form
approved by the Township Committee. Such agreement shall
either:
(a) Contain provisions concerning the determination of the
developer's total impact fee, the payment an adjustment
thereof, the form of payment and maintenance thereof, the use
of the total impact fee and such other provisions as may be
deemed necessary by the Township Committee, provided that
the same shall be consistent with the provisions of this
§ 85-46.1; or
(b) Provide for a contribution in kind as set forth in § 85-46.1E(4).
§ 85-46.1 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 85-46.1
82:481
H. Land dedication required.
(1) Preliminary site plan approval. As a condition preliminary site plan
approval of a development within TID, the municipal agency
reviewing the application shall require the developer to enter into
an agreement with the Township at the time of final approval to
dedicate such portion of his property as shall be necessary for the
TID improvement. There shall be no reduction in the amount of
square footage of development otherwise permitted on the
developer's property under Chapter 101 by reason of such land
dedication.
(2) Final site plan approval. As a condition of final site plan approval of
a development, or phase thereof, within the TID, the municipal
agency reviewing the application shall require the developer to
enter into an agreement with the Township to dedicate such
portion of his property as shall be necessary for the TID
improvement. Such agreement shall be in a form approved by the
Township Committee.
I. Contributions in excess of developer's total impact fee.
(1) Contributions made in advance of development of developer's own
lands. A developer may elect to pay, in cash or in the form of a
contribution in kind as provided in § 85-46.1E(4), its total impact
fee prior to the development of its property (or portion thereof,
within the TID and the time set forth in § 85-46.1D for the payment
of its total impact fee, in which event the developer's responsibility
to contribute funds to the Township for the TID improvement shall
be deemed satisfied as to such property (or portion thereof). The
developer (including, for this purpose, a partner of the developer)
and Township shall enter into an agreement setting forth the terms
and conditions of such contribution, such agreement shall
recognize that the developer shall be entitled to construct the total
square footage of development upon which its total impact fee was
based subject to compliance with applicable site plan and
subdivision regulations.
(2) Contributions made in advance of development of other developer's
lands. A developer may elect to pay, in cash, or in the form of a
contribution in kind as provided in § 85-46.1E(4), the total impact
fee attributable to property (or portion thereof) of another
developer within the TID, prior to the development of such land and
the time set forth in § 85-46.1D for the payment of such total
impact fee, in which event the developer who made such payment
shall be reimbursed therefor by the Township out of the total
impact fee [adjusted in accordance with § 85-46.1B(1) and (2) to
the date of payment] collected from the other developer in the
future under this § 85-46.1, unless such other developer shall have
theretofore reimbursed fully the developer who made such
payment. The developer (including, for this purpose, a partner of
§ 85-46.1 PLAINSBORO CODE § 85-46.1
82:482
the developer) and Township shall enter into an agreement setting
forth the terms and conditions of such contribution; such
agreement shall recognize that the owner of the property in respect
of which such contribution shall have been made shall be entitled
to construct the total square footage of development upon which
the total impact fee was based subject to compliance with
applicable site plan and subdivision regulations.
J. Effect of transportation district on development applications with prior
approvals. A developer who has obtained preliminary or final approval
with respect to a development located within the TID may choose to be
treated, with respect to such development, in accordance with the
provisions of its approval resolution or, in the alternative, may choose to
be treated in accordance with the provisions of this § 85-46.1.

§ 85-49.1. Recycling system design standards and requirements.
[Added 6-11-2008 by Ord. No. 0-08-10]
A. Any application to the Township of Plainsboro's Planning Board for
subdivision or site plan approval for the construction of multifamily
dwellings of three or more units, single-family developments of 50 or
more units or any commercial, institutional or industrial development
utilizing 1,000 square feet or more of land must include a recycling
plan. At a minimum, the plan must contain the following:
(1) A detailed analysis of the expected composition and amounts of
solid waste and recyclables generated at the proposed
development and the method(s) for removing said items.
(2) The locations where recyclable materials will be deposited. These
locations must provide for convenient recycling opportunities for

§ 85-49.1 PLAINSBORO CODE § 85-53
82:488
shall require, as appropriate, and the Township Committee shall accept,
in accordance with the standards adopted hereinafter:
(1) The furnishing of a performance guarantee in favor of the Township
in an amount not to exceed 120% of the cost of improvements
required by an approval or developer's agreement, ordinance, or
regulation to be dedicated to a public entity, and that have not yet
been installed. The performance guarantee shall also include,
within an approved phase or section of a development, privately
owned perimeter buffer landscaping, as required by local
ordinance or imposed as a condition of approval.
(2) The cost of the performance guarantee shall be determined by the
Township Engineer according to the method of calculation set forth
in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4. At the developer's option, a separate
performance guarantee may be posted for the privately owned
perimeter buffer landscaping. The Township Engineer shall
prepare an itemized cost estimate of the improvements covered by
the performance guarantee, which itemized cost estimate shall be
appended to each performance guarantee posted by the obligor.
(3) The furnishing of a maintenance guarantee in favor of the Township
in an amount not to exceed 15% of the cost of the improvement,
which cost shall be determined by the Township Engineer
according to the method of calculation set forth in N.J.S.A.
40:55D-53.4 for any and all bondable items as permitted therein.
(4) The furnishing of a temporary certificate of occupancy guarantee in
the amount of 120% of the cost of installing the remaining
improvements which are not covered by a performance guarantee
and are required to be completed before the issuance of a
permanent certificate of occupancy. The scope and amount of such
a guarantee will be determined by the Township Engineer.
(5) The furnishing of a safety and stabilization guarantee to return the
property to a safe and stable condition or to otherwise implement
measures to protect the public from access to an unsafe or unstable
condition. The amount of such a guarantee shall be $5,000 where
the overall bonded improvements are $100,000 or less. Where the
overall bonded improvements are $100,000 or more, then the
Township Engineer shall calculate the bond amount in accord with
the following: $5,000 for the first $100,000 of bonded improvement
costs, plus 2.5% of bonded improvement costs in excess of
$100,000 up to $1,000,000, plus 1% of bonded improvement costs
in excess of $1,000,000.
B. Other governmental agencies. In the event that other governmental
agencies or public utilities will automatically own the utilities to be
installed or the improvements are covered by a performance or
maintenance guarantee to another governmental agency, no
§ 85-53 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 85-53
82:489
performance or maintenance guarantee, as the case may be, shall be
required by the Township for such utilities or improvements.
C. Failure to perform; municipal completion. If the required improvements
are not completed or corrected in accordance with the performance
guarantee, the obligor and surety, if any, shall be liable thereon to the
Township for the reasonable cost of the improvements not completed or
corrected, and the Township may either prior to or after the receipt of
the proceeds thereof complete such improvements. Such completion or
correction of improvements shall be subject to the public bidding
requirements of the Local Public Contracts Law, N.J.S.A. 40A:11-1, et
seq.
D. Conformance with municipal standards. All improvements shall be in
accordance with the design standards of the Township Code or as
authorized by a design exception granted by the reviewing board and
shall be subject to inspection and approval by the Municipal Engineer.
The Municipal Engineer shall be notified 24 hours prior to the start of
the various phases of the work, and if discontinued, shall again be
notified when the work will be continued.
E. Release or reduction of performance guarantee.
(1) Upon substantial completion of all required improvements, the
obligor may request of the governing body, in writing, by certified
mail addressed in care of the Township Clerk, that the Township
Engineer prepare, in accordance with the itemized cost estimate
prepared by the Township Engineer and appended to the
performance guarantee pursuant to this chapter, a list of all
uncompleted or unsatisfactorily completed improvements. If such a
request is made, the obligor shall send a copy of the request to the
Township Engineer. The request shall indicate which improvements
have been completed and which improvements remain
uncompleted in the judgment of the obligor. Thereupon the
Township Engineer shall inspect all improvements covered by the
obligor's request and shall file a detailed list and report, in writing,
with the Township Council, and shall simultaneously send a copy
thereof to the obligor not later than 45 days after receipt of the
obligor's request.
(2) The list prepared by the Township Engineer shall state, in detail
with respect to each improvement determined to be incomplete or
unsatisfactory, the nature and extent of the incompleteness of each
incomplete improvement or the nature and extent of, and remedy
for, the unsatisfactory state of each completed improvement
determined to be unsatisfactory. The report prepared by the
Township Engineer shall identify each improvement determined to
be complete and satisfactory together with a recommendation as to
the amount of reduction to be made in the performance guarantee
relating to the completed and satisfactory improvement, in
accordance with the itemized cost estimate prepared by the
§ 85-53 PLAINSBORO CODE § 85-53
82:490
Municipal Engineer and appended to the performance guarantee
pursuant to this chapter.
(3) The Township Committee, by resolution, shall either accept the
improvements determined to be complete and satisfactory by the
Township Engineer, or reject any or all of these improvements upon
the establishment in the resolution of cause for rejection, and shall
approve and authorize the amount of reduction or release to be
made in the performance guarantee relating to the improvements
accepted, in accordance with the itemized cost estimate prepared
by the Township Engineer and appended to the performance
guarantee pursuant to this chapter. This resolution shall be
adopted not later than 45 days after receipt of the list and report
prepared by the Township Engineer. Upon adoption of the
resolution by the Township Committee, the obligor shall be
released from all liability pursuant to its performance guarantee,
with respect to those accepted improvements, except for that
portion sufficient to secure completion or correction of the
improvements not yet accepted; provided, however, that 30% of the
amount of the performance guarantee posted may be retained to
ensure completion and acceptability of all improvements. If any
portion of the required improvements is rejected, the Township
shall require the obligor to complete or correct such
improvements, and, upon completion or correction, the same
procedure of notification, as set forth in this section, shall be
followed.
F. Release or reduction of performance guarantee. The obligor shall
reimburse the Township for all reasonable inspection fees paid to the
Township Engineer for the foregoing inspection of improvements;
provided that the municipality may require of the developer a deposit
for the inspection fees in an amount not to exceed, except for
extraordinary circumstances, the greater of $270 or 5% of the cost of
improvements, which cost shall be determined pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-53.4.
G. Phasing in sections. In the event that final approval is by stages or
sections of development pursuant to Subsection a of Section 29 of P.L.
1975, c. 291 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-38), the provisions of this section shall be
applied by stage or section.
H. Dedication and acceptance. To the extent that any of the improvements
have been dedicated to the Township on the subdivision plat, site plan
and/or zoning permit, the municipality shall be deemed, upon the
release of any performance guarantee required hereunder, to accept
dedication for public use any improvements made thereunder, provided
that such improvements have been inspected and have received final
approval by the Township Engineer.

§ 85-53.1. Deposit with Township; escrow interest. [Added
5-13-1992 by Ord. No. 0-92-05]
Whenever an amount in excess of $5,000 shall be deposited by an applicant
for professional services employed by the Township to review applications
for development, for engineering inspection fees or to satisfy the guarantee
requirements of Section 85-53, the money, until repaid or applied to the
purposes for which it is deposited, including the applicant's portion of the
interest earned thereon, except as otherwise provided in this section, shall
continue to be the property of the applicant and shall be held in trust by
the Township. Money deposited shall be held in escrow. The Township shall
deposit it in a banking institution or savings and loan association in this
state insured by an agency of the federal government, or in any other fund
or depository approved for such deposits by the state, in an account bearing
interest at the minimum rate currently paid by the institution or depository
on time or savings deposits. The Township shall notify the applicant in
writing of the name and address of the institution or depository in which
the deposit is made and the amount of the deposit. The Township shall not
be required to refund an amount of interest paid on a deposit which does
not exceed $100 for the year. If the amount of interest exceeds $100, that
entire amount shall belong to the applicant and shall be refunded to him by
the Township annually or at the time the deposit is repaid or applied to the
purposes for which it was deposited, as the case may be; except that the
Township shall retain for administrative expenses a sum equivalent to 33 1/
3% of the entire amount, which shall be in lieu of all other administrative
and custodial expenses.
§ 85-53.2. Payments to professionals. [Added 5-13-1992 by Ord. No.
0-92-05]
The Township shall make all of the payments to professionals for services
rendered to the Township for review of applications for development, review
and preparation of documents, inspection of improvements or other
purposes under the provisions of the MLUL. If the Township requires of
the developer a deposit toward anticipated municipal expenses for these
professional services, the deposit shall be placed in an escrow account
pursuant to Section 85-5.1. The amount of the deposit required shall be
reasonable in regard to the scale and complexity of the development. All
payments charged to the deposit shall be pursuant to vouchers from the
professionals stating the hours spent, the hourly rate and the expenses
incurred. The Township shall render a written final accounting to the
developer on the uses to which the deposit was put. Thereafter the
Township shall, upon written request, provide copies of the vouchers to the
developer. If the salary, staff support and overhead for a professional are
provided by the municipality, the charge to the deposit shall not exceed
200% of the sum of the products resulting from multiplying (1) the hourly
base salary of each of the professionals by (2) the number of hours spent by
the respective professional on review of the application for development or
the developer's improvements, as the case may be. For other professionals
§ 85-53.1 PLAINSBORO CODE § 85-53.2
82:492
the charge to the deposit shall be at the same rate as all other work of the
same nature by the professional for the municipality.
§ 85-53.3. Maintenance guarantees. [Added 5-13-1992 by Ord. No.
0-92-05]
The Township shall not require that a maintenance guarantee required
pursuant to Section 85-53 be in cash or that more than 10% of a
performance guarantee pursuant to that section be in cash. A developer
may, however, provide at his option some or all of a maintenance guarantee
in cash, or more than 10% of a performance guarantee in cash.
§ 85-53.4. Estimated cost of installation. [Added 5-13-1992 by Ord.
No. 0-92-05]

85-53 shall be estimated by the Township Engineer based on documented
construction costs for public improvements prevailing in the general area of
the Township. The developer may appeal the Township Engineer's estimate
to the Township Committee. The Township Committee shall decide the
appeal within 45 days of receipt of the appeal in writing by the Township
Clerk. After the developer posts a guarantee with the Township based on
the cost of the installation of improvements as determined by the Township
Committee, he may institute legal action within one year of the posting in
order to preserve the right to a judicial determination as to the fairness and
reasonableness of the amount of the guarantee.
§ 85-53.5. Letter of credit. [Added 5-13-1992 by Ord. No. 0-92-05]
The approving authority shall, for the purposes of Section 8553, accept a
performance guarantee or maintenance guarantee which is an irrevocable
letter of credit if it:

ARTICLE XIII
Special Provisions Applicable to Planned Development
[Amended 5-1-1979 by Ord. No. 0-79-8]
§ 85-56.1. Provisions stated.
To encourage and promote flexibility and economy in layout and design
through the use of planned development, the provisions of this article shall
be applicable to planned development and, to the extent provided in this
article, shall constitute special provisions applicable thereto and variations
from the ordinary standards otherwise applicable to subdivisions and site
plans and the approval thereof.
§ 85-56.2. Variations from ordinary standards.
The uniqueness of each proposal for a planned development may require
that the requirements relating to streets and roads, alleys, ways for public
utilities, for parking, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, streetlights, public parks
and playgrounds, school grounds, stormwater drainage, water supply and
distribution, sanitary sewers and sewage collection and treatment shall be
subject to modification from the requirements established in this chapter
and in other Township ordinances. The Planning Board may therefore waive
or modify the requirements otherwise applicable for a particular facility
where the Planning Board finds that such requirements are not necessary in
the interest of the residents, owners, tenants and occupants of the planned
development and their employees and that the waiver or modification of
such requirements is consistent with the interests of the entire Township.
Proposed requirements and standards which are inconsistent with those
required under the prevailing Township ordinances shall be determined
acceptable upon approval by the Planning Board.
§ 85-57. Planned developments.
A. Various types of planned developments listed as conditional uses in
certain districts herein may be permitted by the Planning Board only
after it has determined that the development proposal complies with
the conditions and standards set forth in this section, notwithstanding
other applicable regulations of this article or additional conditions for
the particular planned development.
B. Prior to approval of any planned development, the Planning Board shall
conduct a study as required by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-45, Findings for planned
developments, and reach the following facts and conclusions:
(1) That departures by the proposed development from zoning
regulations otherwise applicable to the subject property
conforming to the zoning standards applicable to the planned
development.
§ 85-56.1 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 85-57
82:497
§ 85-58. Supplemental design criteria for PCD planned unit
developments.
In the review of site plans for a planned residential neighborhood (PCD),
in addition to the site plan criteria established in preceding Articles of this
chapter, the following principles shall also apply:
(2) That the proposals for maintenance and conservation of the
common open space are reliable, and the amount, location and
purpose of the common open space are adequate.
(3) That provision through the physical design of the proposed
development for public services, control over vehicular and
pedestrian traffic and the amenities of light and air, recreation and
visual enjoyment are adequate.
(4) That the proposed planned development will not have an
unreasonably adverse impact upon the area in which it is proposed
to be established.
(5) In the case of a proposed development which contemplates
construction over a period of years, that the terms and conditions
intended to protect the interests of the public and of the residents,
occupants and owners of the proposed development in the total
completion of the development are adequate.
C. To the extent that tentative or conceptual approval or final approval of a
plan of development for a site or portions thereof (including site plans
and subdivision plats) proposed to be developed as a planned
development shall have been granted under the provisions of the PMUD
Ordinance or the PCD Ordinance123 which were in effect prior to the
enactment of this chapter, the developer shall not be obliged to submit
another application for development with respect to matters previously
approved.
D. If the developer of a planned development shall submit an application
for development requesting a substantial variation in the plan of
development for the site being developed as a planned development,
the tentative or conceptual approval with respect to which was granted
prior to the enactment of this chapter pursuant to the provisions of the
PMUD Ordinance or the PCD Ordinance which were in effect prior to
the enactment hereof, then after all required notices of such application
are given and a public hearing on such application is held, the Planning
Board shall make the findings of fact and conclusions set forth above in
this section as to the proposed substantial variation from the tentative
or conceptual approval previously granted in relationship to the entire
plan of development prior to the approval of any such substantial
variation.
123. Editor's Note: See Arts. XI and XII of Ch. 101, Zoning.
§ 85-57 PLAINSBORO CODE § 85-58
82:498
A. Utilities to be constructed within and to serve a PCD shall be
underground.
B. Consideration shall be given to the preservation and conservation of
natural features, including large trees, groves, waterways, aquifer
recharge areas, scenic or historic points or other community assets
within the PCD.
C. All portions of the PCD not to be covered with buildings or other
impermeable surfaces and not to be retained in a natural state shall be
landscaped. The protection of wooded areas, specimen trees of fiveinch
caliper or over, and vegetation suitable for buffer strips within the
development shall be a factor in determining the location of open space,
buildings, underground services, walks, paved areas, playgrounds,
parking areas and finished grade levels.
D. In residential areas, reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except in
cases where proximity to major highways necessitates such location. In
such cases, the lot should normally front on the minor road and be
screened from the major road by suitable planting.
E. The street system may utilize, where proper, culs-de-sac, loop streets
and P-loops and other suitable forms of street layout.
(1) When a cul-de-sac is used in designated residential areas, it shall
be provided with a paved turning circle of sufficient width to
facilitate snow removal and to permit easy access for fire-fighting
equipment and general truck delivery.
(2) The maximum length of a cul-de-sac shall be 600 feet to the turning
circle. This distance may be increased to 800 feet if an emergency
vehicular access and pedestrian walkway of at least 10 feet in
width is provided from the head of a cul-de-sac providing direct
access to the adjacent street.
(3) Any cul-de-sac shall be readily identifiable as such by traffic moving
on the collector street to which it is connected. Culs-de-sac shall
not be located so as to appear to terminate collector streets.
(4) P-loops should have an entrance leg not exceeding 200 feet. The
loop of a P-loop shall have a street length not exceeding 1,000 feet.
F. In any PCD development the street system shall be integrated with the
existing network of streets so that there are at least two points of
access. When a PCD is to be developed in sections, each section shall
provide two points of access, one of which may be temporary and for
emergency access.
G. Pedestrian circulation separated from vehicular circulation should be
encouraged, either in a separate right-of-way or by grass strips,
planting or other protective barriers.
§ 85-58 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 85-59
82:499
§ 85-59. Building site design principles.
In the site Planning and layout of a PCD planned unit development, or
of multifamily and higher density residential sections within the PCD, the
following principles, as appropriate, should be followed:
A. For townhouse-style or similar attached structures, a maximum of 10
dwelling units in a single row with a minimum offset of two to four feet
between every two dwelling units should be encouraged. No more than
six dwelling units should be permitted in a straight line. The planes of
other straight facades should be no more than 80 feet in length without
at least a two-foot offset. Townhouses should be grouped in clusters
(e.g., buildings arranged in a row or L-shaped or U-shaped groupings).
Private parking areas should be located near the entrances and outdoor
living areas or patios adjoining open space or paths leading to open
space. Dwelling units should not front on a through street. Townhouses
and similar-style structures in each cluster should be consistent in
terms of architectural style and major design elements such as
materials, color tones, windows, rooflines and/or roof design.
B. The site plan should be broken into visually small groupings such as
quadrangles, clusters and courts. Devices to slow speed and reduce the
size of each visual grouping, such as garden walls and gates, reduction
in setbacks of facing buildings and variable landscape layout, are
encouraged.
C. No more than five freestanding houses should be placed in a row with
the same setback from a straight street line.
D. Visually repeated elements should be avoided. The use of curved streets
or a variety of architectural design or landscaping to avoid a view of
more than three identical structures from any single point on a street
should be encouraged.
E. Each garden apartment or similar multifamily structure should be
limited to a maximum eight dwelling units per floor or 24 units per
building and a length of 190 feet. Such structures should be grouped in
clusters of consistent architectural design. A minimum of two-foot
building offset should be encouraged for every two ground floor
dwelling units.
F. Special attention shall be given to proper site surface drainage so that
removal of surface waters will not adversely affect neighboring
properties or the public storm drainage system.
G. The size, location, design, color, texture, lighting and materials of all
temporary and permanent signs and outdoor advertising structures or
features shall not detract from the design of proposed buildings and
structures and the surrounding properties.
H. Exposed storage areas, exposed machinery installations, service areas,
truck loading areas, utility buildings and structures and similar
§ 85-59 PLAINSBORO CODE § 85-59
82:500
accessory areas and structures shall be subject to such setbacks,
screen plantings or other screening methods as shall reasonably be
required to prevent their being incongruous with the existing or
contemplated environment and the surrounding properties.
I. Adequate provision shall be made for a sewage disposal system which
shall be of sufficient size, capacity and design to collect and dispose of
all sewage from all present and proposed buildings in the PCD planned
unit development and which shall be otherwise constructed and
maintained in conformity with all applicable state, county and
municipal regulations and requirements.
J. Adequate provision shall be made for a storm drainage and surface
water detention system which shall be of sufficient size, capacity and
design to collect, carry off and dispose of all predictable surface water
runoff within the PCD planned unit development and which shall be
otherwise constructed and maintained in conformity with all applicable
state, county and municipal regulations and requirements.
K. Adequate provision shall be made for a water system which shall be of
sufficient size, capacity and design to supply potable water and fire
protection to each of the buildings within the PCD planned unit
development and which shall be otherwise constructed and maintained
in conformity with all applicable state, county and municipal
regulations and requirements.
L. Adequate provision shall be made for the collection and disposal and,
where possible, recycling of garbage, trash and solid waste generated
by the PCD planned unit development, and such system shall be
maintained in conformity with all applicable state, county and
municipal regulations and requirements.
M. In the event that the PCD planned unit development is to be
constructed in sections over a period of years, then the provisions for
the sewage and garbage disposal, storm drainage and water supply and
for interior roads, specified in Subsections I, J, K, L and M of this
section, need to be adequate only in respect to the sections of
development which have previously received final approval and the
section of development for which final approval is being sought. The
developer shall supply to the Planning Board information disclosing
such adequacy and obtain the Planning Board's approval thereof.
N. Except as otherwise provided in this section, there shall be no minimum
lot area, width or frontage, no minimum building setback, no maximum
percentage of lot coverage, no requirement as to front, side or rear
yards and no requirement concerning the location of accessory
buildings or structures for any land use in a PCD planned unit
development. However, no plan for a PCD planned unit development
shall be approved unless the lot areas, widths, depths and frontages,
building setbacks, percentages of lot coverage, front, side and rear
yards and locations of accessory buildings or structures provided for in
§ 85-59 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 85-59

§ 85-60. Off-street parking.
§ 85-61. Minimum spacing between buildings.
the site plan and subdivision plan are consonant with the public health,
safety and general welfare, nor shall regulations otherwise applicable
to temporary or permanent signs, except as indicated below, apply
to such signs relating to uses permitted in a PCD planned unit
development; the standards applicable to such signs set forth in
subsection G of this section shall, however, be observed. Temporary
signs erected to advertise the sale or lease of any structure in
nonresidential use or any portion thereof shall comply with the
requirements set forth in § 101-157B(6) of this chapter. [Amended
12-12-2007 by Ord. No. 0-07-24]
O. No building or structure, other than entrance gatehouses, walls, fences,
carports or signs, shall be located within 50 feet of any exterior
boundary line of the PCD planned unit development.
A. The minimum number of parking spaces for uses permitted in a PCD
planned unit development shall be 1.25 spaces for a one-bedroom unit,
1.75 spaces for a two-bedroom unit and two spaces for a three-bedroom
unit or fraction thereof.
B. Off-street parking spaces and parking area access aisles shall be
dimensioned in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 85,
Subdivision and Site Plan Review, § 85-44B. [Amended 9-11-2002 by
Ord. No. 0-02-15]
A. Except as otherwise provided in Subsection B of this section, in a PCD
Planned unit development, in order to provide for privacy, daylight
needs and orientation, proper spacing and building relationships should
be maintained between similar structures, except single-family houses,
in development groups of more than one building or structure on a
tract. These guidelines shall not be regarded as inflexible nor shall they
be applied in a manner that will adversely affect full implementation of
a plan of development, including any amended plan that has or shall
hereafter receive conceptual approval. However, the attainment of
these guidelines shall not be considered justification for building
placement and proper site plan design without other considerations set
forth in this chapter. The following distances should be encouraged:
(1) End wall to end wall: 1/2 the height of the highest wall (12 feet
minimum).
(2) Any building face to street curb: the height of the highest wall (20
feet minimum).
(3) Any building face to parking area: 1/2 the height of the highest wall
(12 feet minimum).
§ 85-59 PLAINSBORO CODE § 85-61
82:502
§ 85-62. Common open space and recreation.
(4) End wall to window wall: 1 1/2 the height of the highest wall (30
feet minimum).
(5) Window wall to window wall: three times the height of the highest
wall (75 feet minimum).
B. Where buildings of different types will be developed as a single
development group, such as single-family and townhouses or
residential and nonresidential uses, an appropriate buffer shall be used.
This may include fencing, facing similar uses with each other, natural
areas, parks or recreation facilities, or uses providing gradual density
changes between the two dissimilar uses. Actual building spacing
between the two types of uses may be equal to the actual height of the
lower density use times the difference in the net density of the two uses.
A minimum of 125 feet may be provided if a minimum twenty-five-foot
planted landscape buffer is included within the minimum spacing
between buildings.
C. The provisions of Subsection B above shall not apply to any
development for which a plan of development shall have been granted
conceptual approval under the former provisions of the PCD Ordinance
in effect at the time of such approval or to any development with
respect to which an application for amendment of the conceptual plan
of development (including expansion of the site proposed to be
developed as a PCD planned unit development) has been made prior to
the enactment of this article.124
A. General requirements.
(1) In the designation of common open space areas, consideration shall
be given to providing for continuity of open space between sections
of a development and between open space within a development
and open space on adjacent lands. Open space shall be so
distributed throughout the development that there is a hierarchy of
activities from preservation areas to passive open space adjacent
and between each residential cluster. Designating all open space in
one portion of a development is to be discouraged.
(2) In a PCD planned unit development, usable recreation space should
be provided for active recreation within 1/4 mile of all units. Part of
this may be a lake or a pond having a substantially constant water
level, but excluding therefrom detention and retention basins. Any
larger preservation spaces shall still be contiguous to and directly
related to dwelling structures. Usable recreation space may be
improved with facilities for swimming pools, tot lots, playgrounds
and quiet outdoor sports such as, but not limited to, tennis, paddle
124. Editor's Note: The term "Article" refers to Ord. No. 0-78-8, adopted 5-1-1979.
§ 85-61 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 85-62
82:503
tennis, golf, baseball, basketball, soccer, lacrosse and the like, and
accessory buildings such as clubhouses and pavilions.
(3) Passive recreational facilities shall be carefully oriented.
(4) The common open space shall be set aside for the use and benefit of
the owners, residents and occupants of the planned development.
B. Open space design standards. The following recreational facilities
should be considered as part of any, but not necessarily all, PCD
planned unit developments:
(1) Trails and bikeways used to connect open space between
recreational facilities and between buildings and other uses.
(2) Playlots, with a minimum of 2,000 square feet for toddlers and up
to 5,000 square feet for older children, primarily used by preschoolaged
children. Facilities shall include swings, slides, play
sculptures and benches for parents. The effective service radius of
one lot shall be 1/8 to 1/4 of a mile. There shall be approximately
one playlot for each 400 persons or 100 children.
(3) Playgrounds, designed for a variety of uses, with equipment to
reflect the patronage: sandboxes and play sculpture for young
children, basketball courts or backboards for older youths, paved
areas for various activities and shuffleboard and sunny and quiet
areas for the elderly. The size of playgrounds should be based on
population as follows:
Population
Size
(acres)
2,000 3.75
3,000 4.0
4,000 5.0
5,000 6.0
(4) Tennis. There should be one court for each 100 dwelling units.
Parking should be provided on the basis of four per court.
(5) Swimming pools. Three square feet of pool area for each resident
above three years of age should be provided. Wading pools should
be provided.
C. Dedication to public use. Land located within a planned development
may, subject to the approval of the Planning Board, be dedicated to
public use, and the Township of Plainsboro or other governmental
agency may at any time or from time to time accept the dedication
thereof or any interest therein for public use and maintenance. Land
dedicated for public use and maintenance for recreational or
conservational purposes shall be deemed land devoted to common open
§ 85-62 PLAINSBORO CODE § 85-62
82:504
space for the purpose of satisfying the requirements set forth in
Chapter 101, Zoning, §§ 101-140A and B and 101-130. Nothing herein
contained, however, shall be deemed to be a requirement, as a
condition of the approval of a planned development, that land proposed
to be set aside for common open space be dedicated or made available
to public use.
D. Ownership and maintenance.
(1) The developer shall provide for an organization for the ownership
and maintenance of any common open space for the benefit of
owners, residents and occupants of the planned development if
said common open space is not dedicated to the Township of
Plainsboro or other governmental agency. The developer may
comprise such organization. Any such organization shall not be
dissolved and shall not dispose of any common open space, by sale
or otherwise, except to an organization conceived and established
to own and maintain the common open space for the benefit of such
development, and thereafter such organization shall not be
dissolved or dispose of any of its common open space without first
offering to dedicate the same to the Township of Plainsboro.
(2) In the event that such organization shall fail to maintain the
common open space in reasonable order and condition, the
Township Committee of the Township of Plainsboro may serve
written notice upon such organization or upon the owners of the
planned development, setting forth the manner in which the
organization has failed to maintain the common open space in
reasonable condition, and said notice shall include a demand that
such deficiencies of maintenance be cured within 35 days thereof
and shall state the date and place of a hearing thereon, which shall
be held within 15 days of the notice. At such hearing, the Township
Committee may modify the terms of the original notice as to
deficiencies and may give a reasonable extension of time, not to
exceed 65 days, within which they shall be cured. If the deficiencies
set forth in the original notice or in the modification thereof shall
not be cured within said 35 days or any permitted extension
thereof, the Township of Plainsboro, in order to preserve the
common open space and maintain the same for a period of one year,
may enter upon and maintain such land. Said entry and
maintenance shall not vest in the public any rights to use the
common open space except when the same is voluntarily dedicated
to the public by the owners. Before the expiration of said year, the
Township Committee shall, upon its initiative or upon the request of
the organization theretofore responsible for the maintenance of the
common open space, call a public hearing upon 15 days' written
notice to such organization and the the owners of the planned
development, to be held by the Township Committee, at which
hearing such organization and the owners of the planned
development shall show cause why such maintenance by the
§ 85-62 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 85-62
82:505
§ 85-63. Obligation of successive owners in planned developments.
In the event of any proposed conveyance or transfer of fee simple ownership
of a substantial portion of planned development property, excluding the
transfer of fee simple ownership of individual dwelling units, the Planning
Board shall be given notice of such intended conveyance or transfer prior
to any actual transference thereof. Such notice shall be accompanied by the
following information:
Township of Plainsboro shall not, at the election of the Township
of Plainsboro, continue for a succeeding year. If the Township
Committee shall determine that such organization is ready and able
to maintain said common open space in reasonable condition, the
Township of Plainsboro shall cease to maintain said common open
space at the end of said year. If the Township Committee shall
determine such organization is not ready and able to maintain said
common open space in a reasonable condition, the Township of
Plainsboro may, in its discretion, continue to maintain said common
open space during the next succeeding year, subject to a similar
hearing and determination in each year thereafter. The decision of
the Township Committee in any such case shall constitute a final
administrative decision subject to judicial review.
(3) The cost of such maintenance by the Township of Plainsboro shall
be assessed pro rata against the properties within the planned
development that have a right to enjoyment of the common open
space in accordance with assessed value at the time of imposition
of the lien, and such cost shall become a lien and tax on said
properties and be added to and be a part of the taxes to be levied
and assessed thereon and enforced and collected with interest by
the same officers and in the same manner as other taxes.
E. Timing of open space development. Al proposed improvements of the
common open space in a PCD planned unit development, as indicated
on the final plan of a development application, including recreational
facilities, buildings and landscaping, shall be completed before more
than 25% of the certificates of occupancy will be granted. In the case of
a development staged over time utilizing common open space areas, the
extent of completion of such areas shall be calculated on a proration of
extent of completed residential units to total residential units proposed
for the planned development. Where development is primarily
nonresidential in nature, the proration shall be calculated on the extent
of nonresidential building square footage to total nonresidential square
footage proposed for the development. This ratio shall be applied
against the total common open space and attendant facilities and
buildings and a determination shall be made by the Construction
Official as to the extent of common open space improvements
completed.
A. A precise description of the interest being transferred.
§ 85-62 PLAINSBORO CODE § 85-63
82:506
§ 85-63.1. Evaluation standards and criteria.
In reviewing all site plans and subdivision plats relating to a PMUD planned
unit development, the Planning Board shall use the standards and criteria
set forth in § 101-141 of the Zoning Ordinance.125 The provisions set forth
in §§ 85-58 through 85-61 and § 85-62A, B and E shall not apply to a PMUD
planned unit development.
§ 85-63.2. Development in sections.
The developer may submit to the Planning Board subdivision plats and
site plans for approval of one or more portions or sections of the planned
development proposed to be developed, any one or more of which may be
a single lot. There may be a requirement that some nonresidential uses
be built before, after or at the same time as the residential uses, or a
requirement of timing of development among the various types of uses
permitted in a planned development and the subgroups thereunder. The
Planning Board may allow for a greater concentration of density or intensity
of land use within a section or sections of the planned development,
whether it be earlier, later or simultaneous in the development, than in
other section or sections.
§ 85-63.3. Minimal deviations.
The Planning Board may permit minimal deviations from the conditions
of preliminary approval previously granted to applications for approval
of subdivision plats and site plans of a section or sections of a planned
development necessitated by change of conditions beyond the control of the
developer since the date of preliminary approval without the developer's
being required to submit another application for preliminary approval of
such subdivision plats and site plans.
B. The obligations to be assumed by the transferee.
C. An agreement that the transferee agrees to be bound by all of the
applicable provisions of prior Planning Board approvals.

§ 85-70.6. Modification of proposed schedule.
In the event that the developer seeks to modify the proposed timing
schedule, such modification shall require the approval of the Planning
Board. The Planning Board shall, in deciding whether or not to grant
approval of the modification, take into consideration prevailing economic
and market conditions, anticipated and actual needs for residential units
and nonresidential space within the Township and the region, and the
availability and capacity of public facilities to accommodate the proposed
development.
the community and non-property tax revenues for the municipality
and school district. Such cost and benefit analysis shall discuss
the revenues expected to be generated from the development
compared to the anticipated costs which the proposed development
is expected to generate. Revenues and costs shall be shown for the
municipality, the school system, and the county.
K. A proposed timing schedule in the case of a planned development

pursuant thereto after the effective date of the approval.
B. The term of the effect of the general development plan approval shall be
determined by the Planning Board using the guidelines set forth in
Subsection C. of this section, except that the term of the effect of the
approval shall not exceed 20 years from the date upon which the
developer received final approval of the first section of the planned
development.
C. In making its determination regarding the duration of the effect of
approval of the general development plan, the Planning Board shall
consider: the number of dwelling units or amount of nonresidential
floor area to be constructed; prevailing economic conditions; the timing
schedule to be followed in completing the development and the
likelihood of its fulfillment; the developer's capability of completing the
proposed development; and the contents of the general development
plan and any conditions which the Planning Board attaches to the
approval thereof.

§ 85-70.7. Variations in location of land uses or increase in density
or floor area ratio.
The developer shall be required to gain the prior approval of the Planning
Board if, after approval of the general development plan, the developer
wishes to make any variation in the location of land uses within the planned
development or to increase the density of residential development or the
floor area ratio of nonresidential development in any section of the planned
development.
§ 85-70.8. Amendment or revision of general development plan;
allowable reductions within original approval.
§ 85-70.9. Notice of completion of section of development; notice by
municipality of nonfulfillment; hearing, termination of approval;
causes.
A. Except as provided hereunder, once a general development plan has
been approved by the Planning Board, it may be amended or revised
only upon application by the developer approved by the Planning Board.
B. A developer, without violating the terms of the approval pursuant to
General Development Plan Ordinance of the Township of Plainsboro,
may, in undertaking any section of the planned development, reduce the
number of residential units or amounts of nonresidential floor space by
no more than 15% or reduce the residential density or nonresidential
floor area ratio by no more than 15%.
A. Upon completion of each section of the development as set forth in the
approved general development plan, the developer shall notify the
administrative officer, by certified mail, as evidence that the developer
is fulfilling his obligations under the approved plan. For the purposes of
this section, "completion" of any section of the development shall mean
that the developer has acquired a certificate of occupancy for every
residential unit or every nonresidential structure, as set forth in the
approved general development plan and pursuant to section 15 of the
State Uniform Construction Code (C. 52:57D-133). If the Township does
not receive such notification at the completion of any section of the
development, the Township shall notify the developer, by certified mail,
in order to determine whether or not the terms of the approved plan are
being complied with.
B. If a developer does not complete any section of the development within
eight months of the date provided for in the approved plan, or if at any
time the Township has cause to believe that the developer is not
fulfilling his obligations pursuant to the approved plan, the Township
shall notify the developer, by certified mail, and the developer shall
have 10 days within which to give evidence that he is fulfilling his

observed as elsewhere required in this chapter. However, the provisions
of this section shall not apply so as to reduce the buildable width to less
than 50% of any lot less than 100 feet in width, although in no case shall
any structure be erected closer to any street line than 25 feet. No such
setback need exceed a distance of 50 feet. Corner lots having frontages
of greater than 100 feet on both intersecting streets shall observe the
same requirements for front yards on both streets as apply to adjoining
interior lots facing upon such streets.
B. Where the above requirements impose greater restrictions upon the
location of accessory buildings than any requirements elsewhere in this
chapter, the above shall apply to necessary buildings as well.

[Amended 10-10-2018 by Ord. No. 18-13]
I. Buildings, structures and uses owned and operated by the Township of
Plainsboro.
J. Rural residential planned village clusters, subject to the following
requirements and conforming to the findings of a planned development
as defined by the Municipal Land Use law, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-45, and in
accordance with an approved general development plan.
(1) The minimum total area to be developed as a rural village cluster
shall be 150 acres. Such area shall be developed in accordance
with a single comprehensive general development plan. Streets
shall not be deemed to divide acreage for the purposes of this
requirement [Amended 8-14-1991 by Ord. No. 0-91-31]
(2) For rural village cluster developments located in the R-100 Zoning
District, the maximum number of permitted lots shall be
determined by multiplying the net developable acreage of a tract,
after exclusion of environmentally constrained areas and public
rights-of-way, by 0.3 dwelling units per acre and multiplying the net
acreage of environmentally constrained areas and public rights-of-
152. Editor's Note: This ordinance also provided for the renumbering of former §§ 101-15
through 101-21 as §§ 102-25 through 101-31, respectively.

way by 0.166 dwelling units per acre and adding the resultant
figures to establish the maximum number of lots. Environmentally
constrained areas shall include areas designated as wetlands, onehundred-
year flood hazard areas, water bodies and public rightsof-
way. Detailed soil engineering and geotechnical test data
undertaken in accordance with acceptable engineering standards
and practices may be submitted by an applicant if he seeks
amendment of the boundary limits established by state and federal
regulatory agencies which define such environmentally
constrained areas.
(a) The number of cluster residential lots may be increased above
the number otherwise permitted hereunder where the Board
finds that the application therefor advances the purposes of the
Master Plan and finds that the following standards have been
established by the proofs presented in support of an
application for such additional residential lots in which the
additional density is proposed to be transferred from a
noncontiguous property or properties: [Added 9-24-1997 by
Ord. No. 0-97-18]
[1] The development tract (receiving tract) on which the
cluster development is proposed shall be joined in a single
application for development, together with the
preservation tract (sending tract).
[2] The sending tract shall be located in the R-350 Low-
Density Residential Light-Impact Zone.
[3] The number of additional permitted cluster residential lots
shall be no more than 20% greater than the number of
cluster lots otherwise allowed on the receiving tract
regardless of the theoretical or previously agreed to yield
with respect to the sending tract. However, if the
theoretical or previously agreed to yield of the sending
tract is a number of lots that is less than 20% more than
the number of cluster residential lots otherwise allowed on
the receiving tract, then the additional lots transferred to
the receiving tract shall not exceed that theoretical yield
with respect to the sending tract.
[4] The Township Committee has agreed to accept and an
applicant is willing to dedicate, in fee, the sending tract, or
portion thereof, for preservation or other municipal
purpose consistent with the Master Plan.
[5] For the purpose of calculation of required agricultural,
conservation, open space and/or recreational area within
the receiving rural village cluster, as required in
Subsection J(3) below, the total land area and proposed
§ 101-15 PLAINSBORO CODE § 101-15
94:630
uses of both the sending and receiving tracts shall be
considered.
(3) No less than 75% of a rural village cluster development shall be
devoted to agricultural, conservation, open space and/or
recreational purposes. All one-hundred-year flood hazard areas and
wetlands shall be permanently restricted for open space. Individual
residential lots or portions thereof shall not be construed as open
space. Designated agricultural, conservation, open space and/or
recreational areas shall be in major contiguous parcels and shall be
interconnected with similar areas on abutting tracts and parcels,
having adequate access to public and/or private roads and in some
cases consisting of land developed for specific recreational
purposes. Conservation, open space and/or recreational areas shall
also be interspersed within the village cluster development. Open
space may be used for sewage disposal systems using techniques
conforming to applicable environmental and engineering
standards. Open space areas, for purposes of this requirement,
shall not include, among other things, courtyards, cul-de-sac
islands and miniparks.
(4) All dwelling units associated with rural village clusters shall be
required to locate within housing areas identified on the Plainsboro
Township Land Use Map.
(5) Recreational facilities and open space.
(a) Active recreational facilities may be provided in a rural village
cluster development subject to the review and approval of the
Planning Board. Such recreational facilities may be jointly
provided by two or more developers within the R-100 Zone
with convenient access to all users, provided that the facility
and/or recreational area shall equal the recreational
requirements of the participating properties served. The
location of such recreational facilities shall be carefully
planned to provide privacy for the users and to avoid problems
of noise, lighting and similar nuisances which might interfere
with their use and enjoyment by residents of the development.
(b) The design and use of open space areas interspersed among
groupings of residential dwellings shall protect the natural
resources and qualities of the site, including the natural
terrain, woodlands, significant views and any unique and
unusual features. Open space other than that preserved for its
natural values shall be suitably landscaped. All structures
within open space areas shall be sited so as to retain their
visual appeal. The Planning Board shall require such grading,
drainage, planting, walkways, fencing, lighting and such other
improvements in the common open space as may be necessary
to enhance the intended open space and recreational uses.
§ 101-15 TREES AND SHRUBS § 101-15
94:631
(6) To the maximum extent practicable, rural village clusters shall be
located on land not well suited for agricultural purposes because of
size, location, proximity to neighboring land uses, existing tree
mass, access, shape, quality of soil and drainage. The design and
location of rural village clusters shall give priority to protecting the
most suitable soils for subsurface septic disposal (in unsewered
areas only); to leaving prime agricultural soils for agricultural uses,
to avoiding environmentally constrained areas; to locating
dwellings along wooded areas to reduce impacts upon agriculture,
to provide summer shade and shelter from winter wind and to
enable new residential construction to be visually absorbed by
natural landscape features; to not blocking or interrupting scenic
vistas, as seen from the public roadways; and to locating dwelling
units and other improvements on the lower-quality agricultural
soils.
(7) The Planning Board shall permit the subdivision of all existing (at
the time of ordinance adoption) single-family detached dwelling
units with accessory uses and/or farm buildings to be located on a
minimum lot size of one acre as part of the comprehensive
development plan for the village cluster development.
(8) The applicant for a rural village cluster development shall execute
such statement for prospective homeowners as the Planning Board
requires which recognizes that the applicant is aware of the
purposes and requirements governing the R-100 Zone; and that the
applicant and prospective homeowners are aware that certain
disturbances and annoyances arising from usual commercial
agricultural activities can reasonably be expected to occur
seasonally, both during the day and night; and that, in
consideration for being granted the right to construct or occupy a
nonfarm single-family dwelling in the zone, the applicant hereby
waives, on behalf of himself, his heirs, successors and assigns, all
right to object to such reasonable commercial agricultural
activities.
(9) When the major purpose of the rural village cluster is to preserve
open space for agricultural and farming purposes, all dwelling
units shall be located and constructed at such places on the tract
and in such a manner that, to the greatest extent possible, they
shall not segment land of any one farm into awkward or odd-shaped
parcel sizes difficult to support viable farming operations, nor
interfere with the conduct of agriculture, on- or off-site, by limiting
or interfering with the access to fields or the effectiveness and
efficiency of the farmer and farm equipment, including cropspraying
aircraft.
(10) The following minimum design, bulk and area requirements shall
apply to the development of a rural village cluster:
§ 101-15 PLAINSBORO CODE § 101-15
94:632
(a) The Planning Board shall determine the total number and
location of clusters at the time of general development plan
review.
(b) Land used for agricultural use shall be provided access for
farm equipment that does not interfere with rural village
cluster vehicular access.
(c) A development tract's existing road frontage shall not be
totally subdivided into residential lots.
(d) Impervious surfaces, in the aggregate, shall not cover more
than 40% of the net residential land (as defined above) of the
tract.
(e) All residential lots shall be serviced by a public centralized
water system and either a public sewer, community septic
system or individual septic systems upon demonstration that
such individual systems are permitted under state law and
New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection policy.
(f) No habitable dwelling unit area shall be constructed below
grade if the Township Engineer determines that water
problems will result from existing soil limitations. Units shall
be designed in such a manner as to provide maximum security
and visual privacy from adjacent units.
(g) Twenty thousand square feet shall be the minimum lot area for
a residential lot. The average lot area, including one dwelling,
its accessory uses and private open space, shall not be less
than 25,000 square feet.
[1] Frontage. The minimum street frontage shall be 125 feet.
[2] Lot width. The minimum lot width shall be 125 feet.
[3] Lot depth. The minimum lot depth shall be 150 feet.
[4] Front yard. The minimum front yard depth shall be 50 feet.
[5] Side yard. The minimum side yard width shall be 20 feet.
[6] Rear yard. The minimum rear yard depth shall be 30 feet.
[7] Building height. The maximum building height shall be 35
feet.
(h) The minimum lot frontage shall not be less than specified
above unless a lot adjoins a cul-de-sac or is on a curved

the minimum lot width shall be measured at the front setback
line.
§ 101-15 TREES AND SHRUBS § 101-15
94:633
(i) New streets shall be constructed to service rural village cluster
developments instead of subdividing new lots along existing
minor arterial, major collector and minor collector roadways
within the R-100 Zone. In a subdivision abutting arterial or
collector roadways, the frontage shall be reversed so that the
lots contiguous to such streets will front on the newly-created
collectors, local streets or cul-de-sacs, with an additional lot
depth of 50 feet over and above bulk and area regulations. This
additional lot depth shall be a conservation easement used
exclusively for planting, screening, and landscaped earthen
berms to be provided by the developer and maintained by the
lot owner or by a homeowners' association, if one is created.
(11) Land permanently set aside for agricultural, conservation, open
space and/or recreational uses may either be offered for dedication
to Plainsboro Township, deed-restricted to remain with the original
property owner, dedicated to a nonprofit organization found
acceptable to the Township Planning Board and/or protected by a
homeowners' community association. An open space which is not
accepted for public use by the Township Committee shall be
protected by legal arrangements satisfactory to the Planning
Board, sufficient to assure its maintenance and preservation in
perpetuity for its intended purpose. Covenants or other legal
arrangements shall specify ownership of the open space; method of
maintenance; responsibility for maintenance; maintenance taxes
and insurance; compulsory assessment provisions; guaranties that
any homeowners' association formed to own and maintain open
space will not be dissolved without the consent of the Planning
Board; and any other specifications deemed necessary by the
Planning Board. The open space left unbuilt upon after
development shall be maintained in accordance with a land
management plan prepared by the developer and accepted and
approved by the Planning Board. The developer shall provide
copies of deed covenants with prospective purchases, or
conservation easements with the Township, describing land
management practices to be followed by the party or parties that
are responsible for open space. Further subdivision of open space
land, or its use for other than agriculture, conservation and
recreation, shall be prohibited.
(12)Within open space areas, the Planning Board may require the
developer to make certain site preparation improvements, which
may include, but are not limited to the following:
(a) Removal of dead or diseased trees.
(b) Thinning of trees or other growth to encourage more desirable
growth.
(c) Removal of trees in areas planned for ponds, lakes or active
recreational facilities.
§ 101-15 PLAINSBORO CODE § 101-15
94:634
(d) Grading and seeding.
(e) Improvement or protection of the natural drainage system
through the use of protective structures, stabilization
measures and similar improvements.
(f) Improvement and landscaping of ponds and lakes to afford
appropriate use and enjoyment by the residents.
(13) Notwithstanding anything in Subsection J(11) hereof to the
contrary, land designated as agricultural, conservation or open
space may be incorporated into private lots which conform to this
chapter upon approval by the Planning Board that such land will be
permanently protected from development as an alternative to
dedication or protection by a homeowners' community association.
(14) Buffer areas.
(a) Any rural village cluster development shall be buffered from
adjoining agricultural lands to create an effective dense barrier
separating yards and fields and pastures, to ensure that the
continuation of agricultural operations in the area will not be
impaired by nuisance complaints. The buffer shall, inasmuch as
possible, be a natural one. The dimensions of the buffer area
and its treatment with landscaping, natural berms and/or
fencing shall be subject to review and approval by the Planning
Board.
(b) Additionally, there shall be a buffer area separating the village
cluster from adjacent streets and residential areas. The
dimensions of the buffer area and its treatment with
landscaping, berms or fencing shall be subject to review and
approval by the Planning Board. However, as a minimum, the
buffer area, along all lot and street lines, shall be 50 feet wide.
(15)No preliminary approval shall be granted for any subdivision or site
plan in connection with the development of a rural village cluster
unless the Township Health Officer and Township Engineer have
approved plans for potable water supply and sewage disposal to
serve the development
(16) All historic buildings, as identified on the Middlesex County
Inventory of Historic, Cultural and Architectural Resources,
located within a rural village cluster development shall be
permanently protected and reused by the developer, to the extent
feasible, in conformance with requirements received from the
Planning Board.
(17) Flexibility and variety in lot and building layout, roadway
construction, utility design and other site improvements shall be
encouraged to best relate the improvements to the land. To that
end, lots, buildings and utilities shall be designed so as to minimize
§ 101-15 TREES AND SHRUBS § 101-15
94:635
the alteration of the natural terrain and fit into the rural,
agricultural and open space environment of the R-100 Zone.

§ 101-17 TREES AND SHRUBS § 101-17
94:643
The design and location of residential clusters shall give priority
to protecting the most suitable soils for subsurface septic disposal
(in unsewered areas only); to leaving prime agricultural soils for
agricultural uses; to avoiding environmentally constrained areas;
to locating dwellings along wooded areas to reduce impacts upon
agriculture, to provide summer shade and shelter from winter wind
and to enable new residential construction to be visually absorbed
by natural landscape features; to not blocking or interrupting
scenic vistas, as seen from the public roadways, and to locating
dwelling units and other improvements on the lower-quality
agricultural soils.
(5) The Planning Board shall permit the subdivision of all existing
single-family detached dwelling units with accessory uses and/or
farm buildings to be located on a minimum lot size of one acre as
part of the comprehensive development plan for the cluster
development at the time of ordinance adoption.
(6) The applicant for a cluster development shall execute such
statement for prospective homeowners as the Planning Board
requires which recognizes that the applicant is aware of the
purposes and requirements governing the R-100 Zone; that the
applicant and prospective homeowners are aware that certain
disturbances and annoyances arising from usual commercial
agricultural activities can reasonably be expected to occur
seasonally, both during the day and night; and that, in
consideration for being granted the right to construct or occupy a
nonfarm single-family dwelling in the zone, the applicant hereby
waives, on behalf of himself, his heirs, successors and assigns, all
right to object to such reasonable commercial agricultural
activities.
(7) When the major purpose of the rural village cluster is to preserve
open space for agricultural and farming purposes, all dwelling
units shall be located and constructed at such places on the tract
and in such a manner that, to the greatest extent possible, they
shall not segment land of any one farm into awkward or odd-shaped
parcel sizes difficult to support viable farming operations, nor
interfere with the conduct of agriculture, on- or off-site, by limiting
or interfering with the access to fields or the effectiveness and
efficiency of the farmer and farm equipment, including cropspraying
aircraft.
(8) The following minimum design, bulk and area requirements shall
apply to the development of a cluster:
(a) The Planning Board shall determine the total number and

water system or private wells and either a public sewer,
community septic system or individual septic systems upon
demonstration that such individual systems are permitted
under state law and New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection policy.
(f) No habitable dwelling unit area shall be constructed below
grade if the Township Engineer determines that water
problems will result from existing soil limitations. Units shall
be designed in such a manner as to provide maximum security
and visual privacy from adjacent units.
(g) If lots are clustered, they shall be subject to the criteria set
forth below:
[1] Lot area. The minimum lot area shall be one acre.
[2] Frontage and lot width. The minimum street frontage and
lot width shall be 170 feet.
[3] Lot depth. The minimum lot depth shall be 150 feet.
[4] Front yard. The minimum front yard depth shall be 50 feet.

roadway alignment or is otherwise odd-shaped, in which case
the minimum lot width shall be measured at the front setback
line.
(i) New streets shall be constructed to service cluster
developments instead of subdividing new lots along existing
minor arterial, major collector and minor collector roadways
within the R-100 Zone. In a subdivision abutting arterial or
collector roadways, the frontage shall be reversed so that the
§ 101-17 TREES AND SHRUBS § 101-17
94:645
lots contiguous to such streets will front on the newly created
collectors, local streets or cul-de-sacs, with an additional lot
depth of 50 feet over and above bulk and area regulations.
This additional lot depth shall be a conservation easement used
exclusively for planting, screening and landscaped earthen
berms to be provided by the developer and maintained by the
lot owner or by a homeowners' association, if one is created.
(9) During site plan and subdivision review, the following criteria shall
be addressed to the satisfaction of the Planning Board:
(a) Consistency with the Township Subdivision and Site Plan
Review Regulations,159 except as modified herein.
(b) The function and visual relationship between the cluster
development and adjacent developments.

space and/or recreational uses may either be offered for dedication
to Plainsboro Township, deed-restricted to remain with the original
property owner, dedicated to a nonprofit organization found
acceptable to the Township Planning Board and/or protected by a
homeowners' community association. An open space which is not
accepted for public use by the Township Committee shall be
protected by legal arrangements satisfactory to the Planning Board
sufficient to assure its maintenance and preservation in perpetuity
for agricultural, conservation, open space and/or recreational uses
as directed by the Planning Board. Covenants or other legal
arrangements shall specify ownership of the open space; method of
maintenance; responsibility for maintenance; maintenance taxes
and insurance; compulsory assessment provisions; guaranties that
any homeowners' association formed to own and maintain open
space will not be dissolved without the consent of the Planning
Board; and any other specifications deemed necessary by the
Planning Board. The open space left unbuilt upon after
development shall be maintained in accordance with a land
management plan prepared by the developer and accepted and
159. Editor's Note: See Ch. 85, Subdivision and Site Plan Review.

appropriate use and enjoyment by the residents.
(g) Reforestation.
(12) Notwithstanding anything in Subsection G(4) hereof to the
contrary, land designated as agricultural, conservation or open
space may be incorporated into private lots which conform to this
article upon approval by the Planning Board that such land will be
permanently protected from development as an alternative to
dedication or protection by a homeowners' community association.
(13) Buffer areas.
(a) Any cluster development shall be buffered from adjoining
agriculture lands to create an effective barrier separating
yards and fields and pastures, to ensure that the continuation
of agricultural operations in the area will not be impaired by
nuisance complaints. The buffer shall, inasmuch as possible, be
a natural one. The dimensions of the buffer area and its
treatment with landscaping, natural berms and/or fencing shall
be subject to review and approval by the Planning Board.
(b) Additionally, there shall be a buffer area separating the cluster
from adjacent streets and residential areas. The dimensions of
the buffer area and its treatment with landscaping, berms or
fencing shall be subject to review and approval by the Planning
§ 101-17 TREES AND SHRUBS § 101-17

A. Any person desiring to subdivide and/or otherwise develop property in
the R-100 Rural Zone may elect to apply to the Planning Board for
major subdivision under the following reduced improvement
requirements of this section, with all other major subdivision
requirements applying. The Planning Board shall examine each request
to determine whether it meets the following minimum standard
requirements:
(1) The design of the development shall blend with the agricultural,
open space and rural atmosphere of the R-100 Zone.
(2) The development shall not adversely affect the development of
adjacent or adjoining property.
(3) Proposed local streets shall not interconnect with existing or
proposed streets in other classifications to form a continuous route.
They will be designed to discourage any through traffic, will have
the exclusive function of providing access to properties abutting
the street and will follow the contours of the land to the greatest
extent possible.
(4) The development shall provide for off-site pedestrian and bikeway
interconnections with other residential developments and public
facilities, e.g., schools and parks.
B. If it is determined by the Planning Board that the proposed
development conforms with the minimum standards listed in
Subsection A above, the following reduction in standards and
improvements may be allowed by the Board:
§ 101-19 TREES AND SHRUBS § 101-20
94:649
(1) The maximum street right-of-way shall be 40 feet, and the cartway

grades, drainage considerations or other site conditions require
their installation.
(6) The concrete sidewalk requirement may be waived under certain
conditions. In lieu of concrete sidewalks along one side of a street
contained within a subdivision, a five-foot-wide pedestrian walkway
of bituminous asphalt or other material acceptable to the Township
Engineer, installed along one side of a comprehensive walkway
network within the subdivision providing access to individual lots
and located outside of a street right-of-way, may be permitted.
(7) The maximum length of a cul-de-sac measured from an intersecting
street center line to the center point of the closed end of the cul-desac
shall not exceed 1,500 feet.
C. The following criteria shall be utilized by the Planning Board during
subdivision reviews within the R-100 Rural Zone where it is determined
that utilization of a rear-lotting technique is justified by the Board:
(1) Access to the rear lot may be through an access strip held in fee
simple ownership, not through an easement over adjacent property.
(2) The body of the lot, exclusive of the access strip connecting it to a
street, shall have an area and dimensions meeting the minimum
requirements for the zone.
(3) The access strip shall be continuous and under the same ownership
as the proposed rear lot.
(4) The intersection of the access strip with a street shall be such that
access to and from the street, and the improvement and use of the
access strip along the full course of the access strip and proper
sight triangles, as well as the drainage and other site
considerations, shall be provided in a manner not adversely
affecting the remainder of the tract or adjoining properties.
(5) The proposed subdivision shall not adversely affect the
development of the remainder of the parcel.

(6) In the event an additional lot or use is proposed, and said additional
lot can only achieve access via the access drive of the flag lot, the
owner of the access strip shall, at his expense, pave and improve it
in accordance with Township standards. Such road improvements
shall be made prior to the issuance of a building permit for the
additional structure. This shall not prevent the access drive to the
flag lot from serving abutting lots that otherwise have street
frontage.
(7) No more than two access strips shall be contiguous. The spacing
and ultimate number of access strips shall be determined by the
Planning Board during the subdivision review and approval
process.

ARTICLE IVB
R-150 Rural Zone Regulations
[Added 11-14-1988 by Ord. No. 0-88-33]
§ 101-24.1. Permitted uses.
In the R-150 Rural Zone, no lot shall be used and no structure shall be
erected, altered or occupied for any purpose except for the following:
A. Agriculture and farms.
B. Farm buildings.
C. Nurseries and greenhouses.
D. Riding academies, bridle paths and stables.
E. Detached single-family dwellings and structures accessory thereto.
F. Parks and playgrounds.
G. Conservation and open space areas, e.g., wilderness areas, forests,
wildlife refuge, scenic areas, bird sanctuaries and woodlot
management.
H. Necessary public utilities and services pursuant to § 101-13.6.
[Amended 10-10-2018 by Ord. No. 18-13]
I. Buildings, structures and uses owned and operated by the Township of
Plainsboro.
J. Rural residential planned village clusters, subject to the following
requirements and conforming to the findings of a planned development
as defined by the Municipal Land Use Law, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-45, and in
accordance with an approved general development plan.
(1) The minimum total area to be developed as a rural village cluster
shall be 150 acres. Such area shall be developed in accordance
with a single comprehensive general development plan. Streets
shall not be deemed to divide acreage for the purposes of this
requirement.
(2) For rural village cluster developments located in the R-150 Zoning
District, the maximum number of permitted lots shall be
determined by multiplying the net developable acreage of a tract,
after exclusion of environmentally constrained areas and public
rights-of-way, by 0.3 dwelling units per acre and multiplying the net
acreage of environmentally constrained areas and public rights-ofway
by one hundred 0.166 dwelling units per acre and adding the
resultant figures to establish the maximum number of lots.
"Environmentally constrained areas" shall include areas
designated as wetlands, one-hundred-year flood hazard areas,
water bodies and public rights-of-way. Detailed soil engineering
§ 101-24.1 TREES AND SHRUBS § 101-24.1
94:653
and geotechnical test data undertaken in accordance with
acceptable engineering standards and practices may be submitted
by an applicant if he seeks amendment of the boundary limits
established by state and federal regulatory agencies which define
such environmentally constrained areas.
(3) No less than 75% of a rural village cluster development shall be
devoted to agricultural, conservation, open space and/or
recreational purposes. All one-hundred-year flood hazard areas and
wetlands shall be permanently restricted for open space. Individual
residential lots or portions thereof shall not be construed as open
space. Designated agricultural, conservation, open space and/or
recreational areas shall be in major contiguous parcels and shall be
interconnected with similar areas on abutting tracts and parcels,
having adequate access to public and/or private roads and in some
cases consisting of land developed for specific recreational
purposes. Conservation, open space and/or recreational areas shall
also be interspersed within the village cluster development. Open
space may be used for sewage disposal systems using techniques
conforming to applicable environmental and engineering
standards. "Open space areas," for purposes of this calculation,
shall not include, among other things, courtyards, cul-de-sac
islands and miniparks.
(4) All dwelling units associated with rural village clusters shall be
required to locate within housing areas identified on the Plainsboro
Township Land Use Map.161
(5) Recreational facilities and open space.
(a) Active recreational facilities may be provided in a rural village
cluster development, subject to the review and approval of the
Planning Board. Such recreational facilities may be jointly
provided by two or more developers within the R-150 Zone
with convenient access to all users, provided that the facility
and/or recreational area shall equal the recreational
requirements of the participating properties served. The
location of such recreational facilities shall be carefully
planned to provide privacy for the users and to avoid problems
of noise, lighting and similar nuisances which might interfere
with their use and enjoyment by residents of the development.
(b) The design and use of open space areas interspersed among
groupings of residential dwellings shall protect the natural
resources and qualities of the site, including the natural
terrain, woodlands, significant views and any unique and
unusual features. Open space other than that preserved for its
natural values shall be suitably landscaped. All structures
within open space areas shall be sited so as to retain their
161. Editor's Note: A copy of this map is on file in the office of the Township Clerk.
§ 101-24.1 PLAINSBORO CODE § 101-24.1
94:654
visual appeal. The Planning Board shall require such grading,
drainage, planting, walkways, fencing, lighting and such other
improvements in the common open space as may be necessary
to enhance the intended open space and recreational uses.
(6) To the maximum extent practicable, rural village clusters shall be
located on land not well suited for agricultural purposes because of
size, location, proximity to neighboring land uses, existing tree
mass, access, shape, quality of soil and drainage. The design and
location of rural village clusters shall give priority to protecting the
most suitable soils for subsurface septic disposal (in unsewered
areas only); to leaving prime agricultural soils for agricultural uses;
to avoiding environmentally constrained areas; to locating
dwellings along wooded areas to reduce impacts upon agriculture,
to provide summer shade and shelter from winter wind and to
enable new residential construction to be visually absorbed by
natural landscape features; to not blocking or interrupting scenic
vistas, as seen from the public roadways; to locating dwelling units
and other improvements on the lower-quality agricultural soils.
(7) The Planning Board shall permit the subdivision of all existing, at
the time of ordinance adoption, single-family detached dwelling
units with accessory uses and/or farm buildings to be located on a
minimum lot size of one acre as part of the comprehensive
development plan for the village cluster development.
(8) The applicant for a rural village cluster development shall execute
such statement for prospective homeowners as the Planning Board
requires, which recognizes that the applicant is aware of the
purposes and requirements governing the R-150 Zone; that the
applicant and prospective homeowners are aware that certain
disturbances and annoyances arising from usual commercial
agricultural activities can reasonably be expected to occur
seasonally, both during the day and night; and that, in
consideration for being granted the right to construct or occupy a
nonfarm single-family dwelling in the zone, the applicant hereby
waives, on behalf of himself, his heirs, successors and assigns, all
right to object to such reasonable commercial agricultural
activities.
(9) When the major purpose of the rural village cluster is to preserve
open space for agricultural and farming purposes, all dwelling
units shall be located and constructed at such places on the tract
and in such a manner that, to the greatest extent possible, they
shall not segment land of any one farm into awkward or odd-shaped
parcel sizes difficult to support viable farming operations, nor
interfere with the conduct of agriculture, on- or off-site, by limiting
or interfering with the access to fields or the effectiveness and
efficiency of the farmer and farm equipment, including cropspraying
aircraft.
§ 101-24.1 TREES AND SHRUBS § 101-24.1
94:655
(10) The following minimum design, bulk and area requirements shall
apply to the development of a rural village cluster:
(a) The Planning Board shall determine the total number and
location of clusters at the time of general development plan
review.
(b) Land used for agricultural use shall be provided access for
farm equipment that does not interfere with rural village
cluster vehicular access.
(c) A development tract's existing road frontage shall not be
totally subdivided into residential lots.
(d) Impervious surfaces, in the aggregate, shall not cover more
than 40% of the net residential land (as defined above) of the
tract.
(e) All residential lots shall be serviced by a public centralized
water system and either a public sewer, community septic
system or individual septic systems, upon a demonstration that
such individual systems are permitted under state law and
New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection policy.
(f) No habitable dwelling unit area shall be constructed below
grade if the Township Engineer determines water problems
will result from existing soil limitations. Units shall be
designed in such a manner as to provide maximum security
and visual privacy from adjacent units.
(g) Twenty thousand square feet shall be the minimum lot area for
a residential lot The average lot area, including one dwelling,
its accessory uses and private open space, shall not be less
than 25,000 square feet.
[1] Frontage. The minimum street frontage shall be 125 feet.
[2] Lot width. The minimum lot width shall be 125 feet.
[3] Lot depth. The minimum lot depth shall be 150 feet.
[4] Front yard. The minimum front yard depth shall be 50 feet.
[5] Side yard. The minimum side yard width shall be 20 feet.
[6] Rear yard. The minimum rear yard depth shall be 30 feet.
[7] Building height. The maximum building height shall be 35
feet.
(h) The minimum lot frontage shall not be less than specified
above unless a lot adjoins a cul-de-sac or is on a curved
roadway alignment or is otherwise odd-shaped, in which case
§ 101-24.1 PLAINSBORO CODE § 101-24.1
94:656
the minimum lot width shall be measured at the front setback
line.
(i) New streets shall be constructed to service rural village cluster
developments instead of subdividing new lots along existing
minor arterial, major collector and minor collector roadways
within the R-150 Zone. In a subdivision abutting arterial or
collector roadways, the frontage shall be reversed so that the
lots contiguous to such streets will front on the newly-created
collectors, local streets or cul-de-sacs, with an additional lot
depth of 50 feet over and above bulk and area regulations. This
additional lot depth shall be a conservation easement used
exclusively for planting, screening and landscaped earthen
berms to be provided by the developer and maintained by the
lot owner or by a homeowners' association, if one is created.
(11) Land permanently set aside for agricultural, conservation, open
space and/or recreational uses may either be offered for dedication
to Plainsboro Township, deed-restricted to remain with the original
property owner, dedicated to a nonprofit organization found
acceptable to the Township Planning Board and/or protected by a
homeowners' community association. An open space which is not
accepted for public use by the Township Committee shall be
protected by legal arrangements satisfactory to the Planning Board
sufficient to assure its maintenance and preservation in perpetuity
for its intended purpose. Covenants or other legal arrangements
shall specify ownership of the open space; method of maintenance;
responsibility for maintenance; maintenance taxes and insurance;
compulsory assessment provisions; guaranties that any
homeowners' association formed to own and maintain open space
will not be dissolved without the consent of the Planning Board;
and any other specifications deemed necessary by the Planning
Board. The open space left unbuilt upon after development shall be
maintained in accordance with a land management plan prepared
by the developer and accepted and approved by the Planning
Board. The developer shall provide copies of deed covenants with
prospective purchases, or conservation easements with the
Township, describing land management practices to be followed by
party or parties that are responsible for open space. Further
subdivision of open space land, or its use for other than agriculture,
conservation and recreation, shall be prohibited.
(12)Within open space areas the Planning Board may require the
developer to make certain site preparation improvements, which
may include but are not limited to the following:
(a) Removal of dead or diseased trees.
(b) Thinning of trees or other growth to encourage more desirable
growth.
§ 101-24.1 TREES AND SHRUBS § 101-24.1
94:657
(c) Removal of trees in areas planned for ponds, lakes or active
recreational facilities.
(d) Grading and seeding.
(e) Improvements or protection of the natural drainage system
through the use of protective structures, stabilization
measures and similar improvements.
(f) Improvement and landscaping of ponds and lakes to afford
appropriate use and enjoyment by the residents.
(13) Notwithstanding anything in Subsection J(11) hereof to the
contrary, land designated as agricultural, conservation or open
space may be incorporated into private lots which conform to this
article upon approval by the Planning Board that such land will be
permanently protected from development as an alternative to
dedication or protection by a homeowners' community association.
(14) Any rural village cluster development shall be buffered from
adjoining agricultural lands to create an effective dense barrier
separating yards and fields and pastures, to ensure that the
continuation of agricultural operations in the area will not be
impaired by nuisance complaints. The buffer shall, inasmuch as
possible, be a natural one. The dimensions of the buffer area and its
treatment with landscaping, natural berms and/or fencing shall be
subject to review and approval by the Planning Board. Additionally,
there shall be a buffer area separating the village cluster from
adjacent streets and residential areas. The dimensions of the buffer
area and its treatment with landscaping, berms or fencing shall be
subject to review and approval by the Planning Board. However, as
a minimum, the buffer area along all lot and street lines shall be 50
feet wide.
(15)No preliminary approval shall be granted for any subdivision or site
plan in connection with the development of a rural village cluster
unless the Township Health Officer and Township Engineer have
approved plans for potable water supply and sewage disposal to
serve the development.
(16) All historic buildings, as identified on the Middlesex County
Inventory of Historic, Cultural and Architectural Resources,
located within a rural village cluster development shall be
permanently protected and reused by the developer, to the extent
feasible, in conformance with requirements received from the
Planning Board.
(17) Flexibility and variety in lot and building layout, roadway
construction, utility design and other site improvements shall be
encouraged to best relate the improvements to the land. To that
end, lots, buildings and utilities shall be designed so as to minimize

(2) In making its determination regarding the duration of the effect of
approval of the development plan, the Planning Board shall
consider the number of dwelling units to be constructed, prevailing
economic conditions, the timing schedule to be followed in
completing the development and the likelihood of its fulfillment,
the developer's capability of completing the proposed
development, and the contents of the general development plan
and any conditions which the Planning Board attaches to the
approval thereof.
(3) The developer shall be required to gain the prior approval of the
Planning Board if, after approval of the general development plan,
the developer wishes to make any variation in the location of land

regulations and the Township's Site Plan and Subdivision
Ordinances166 elsewhere. In computing the maximum number of
lots that may be created, any lands occupied by public utility
easements or wetlands or otherwise encumbered to the extent that
it would be considered unbuildable shall not be considered as a
lot in the preparation of the sketch plat. Lands which lie in flood
hazard areas shall be deemed acceptable for calculation of cluster
residential lots, provided that, by using standard subdivision design
criteria, a building and its associated septic field is not located
within a floodway. Dwellings shall be set back in conformance with
buffer requirements found in the New Jersey Freshwater Wetlands
Protection Act.167

protecting the most suitable soils for subsurface septic disposal (in
unsewered areas only); to leaving prime agricultural soils for
agricultural uses; to avoiding environmentally constrained areas;
to locating dwellings along wooded areas to reduce impacts upon
agriculture, to provide summer shade and shelter from winter wind
and to enable new residential construction to be visually absorbed
by natural landscape features; to not blocking or interrupting
scenic vistas, as seen from the public roadways; and to locating
dwelling units and other improvements on the lower-quality
agricultural soils.
(5) The Planning Board shall permit the subdivision of all existing
single-family detached dwelling units with accessory units and/or
farm buildings to be located on a minimum lot size of one acre as
part of the comprehensive development plan for the cluster
development at the time of ordinance adoption.
(6) The application for a cluster development shall execute such
statement for prospective homeowners as the Planning Board
requires which recognizes that the applicant is aware of the
purposes and requirements governing the R-150 Zone; that the
applicant and prospective homeowners are aware that certain
disturbances and annoyances arising from usual commercial
agricultural activities can reasonably be expected to occur
seasonally, both during the day and night; and that, in

consideration for being granted the right to construct or occupy
a nonfarm single-family dwelling in the zone, the applicant hereby
waives, on behalf of himself, his heirs, successors and assigns,
all right to object to such reasonable commercial agricultural
activities.
(7) When the major purposes of the cluster development is to preserve
open space for agricultural farming purposes, all dwelling units
shall be located and constructed at such places on the tract and in
such a manner that, to the greatest extent possible, they shall not
segment land of any one farm into awkward or odd-shaped parcel
sizes difficult to support viable farming operations, nor interfere
with the conduct of agriculture, on- or off-site, by limiting or
interfering with the access to fields or the effectiveness and
efficiency of the farmer and farm equipment, including cropspraying
aircraft.
(8) The following minimum design, bulk and area requirements shall
apply to the development of a cluster:
(a) The Planning Board shall determine the total number and
location of clusters at the time of subdivision and/or site plan
review.
(b) Land used for agricultural use shall be provided access for
farm equipment that does not interfere with cluster vehicular
access.
(c) A development tract's existing road frontage shall not be
totally subdivided into residential lots.

community septic system or individual septic systems upon a
demonstration that such individual systems are permitted
under state law and New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection policy.
(f) No habitable dwelling unit area shall be constructed below
grade if the Township Engineer determines water problems
will result from existing soil limitations. Units shall be
designed in such a manner as to provide maximum security
and visual privacy from adjacent units.
(g) If lots are clustered, they shall be subject to the criteria set
forth below:
[1] Lot area. The minimum lot area shall be one acre.
§ 101-24.3 TREES AND SHRUBS § 101-24.3
94:665
[2] Frontage and lot width. The minimum street frontage and
lot width shall be 170 feet.

roadway alignment or is otherwise odd-shaped, in which case
the minimum lot width shall be measured at the front setback
line.
(i) New streets shall be constructed to service cluster
developments instead of subdividing new lots along existing
minor arterial, major collector and minor collector roadways
within the R-150 Zone. In a subdivision abutting arterial or
collector roadways, the frontage shall be reversed so that the
lots contiguous to such streets will front on the newly created
collectors, local streets or cul-de-sacs, with an additional lot
depth of 50 feet over and above bulk and area regulations. This
additional lot depth shall be a conservation easement used
exclusively for planting, screening and landscaped earthen
berms to be provided by the developer and maintained by the
lot owner or by a homeowners' association, if one is created.
(9) During site plan and subdivision review, the following criteria shall
be addressed to the satisfaction of the Planning Board:

(10) Land permanently set aside for agricultural, conservation, open
space and/or recreational uses may either be offered for dedication
to Plainsboro Township, deed-restricted to remain with the original
property owner, dedicated to a nonprofit organization found
acceptable to the Township Planning Board and/or protected by a
homeowners' community association. An open space which is not
accepted for public use by the Township Committee shall be
protected by legal arrangements satisfactory to the Planning Board
sufficient to assure its maintenance and preservation in perpetuity
for agricultural, conservation, open space and/or recreational uses
as directed by the Planning Board. Covenants or other legal
arrangements shall specify ownership of the open space; method of
maintenance; responsibility for maintenance; maintenance taxes
and insurance; compulsory assessment provisions; guaranties that
any homeowners' association formed to own and maintain open
space will not be dissolved without the consent of the Planning
Board; and any other specifications deemed necessary by the
Planning Board. The open space left unbuilt upon after

The following shall be permitted accessory uses in the R-150 Rural Zone:
(g) Reforestation.
(12) Notwithstanding anything in Subsection A(7)(d) hereof to the
contrary, land designated as agricultural, conservation or open
space may be incorporated into private lots which conform to this
article upon approval by the Planning Board that such land will be
permanently protected from development as an alternative to
dedication or protection by a homeowners' community association.
(13) Buffer areas.
(a) Any cluster development shall be buffered from adjoining
agricultural lands to create an effective barrier separating
yards and fields and pastures, to ensure that the continuation
of agricultural operations in the area will not be impaired by
nuisance complaints. The buffer shall, inasmuch as possible, be
a natural one. The dimensions of the buffer area and its
treatment with landscaping, natural berms and/or fencing shall
be subject to review and approval by the Planning Board.
(b) Additionally, there shall be a buffer area separating the cluster
from adjacent streets and residential areas. The dimensions of
the buffer area and its treatment with landscaping, berms or
fencing shall be subject to review and approval by the Planning
Board. However, as a minimum, the buffer area along all lot
and street lines shall be 50 feet wide.
(14)No preliminary approval shall be granted for any subdivision or site
plan in connection with the development of a cluster development
unless the Township Health Officer and Township Engineer have
approved plans for potable water supply and sewage disposal to
serve the development.
(15) All historic buildings, as identified on the Middlesex County
Inventory of Historic, Cultural and Architectural Resources,
located within a cluster development shall be permanently
protected and reused by the developer, to the extent feasible, in
conformance with requirements received from the Planning
Board.169

major subdivision under the following reduced improvement
requirements of this section with all other major subdivision
requirements applying. The Planning Board shall examine each request
§ 101-24.4 TREES AND SHRUBS § 101-24.6
94:669
to determine whether it meets the following minimum standard
requirements:
(1) The design of the development shall blend with the agricultural,
open space and rural atmosphere of the R-150 Zone.
(2) The development shall not adversely affect the development of
adjacent or adjoining property.
(3) Proposed local streets shall not interconnect with existing or
proposed streets in other classifications to form a continuous route.

the street and will follow the contours of the land to the greatest
extent possible.
(4) The development shall provide for off-site pedestrian and bikeway
interconnections with other residential developments and public
facilities, e.g., schools and parks.
B. If it is determined by the Planning Board that the proposed
development conforms with the minimum standards listed in
Subsection A above, the following reduction in standards and
improvements may be allowed by the Board:
(1) The maximum street right-of-way shall be 40 feet, and the cartway

simple ownership, not through an easement over adjacent property.
(2) The body of the lot, exclusive of the access strip connecting it to a
street, shall have an area and dimensions meeting the minimum
requirements for the zone.
(3) The access strip shall be continuous and under the same ownership
as the proposed rear lot.
(4) The intersection of the access strip with a street shall be such that
access to and from the street, and the improvement and use of the
access strip along the full course of the access strip and proper
sight triangles, as well as the drainage and other site
considerations, shall be provided in a manner not adversely
affecting the remainder of the tract or adjoining properties.
(5) The proposed subdivision shall not adversely affect the
development of the remainder of the parcel.
(6) In the event an additional lot or use is proposed, and said additional
lot can only achieve access via the access drive of the flag lot, the
owner of the access strip shall, at his expense, pave and improve it
in accordance with Township standards. Such road improvements
shall be made prior to the issuance of a building permit for the
additional structure. This shall not prevent the access drive to the
flag lot from serving abutting lots that otherwise have street
frontage.
(7) No more than two access strips shall be contiguous. The spacing
and ultimate number of access strips shall be determined by the
Planning Board during the subdivision review and approval

The R-85 Zone is intended to permit and promote residential land uses
within or near the village area of the Township, including some of the
Township's oldest residential neighborhoods as well as some more recent
residential development. It is intended to preserve and/or encourage the
village residential building elements, historic character and relationships
that characterize some of the older portions of this zone district (e.g.,
open front porches and stoops, lower building heights and reduced front
setbacks), while providing adequate accommodation for expansion of
existing dwellings as well as for new infill residential construction to meet
contemporary household demands. These zone regulations are intended to
promote the creation of a residential environment that encourages a sense
of security, community and social interaction.
§ 101-36. Permitted uses.
In the R-85 Residence Zone, no lot shall be used and no structure shall be
erected, altered or occupied for any purpose except the following:
A. Detached single-family dwellings and the accessory structures and uses
normally auxiliary thereto.
B. Parks and playgrounds.
C. Garage facilities for only the motor vehicles owned by the occupant of
any single dwelling to which such garage is accessory.
D. Family day-care homes, subject to the terms set forth in the family daycare
home definition in § 101-1. [Amended 11-10-2011 by Ord. No.

A. There shall be a minimum lot area of 15,000 square feet for each singlefamily
dwelling or other principal structure herein permitted, except
that where any lot boundary is coterminous with the center line of any
street or road, such area shall be exclusive of the right-of-way.
B. With the exception of single-family lots that existed at the time this
article went into effect (July 20, 2004), all newly created lots in this
zone, whether resulting from the subdivision of a large lot into smaller
conforming lots or from the process of combining smaller lots, whether
conforming or not, to create a larger lot, the maximum dwelling size for
such a lot shall be based on the floor area ratio (FAR) limitations set
forth in § 101-46 of this chapter. However, where any such lot exceeds
15,000 square feet in area, the maximum dwelling size shall be as
permitted for a fifteen-thousand-square-foot lot.
C. Where an existing lot of 30,000 or more square feet contains an existing

used wholly or in part for general business purposes may be phased
and shall be designed so as to provide a comprehensive
development plan for the entire zone of which it is a part, the goals
being to share off-street parking and detention opportunities, have
well landscaped and generous building setbacks from Plainsboro
Road, provide off-street parking that is well-screened from public
view, control means of access and coordinate internal pedestrian
and vehicular traffic flows relating to existing or proposed
development, review utility extensions, ensure design compatibility
with existing development that considers building height,
materials, colors, landscaping and signage and mitigates any
negative visual impacts from public views.
C. Traffic and circulation.
(1) The developer shall be required to submit a detailed traffic study
showing the project's impact on the surrounding roadway network

generation during peak shopping center hours or during
peak commuting hours so as to cause the level of service of
the existing accessways in the GB Zone to fall below
service level D (as defined by the Federal Highway
Authority's Highway Capacity manual); or
[2] That the proposed driveway would reduce the volume of
traffic at the intersection of Schalks Crossing Road and
Plainsboro Road during peak shopping center hours or
during peak commuting hours.
(b) Implementation of the driveway access to Plainsboro Road
shall be permitted:
[1] Upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy for that phase
of new construction that the traffic study projected would
cause the level of service at existing GB accessways to
drop below the level specified in § 101-64.1C(3)(a)[1]
above; or
[2] At any time after the Planning Board has determined in
granting preliminary or final approval to any application
for development that such driveway would reduce the
volume of traffic as specified in § 101-64.1C(3)(a)[2]
above.
(c) The new driveway access at Plainsboro Road shall be
constructed with the provision of separate left turn lanes on
Plainsboro Road (entering traffic) and the new driveway
(exiting traffic). The left turn lane on Plainsboro Road should
also be extended to serve the left turn entering movement to
the adjacent PNC Bank property. Transition tapers for
Plainsboro Road traffic shall meet the approval of the Township

include such things as trees and shrubs. Such interior landscaping
shall be distributed throughout the parking lot in planting islands
to provide the maximum shade and buffer from noise and glare.
(3) Buffering shall be located within minimum yard setbacks. Buffer
areas shall be located along the edge of parking lots and property
lines that abut residentially zoned lots or uses to minimize
reflection of lights and to minimize windblown or other debris from
being blown to or seen from the adjacent or neighboring residential
premises. Buffering shall be designed to reduce the impacts of
§ 101-64.1 TREES AND SHRUBS § 101-64.1
94:703
noise, movement of people and vehicles and to shield activities

area(s) shall be provided. Design elements intended to make such
plaza area(s) inviting to pedestrians, such as patterns in pavement,
fountain(s), a gazebo, sculpture, a clock tower, bollards, sitting
areas and landscaping are encouraged.
J. Lighting. Adequate lighting shall be provided to ensure safe movement
of persons and vehicles and for security purposes. Directional lights
shall be arranged and shielded in such a manner as not to create a
hazard or nuisance to adjoining residential properties or to the
traveling public. Spotlight-type fixtures attached to buildings and
visible to the public shall not be permitted. Traditional freestanding
light fixtures shall be required in select areas along Schalks Crossing
Road, to supplement those to be installed as part of the public
improvements of that roadway, and elsewhere as appropriate. The style
of the freestanding light fixtures used shall be consistent with the
traditional styled street light fixtures planned for the village area along
Schalks Crossing Road. By way of example, a traditional street light and
parking lot light fixture shall be similar to the Hagerstown Model V03
by HADCO, which is a high-quality traditional freestanding light fixture
appropriate to a village environment. The height of such fixtures shall
be appropriate to their setting.
K. Decorative walls and fences.

temporary sales or leasing sign may be erected if the
project is under construction.
[10] The sign shall be located outside the public right-of-way on
land associated with the building or buildings to which it
refers, but not within an area designated as an open space
conservation area on the approved site plan. No sign shall
be located within a sight triangle or in any manner that

shall mean that such sign shall be removed within 14 days
of final execution of a contract of sale or lease for the
building involved that would result in a vacancy rate below
the standard set forth above.

VC Village Center Zone Regulations
[Added 6-14-2000 by Ord. No. 0-00-09]
§ 101-194. Purpose.
The VC Village Center Zone is intended to permit and promote a full
range of commercial, office, institutional and residential land uses within
a vibrant, pedestrian-friendly, mixed-use environment with an emphasis on
uses that service local needs. It is intended to encourage pedestrian flow
throughout the area by generally permitting stores and shops and personal
service establishments on the ground floor of buildings and promoting
the use of upper floors for offices and residential dwelling units in order
to enhance the orientation of land uses toward pedestrian shopping and
circulation within a village-style mixed-use environment.
§ 101-195. Goals.
The goals of the VC Village Center Zone include sharing off-street parking
and stormwater detention opportunities; having well-landscaped and
adequate building setbacks from surrounding roads; providing off-street
parking that is well screened from public view; controlling means of
vehicular access and coordinating internal pedestrian and vehicular traffic
flows relating to existing and proposed development patterns; and ensuring
design compatibility with existing development that considers building
height, materials, colors, landscaping and signage. A planned village center
development shall reflect the traditional village planning and design
principles contained in the Master Plan's Village Area Plan adopted by the
Planning Board as part of its Land Use Plan Element, including:
A. Provide for a street pattern that interconnects with existing and
proposed uses and links the neighborhoods together.
B. Provide a layout of streets and open space edges which encourages
sidewalk and pathway interconnections.
C. Provide for neighborhood focal points such as small parks or squares
and other open spaces, as appropriate, so that a sense of place is
enhanced and strengthened.
D. Promote the creation of a new neighborhood that is spatially
understood, limited in size and exhibits the design features of a
traditional mixed-use village neighborhood.
E. Promote the creation of a new place which promotes security and social
interaction.
F. Encourage a mix of residences, stores and shops, personal service
establishments, workplaces and institutional uses that are interwoven
within a traditional village neighborhood, all in close proximity.

facilities shall be provided.
F. Off-street parking. [Amended 12-13-2006 by Ord. No. 0-06-26;
12-12-2007 by Ord. No. 0-07-25; 12-10-2014 by Ord. No. 0-14-10]
(1) The number and location of off-street parking spaces shall be
determined by the schedule provided in § 85-44 of Chapter 85 of
the Township Code entitled "Subdivision and Site Plan Review."
These off-street parking requirements shall not be regarded as
inflexible as they pertain to a planned Village Center development.
(2) If the applicant can demonstrate that not all of the required
number of parking spaces are needed at the time of initial
occupancy and operation of the uses, then the additional required
parking which is demonstrated as not needed may be landbanked
or reserved for future parking on a space-per-space basis. The
location of future parking areas shall be indicated on the site plan
and left and maintained as landscaped areas. The methodology
used by the developer to calculate the reduced number of parking
spaces may take into consideration the methods recommended in
Shared Parking, published by the Urban Land Institute (1984), or
other recognized standards acceptable to the Planning Board. Offstreet
parking shall provided as required in § 85-44 of Chapter 85
unless the developer can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Planning Board through the use of a shared parking analysis,
taking into full account and consideration the parking needs of a
proposed cultural-recreational-educational facility, that an
adequate amount of parking will be provided on the site for all
proposed land uses.
(3) The number of required parking spaces may be reduced on a spaceper-
space basis if the applicant can demonstrate that suitable
alternative parking spaces are located within close proximity to the
subject property or site, through a shared parking arrangement
with an adjoining use. Those spaces, to be counted towards this
shared parking arrangement, must be demonstrated to be available
during the hours of operation of the affected uses, and access to
those spaces must be provided for vehicles and pedestrians in a
safe and efficient manner, including shared driveways and

confirm that the amount of parking provided is being utilized by the
development and, in fact, that the parking remains sufficient to
meet the needs of the development. If at any time it is determined
that this is no longer the case, the construction of additional
banked or reserved parking spaces may be required by the Director
of Planning and Zoning to meet the demand.
(5) Parking lots shall be kept as small and compact as possible and
interspersed in convenient locations intended to service building
clusters. The minimum distance between the edge of a right-of-way,
a parking lot or driveway and any building shall be 10 feet.

Review Ordinance,235 as applicable.
[2] The function and visual relationship between the agerestricted
village residential development and adjacent
developments.
[3] Sidewalks and pathways which are linked to off-site
sidewalk and pathway networks. The applicant shall utilize
the Township's Master Plan Pedestrian Circulation and
Bikeway Plans in designing and constructing a
comprehensive pedestrian and bicycle pathway network
for the development.
(u) No age-restricted unit shall be constructed unless the
following minimum design standards are met:
[1] The design of streets shall create blocks where an
individual block face dimension shall not exceed 600 feet
in length.
[2] All building exteriors shall generally have vertical and/or
horizontal offsets to create visual breaks on the exterior.
[3] A variety of building setbacks, rooflines, color schemes,
elevations and heights shall be required in the
development to avoid a repetitious and monotonous
streetscape. The use of muted or pastel colored exterior
building siding material is discouraged. The placement of
nonmultifamily units within the development shall be
varied so that the same elevation is not permitted adjacent
to one another, directly across the street from one another
or adjacent to the house directly across the street from one
another.
[4] The exteriors of all buildings in the development, including
any permitted accessory buildings, shall be architecturally
compatible and be constructed of complementary
materials. Design guidelines for future building
improvements shall be prepared by the applicant to ensure
the ongoing design integrity of the development.
[5] Architectural detail, style, color, proportion and massing
shall reflect the features of traditional village
neighborhoods.
[6] Natural materials such as wood and masonry are
recommended. High-quality man-made siding materials
are permitted. Stucco or similar treatment is prohibited on
all nonmultifamily unit type buildings.
235. Editor's Note: See Ch. 85, Subdivision and Site Plan Review.
§ 101-211 TREES AND SHRUBS § 101-211
94:813
[7] The multifamily age-restricted building may contain some
vinyl siding and stucco or similar treatment but only for
accent purposes. The building may also be designed to
reflect the use of a split face block and face brick, stone,
horizontal banding and panels, windows with clear
anodized aluminum finish and exterior column covers for
canopies and porches. The overall design of the
multifamily age-restricted building shall, as appropriate,
complement the architecture of nearby nonmultifamily
units.
[8] Pitched roofs 5 to 12 to 12 to 12 are recommended. Roof
pitches shall generally be consistent throughout the
development. Peak roofs are encouraged. Flat and
mansard roofs are discouraged.
[9] The front facade of the nonmultifamily age-restricted units
is dedicated to the public view and shall therefore reflect a
traditional village character, which may include simple
rectangular cottage architectural precedents with
decorative detailing. Awnings, open and useable porches
(minimum eight-foot depth), stoops, bay windows,
balconies and/or other similar decorative architectural
treatments are required and may encroach into building
setback lines. The rear elevations of the nonmultifamily
age-restricted units shall have substantial architectural
features to preclude flat and monotonous elevations.
[10] Garages for single-family units may be front or side entry.
A mix of front and side entry garages are required. Side
entry garages may be located forward of the main facade
of the house. Front entry garages are prohibited forward
of the main facade or porch of the house. Windows are
encouraged on garages to admit light and eliminate blank
walls. Sufficient storage area to accommodate tools, auto
accessories, trash/recyclable materials storage, lawn and
garden maintenance equipment, etc. should be considered
in sizing the garage so that an accessory storage structure
will not be necessary (see § 101-211A(1)(w)[5]). Individual
bay overhead garage doors are required, except for side
entry garages. Detached garages may be offered as a
permitted option on certain available single-family
detached and semidetached units.
[11] All single-family detached, single-family semidetached and
townhouse units are encouraged to have clearly defined
front yards using landscaping, hedging, fencing or a brick
or stone wall, none of which shall exceed three feet in
height.
§ 101-211 PLAINSBORO CODE § 101-211
94:814
[12] All single-family, semidetached and/or townhouse units
shall be strategically dispersed throughout the
development to terminate streets, accent the overall
design and add variety to the residential village
neighborhood.
[13] Townhouse buildings shall consist of no more than five
townhouse dwelling units in order to prevent the
development of long and monotonous buildings and ridge
lines, which serve to increase the sense of density and
building mass. There shall be different roofline heights and
vertical offsets in each overall townhouse building. No
more than two adjacent townhouse units shall have the
same building offset, which shall vary by at least four feet.
[14] Multifamily age-restricted units shall be located at the
northwest entrance of the planned age-restricted village
residential development near the intersection of
Plainsboro Road and Enterprise Drive to create an
architectural "terminus" to Plainsboro Road and a gateway
entrance into the residential village neighborhood.
[15] All dwelling units, except multifamily units, shall have a
private outdoor space, including a deck, patio or terrace,
which may be enclosed by a decorative fence or wall,
evergreen hedge, or combination thereof. Each
multifamily unit shall be encouraged to have private
outdoor spaces on the first level and a usable balcony on
the upper level.
[16] At least 15 of the single-family units shall be two-story
units.
[17] All units shall be connected to approved and functioning
public water and sanitary sewer systems. Prior to
approval, an applicant must obtain a certificate from the
appropriate agency allocating capacity in the system to the
development.
[18] The development shall provide for the orderly removal of
trash and garbage. Management of solid waste and
recyclables shall be subject to Planning Board review and
approval.
[19] Special ground texture treatment shall be required for
pedestrian crossings in streets and elsewhere, as
appropriate, to include brick, stone, cobbles and/or other
suitable material.
[20] Lighting shall be the minimum required for safety and
must be provided in the least intrusive manner. Traditional
freestanding light fixtures shall be required in parking lots
§ 101-211 TREES AND SHRUBS § 101-211
94:815
and along streets and pedestrian pathways. The height of
such light fixtures shall be appropriate to its setting.
[21] Landscape details such as gates, walls and benches shall
be integrated into the overall design.
[22] A coordinated sign package must be provided for review
prior to preliminary approval. The size, location, design,
color, texture, lighting and materials of all temporary and
permanent signs shall not detract from the design of
proposed buildings and structures and the surrounding
properties.
[23] Detention basins, headwalls, outlet structures, concrete
flow channels, riprap channels and other drainage
improvements shall be screened with plant material and/or
berms. Such drainage structures, as appropriate, shall be
situated in the least visible location or, if visible,
incorporated into the natural curves of the land. Detention
basin embankments and the basin itself shall be
extensively landscaped with wet-site tolerant plant
materials with the intention of recreating a seasonal and
high water wet ecosystem. The detention facility shall be
sized to accommodate the future growth of vegetation
planted in the basin.
(v) Open space and recreation facility requirements.
[1] Open space shall be optimally related to the overall plan
and design of the development and improved to best suit
the purpose(s) for which it is intended. No less than 15%,
less existing and proposed road rights-of-way, shall be
devoted to open space and/or recreation facility purposes.
Individual residential lots or portions thereof shall not be
construed as open space. Stormwater detention basins
may be included in the open space calculation. Such
designated open space shall be in parcels interspersed
among grouping of residential dwellings, where
appropriate, and, where possible, shall be interconnected
with open space areas on abutting parcels. Also, such open
space areas shall be provided with adequate street access
and may include land developed for specific purposes (e.g.,
stormwater detention). Active and passive recreational
facilities shall be provided in an age-restricted village
residential development for the use and enjoyment of the
residents of the development and their guests, which may
consist of the following: an in-ground neighborhood
swimming pool provided with an improved sitting area,
contiguous to all sides of the pool; a clubhouse with
meeting rooms; multipurpose space; fully equipped game
rooms; art and craft rooms; fully equipped kitchen; office

exercise areas and stations; picnic facilities; outdoor
sitting areas; gardening areas with a communal
greenhouse; and a system of handicapped-accessible
sidewalks and pathways. Recreational facilities within the
multifamily building may include a library, workout room,
multimedia room and billiard room. The location of such
recreational facilities shall be carefully planned to provide
privacy for the users and to avoid problems of noise,
spillover lighting and similar nuisances on nearby
residential units. All recreational facilities shall be
subordinated to the residential character of the
development and be appropriate to a planned agerestricted
village residential development. Open space
shall be suitably landscaped. All structures within open
space areas shall be sited so that the open space retains
its visual appeal. The Planning Board shall require active
and/or passive recreational facilities and such grading,
drainage, planting, sidewalks, pathways, fencing, lighting
and such other improvements in open space as may be
necessary to enhance the intended open space and
recreational uses.
[2] All property, roadways, parking areas, entrances,
landscaping, facilities and other common areas within the
VR II Zone shall be privately owned and maintained in
accordance with a plan for such maintenance approved by
the Planning Board and implemented by legal
documentation to be reviewed and approved by the
Planning Board Attorney.
[3] Land to be devoted to public purposes may be offered to
the Township or may be owned and maintained by an open
space organization. Any lands intended to be offered to the
Township for public purposes shall be so declared prior to
preliminary approval. All lands not offered to and/or not
accepted by the Township shall be owned and maintained
by an open space organization, subject to Planning Board
approval.

architectural character, building height, bulk, materials, colors and
landscaping; providing adequate on-street and off-street parking; and
coordinating vehicular and pedestrian circulation with existing and planned
developments, including applicable provisions of the Circulation Plan
Element of the Master Plan. A planned village residential area shall reflect
the traditional village planning and design principles contained in the
Master Plan's "Village Area Plan" adopted by the Planning Board as part of
its Land Use Plan Element, including:
A. Provide for a street pattern that interconnects with existing and
proposed uses and links the neighborhoods together.
B. Provide a layout of streets and open space edges which encourages
sidewalk and pathway interconnections.
C. Provide for neighborhood focal points such as small parks or
community spaces and other open spaces, as appropriate, so that a
sense of place is fostered and enhanced.
D. Promote the creation of a new neighborhood that is spatially
understood, limited in size, and exhibits the design features of a
traditional village neighborhood.
E. Promote the creation of an environment that encourages a sense of
security and social interaction.
F. Buildings within a planned village residential development shall form a
consistent streetscape, spatially delineating public street spaces and
private yards.

A. The purpose of this article is to establish guidelines for the siting of
wireless telecommunications towers and antennas and ancillary
facilities.
B. The goals of this article are to:
(1) Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impacts of towers and antennas;
(2) Encourage the location of towers on municipally owned property
where appropriate or in other nonresidential areas;
(3) Minimize the total number of towers throughout the Township;
(4) Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as
a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use
towers;
(5) Encourage the use of existing buildings, telecommunications
towers, light or utility poles and/or towers, or water towers as
opposed to construction of new telecommunications towers;
(6) Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the
extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the
community is minimal;
(7) Ensure that all telecommunications facilities, including towers,
antennas and ancillary facilities are located and designed to
minimize the visual impact on the immediate surroundings and
throughout the Township by encouraging users of towers and
antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse
visual impact of the towers and antennas through careful design,
siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging
techniques;
(8) Consider the public health and safety of telecommunications
towers; and
(9) Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through engineering and careful siting of tower structures.
C. In furtherance of these purposes, the Township shall give due
consideration to the Township's Master Plan, Zoning Map, existing land
uses, and environmentally sensitive areas in approving sites for the
location of towers and antennas.

C. District height limitations. The requirements set forth in this article
shall govern the location of telecommunications towers that exceed,
and antennas that are installed at a height in excess of, the height
limitations specified for each zoning district.
D. Public property. Towers and antennas located on property owned,
leased or otherwise controlled by the Township shall be encouraged
where the Planning Board deems such location to be appropriate for
such facility and the Township Committee has approved a license or
lease authorizing such facility.
E. Amateur radio station operators/receive-only antennas. This article
shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is
under 50 feet in height and is owned and operated by a federally
licensed amateur radio station operator or is under 50 feet in height
and is used exclusively for receive only antennas.
F. Satellite dish antennas. This article shall not govern parabolic dish
antennas measuring two feet or less in diameter or when used solely for
household purposes for the transmission or reception of
electromagnetic waves associated with satellites.
A. Principal or accessory use. Notwithstanding any other Land Use
Regulation, an existing building(s) and use on a lot shall not preclude
the installation of a telecommunications tower (including appurtenant
structures) and/or antenna on the same lot. If such tower and/or
antenna constitute the sole use of the lot, then such use shall be
deemed the principal use of the lot; otherwise, the use shall be
considered accessory.
B. Leased area. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a
tower or antenna complies with zone regulations, including but not
limited to setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other
such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even
though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within
such lot.
C. State or federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current
standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of
the state or federal government with the authority to regulate towers
and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the
owners of the towers and antennas governed by this article shall bring
such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards
and regulations within 90 days of the effective date of such standards

§ 101-226. Use regulations.
and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule is established
by the controlling state or federal agency. Failure to bring towers and
antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations,
where mandated to do so, shall constitute grounds for the removal of
the tower or antenna at the owner's expense.
D. Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of
towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in
compliance with standards contained in applicable state or local
building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are
published by the Electronic Industries Association and
Telecommunications Industry Association, as amended from time to
time. If, upon inspection, the Township concludes that a tower fails to
comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to
persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of
the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into
compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into
compliance within said 30 days shall constitute grounds for the removal
of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense.
E. Not essential services. Telecommunications towers and antennas shall
be regulated and permitted pursuant to this article and shall not be
regulated or permitted as essential services, public utilities, or private
utilities.
F. Collocation required. The Township mandates that carriers collocate
antennas on towers and other structures whenever possible. See
§ 101-228 for collocation requirements.

§ 101-227. Site design standards.
The following site design standards shall apply to wireless
telecommunications facilities:
B. Prohibited use. Wireless telecommunications facilities are prohibited
on all lands used for public and private schools and on all lands located
in the R-85, R-90, R-200, R-300, R-350, VR-1, VR-2, VC, SR, NB, OB-1,
ECA, and Cemetery Zones. [Amended 11-10-2010 by Ord. No.
0-10-25]
C. Permitted use standards. Wireless telecommunications facilities may be
permitted on lands identified in § 101-226A, provided that:
(1) New lattice towers and any type of guyed tower are prohibited.
Existing lattice towers can be increased in height for the purposes
of accommodating additional antennas.
(2) Telecommunications towers shall be limited to monopoles and shall
be designed to accommodate at least five carriers. The maximum
height of such towers shall be 200 feet or the height above which
the FAA would require special painting and/or lighting, whichever
is less.
D. General review standards. In addition to the above standards, the
Planning Board may consider the following factors in its review of a site
plan for a proposed telecommunications tower:
(1) Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential
district boundaries;
(2) Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
(3) Surrounding topography;
(4) Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
(5) Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating
visual obtrusiveness, including stealth designs, which are
encouraged;
(6) Availability of suitable existing towers, alternative tower
structures, other structures or alternative technologies not
requiring the use of towers or structures;
(7) Availability of proposed tower to other potential carriers.
A. New towers.
(1) New telecommunications towers shall not be located closer than
1,000 feet to a residential property line. All antennas located on
existing buildings or structures, including towers, are exempt from
this requirement.
§ 101-226 PLAINSBORO CODE § 101-227
94:838
(2) Fall zone. A fall zone shall be established such that the tower is
setback 110% of the height of the tower from any adjoining lot line
or non-appurtenant building.
(3) Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not
less than eight feet in height. Towers shall also be equipped with
appropriate anticlimbing measures or devices.
(4) Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the
landscaping surrounding towers:
(a) Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant
materials that effectively screens the view of the tower
compound. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped
strip at least 10 feet wide outside the perimeter of the
compound. However, at a minimum, the facility should be
shielded from public and private view by evergreen trees at
least 10 feet high at planting and planted in staggered double
rows 10 to 15 feet on center.
(b) Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site
shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some
cases, such as towers sited on large wooded lots, natural
growth around the property perimeter may be a sufficient
buffer.
(5) Ancillary buildings. Any proposed building(s) enclosing related
electronic equipment for one or more carriers shall not exceed 10
feet in height and 200 square feet in area for each carrier at a
facility. When a carrier's equipment is to be contained by itself in a
separate, individual building, each carrier shall be limited to one
such building. Such buildings must satisfy the minimum setback
requirements for accessory buildings in the zoning district. Where
multiple buildings are proposed at a facility serving multiple
carriers, the placement of each such building shall be done in a
visually and functionally coordinated manner, with the goal being
that of maximizing the number of possible carriers at a facility
while minimizing the area of the overall compound required for
such facility.
(6) Aesthetics. Towers and antennas shall meet the following
requirements:
(a) Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or,
subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a
neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness, as
determined appropriate by the Planning Board.
(b) At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related
structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors,
textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend them into
the natural setting and surrounding buildings.
§ 101-227 TREES AND SHRUBS § 101-227
94:839
(7) Lighting. No lighting is permitted except as follows, which shall be
subject to review and approval by the Planning Board as part of the
site plan application:
(a) The building enclosing electronic equipment may have one
light at the entrance to the building, provided that the light is
attached to the building, is focused downward and is switched
so that the light is turned on only when authorized personnel
are at the building; and
(b) No lighting is permitted on a tower except lighting that
specifically is required by the FAA, and any such required
lighting shall be focused and shielded to the greatest extent
possible so as not to project towards adjacent and nearby
properties.
(8) Signs. No signs are permitted except those required by the Federal
Communications Commission, the Electronic Industries
Association (ETA) and/or the Telecommunications Industry
Association (TIA) or by law, such as warning and equipment
information signs.
B. Antennas mounted on existing buildings or structures.
(1) Antennas on existing buildings or structures. Any antenna which is
not attached to a tower may be attached to any existing business,
industrial, office, utility or institutional building or structure in the
Township, provided that:
(a) Side- and roof-mounted personal wireless service facilities
shall not project more than ten feet above the height of an
existing building or structure nor project more than ten feet
above the height limit of the zoning district within which the
facility is located. Personal wireless service facilities may be
located on a building or structure that is legally nonconforming
with respect to height, provided that the facilities do not
project above the existing building or structure height.
(b) The antenna complies with all applicable FCC and FAA
regulations.
(c) The antenna complies with all applicable codes.
(d) The equipment structure shall not contain more than 200
square feet of gross floor area or be more than 10 feet in
height. In addition, for existing buildings and structures that
are less than 35 feet in height, the related unmanned
equipment structure shall be located on the ground and not on
the roof of the building or structure.
[1] If the equipment structure is located on the roof of a
building, the area of the equipment structure and other
§ 101-227 PLAINSBORO CODE § 101-227
94:840
§ 101-228. Collocation.
equipment and structures shall not occupy more than 10%
percent of the roof area.
[2] Equipment storage buildings, structures or cabinets shall
comply with all applicable building codes.
(2) Aesthetics. If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a
tower, the antenna, supporting electrical and mechanical
equipment, as well as any equipment storage buildings, structures
or cabinets, must be of a color that is identical to or closely
compatible with the color of the supporting building or structure,
so as to make the antenna and related equipment and structures as
visually unobtrusive as possible.
(3) While it is anticipated that antennas mounted on buildings or
structures as referenced in § 101-227B(1) above would involve
existing buildings or structures, their placement on new buildings
or structures is permitted where such facilities are otherwise
permitted pursuant to § 101-226A and subject to the requirements
of Subsections B(1) and B(2) immediately above.
C. Antennas on existing towers. An antenna may be attached to an existing
tower and, to minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the
proliferation and clustering of towers, collocation of antennas by more
than one carrier on such towers shall take precedence over the
construction of new towers, provided such collocation is accomplished
in a manner consistent with the following:
(1) A tower that is modified or reconstructed to accommodate the
collocation of additional antennas shall be of the same tower type
as the existing tower, unless reconstruction as a monopole is
proposed.
(2) An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller height, not
to exceed the maximum tower height established by this article.
After the tower is rebuilt to accommodate collocation, only one
tower may remain on the site.
A. The Township requires that licensed carriers share personal wireless
service facilities and sites, where feasible and appropriate, thereby
reducing the number of personal wireless service facilities that are
stand-alone facilities. All applicants for site plan approval for a personal
wireless service facility shall demonstrate best efforts to collocate with
other carriers. Such best efforts shall include:
(1) A survey of all existing structures that may be feasible sites for
collocating personal wireless service facilities;

approval.
B. Unless otherwise specifically set forth in this article, development in
the ECA Zone shall be subject to all applicable requirements set forth in

should be considered by the board of jurisdiction in its review of any
site plan application for development in the ECA Zone. These are
intended to serve as guidelines, not regulations:
(1) All buildings and structures should be designed to harmonize with
the character of the existing site and principal buildings and should
be located and designed using existing and additional landscaping,
appropriate high quality building materials (e.g., stone, brick,
precast masonry, or high quality wood projects), and color to
enhance their appearance and mitigate any adverse visual impact
from both on- and off-site locations.
(2) All building additions should utilize traditional sloping roofs
consistent with the general character of the existing buildings,
which roofs should be covered with high quality roofing materials
such as standing seam metal roofing or slate (or comparable) roof
shingles.
(3) To the greatest extent possible, within the context of the proposed
development, existing site characteristics, including unique
topographic features and mature landscaping, should be
preserved, and site disturbance minimized.
(4) Additional landscaping should be used to enhance the character of
the site, help screen parking areas visible from the street, and
improve the effectiveness of buffer areas near property lines of
neighboring residential areas.
(5) All fences and walls should be constructed of high quality materials
such as, but not limited to, traditional black wrought iron or similar
metal picket-type fence, stone, brick or similar type of masonry
wall.
(6) Special attention should be given to general interior vehicular and
pedestrian circulation, including by designing and locating
walkways, interior drives, and parking in such manner as to
maintain proper separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and
provide parking areas that promote efficiency, safety, and
environmental sensitivity.
