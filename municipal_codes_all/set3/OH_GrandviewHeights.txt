EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

CHARTER
OF THE CITY OF
GRANDVIEW HEIGHTS, OHIO
PREAMBLE
   We, the people of the City of Grandview Heights of the County of Franklin,
State of Ohio, in order to secure for ourselves the benefits of municipal home
rule and exercise the powers of local self-government under the Constitution of
the State of Ohio, do ordain and establish this Charter for the government of
the City of Grandview Heights.
CHAPTER 1.  POWERS
Section 1.1  Corporate Powers.
   The municipal corporation now existing and known as the City of Grandview
Heights shall have full power and authority to change its boundaries and
enlarge its corporate limits by the annexation or detachment of territory in
the manner authorized by State law. The City shall have all the powers granted
to cities by the Constitution and laws of Ohio. All such powers, whether
expressed or implied, shall be exercised and enforced in the manner provided by
ordinance or resolution of Council or, absent such provision, by State law.
Section 1.2   Nonexclusivity of Powers.
   The enumeration of particular powers in this Charter shall not be deemed to
be exclusive of other powers, and the City shall have all other powers granted
to cities under the Constitution and laws of Ohio.
Section 1.3  State Law to be Applicable.
   State law applicable to municipal corporations, now in force or hereafter
enacted, and which is not in conflict with this Charter, or with ordinances or
resolutions here before or hereafter enacted by the Council, shall be
applicable to this Municipality. Nothing contained in this Charter shall be
construed as limiting the power of Council to enact any ordinance or resolution
not in conflict with the Constitution of the State or with the express
provisions of this Charter.
   Any section or part of a section of this Charter held invalid by a court of
competent jurisdiction shall not affect the remainder.

are prescribed by State law. If the Mayor ceases to possess these
qualifications, then the office shall be forfeited.
Section 2.3. Office and Compensation of the Mayor.
   The office of the Mayor shall be in a Municipal Building of the City. The

Section 2.4.  General Powers and Duties of the Mayor.
   It shall be the duty of the Mayor to act as chief conservator of the peace

enforced; to supervise the administration of the affairs of the City; to
recommend to Council for its adoption such measures deemed necessary or
expedient; to keep Council advised of the condition and needs of the City; to
prepare and submit to the
   Council such reports as may be required by Council; and to exercise such
powers and perform such duties as are conferred or required by this Charter, by
ordinance or resolution of Council, or by State law insofar as it is consistent
with this Charter, or by such State law as is beyond the power of this Charter
to supersede.
   The Mayor shall have and exercise all powers and perform all duties that are
delegated to and conferred upon directors of public safety and directors of
public service of cities by State law not inconsistent with the provisions of
this Charter.

on the last day of that month. 
(ORC 1.45)
      (3)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be

performed, is closed to the public for the entire day which constitutes the

101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
 
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance. 
(ORC 1.54)
 
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:

liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;

incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance

(ORC 1.58)
101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof. 
(ORC 1.55)
 
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included. 
(ORC 1.56)
 
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances. 
(ORC 1.23)

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. 
(ORC 1.46)
 
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail. 
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation. 
(ORC 1.52)
101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United

service needs.
   (e)   The site from which the employment positions would be relocated is

entity.

corporation from which the employment positions would be relocated has been
notified of the proposed relocation.

inducements, if each inducement meets the criteria for that inducement, both
alone and in conjunction with all other proposed inducements, as determined in
the discretion of the City Council.
   (b)   The City Council shall determine:
      (1)   The first and last taxable year for which an economic inducement
may be claimed,
      (2)   The first and last period for which the business entity must

   (b)   A bidder for a contract with the City required to be bid competitively
shall be considered responsive if said bidder's bid proposal responds to bid
specifications in all material respects and contains no irregularities or
deviations from the specifications which would affect the amount of the bid or
otherwise give the bidder any competitive advantage.  Any bid which fails to

efficiency of the bidder;
      (8)    The quality, availability, and adaptability of the supplies or
contractual services to the particular use required;
      (9)    The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and
service for the use of the subject of the contract, where applicable;
      (10)    The number and scope of conditions attached to the bid; and

   (f)   The Board of Control or its designee shall obtain from the lowest

than the lowest responsive bidder shall be notified of the finding that its bid
was non-responsive and the reasons for the finding, in writing, by certified
mail.

bidders may be required to provide some or all of such information as outlined

finding that such bidder is not best.  In the alterntivate all bidders shall be

and in the event all bidders are not rejected, the Board of Control shall
follow the procedures set forth herein with each next lowest responsive bidder
until the contract shall be awarded or in the alternative, all bidders are
rejected.
   (l)   In the event that not all bids are rejected as provided for herein,
any bidder who is notified in accordance with this Chapter may object to the
rejection of its bids upon filing a formal written protest which shall be
received by the Director of Public Safety or designee within five (5) days of
the receipt of the rejection notification provided to the rejected bidder as
set forth herein, as applicable.
   (m)    In the event of the receipt of a timely protest filed pursuant to
this section by a rejected bidder, the Director of Public Safety or designee
shall meet with the protesting bidder to hear the bidder's objection.
   (n)     No award of a contract shall become final until after the Director

section and the award is confirmed by vote of the majority of the Board of
Control.
   (o)     In the event that all protests as filed pursuant to this section are

application procedures set forth herein, such bidder is determined then to be
the lowest and best bidder, the contract shall be awarded to such bidder and

(Ord. 2015-12.  Passed 4-20-15.)
TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171.  Mayor's Court
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE:  The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months.  "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later.  Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases. 
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above.  Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973):  "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C).  If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipalty and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality.  Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C):  "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any.  Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case.  Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

as otherwise provided in subsection (b) hereof, net profit from a business or
profession conducted both within and without the boundaries of the City shall
be considered as having a taxable situs in the City for purposes of the tax in
the same proportion as the average ratio of:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
City during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of the real
and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or

As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include property rented
or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by

   (b)    In the event that the foregoing business allocation percentage
formula does not produce an equitable result, another basis may, under uniform
regulations, be substituted by the Director of  Finance or his delegate so as
to produce such result.

in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the sales result
from such solicitation or promotion.
      (3)    All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the City to purchasers outside the City regardless of where title
passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in
the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
   (d)    Except as otherwise provided in division (e) of this section, net
profit from rental activity not constituting a business or profession shall be
subject to tax only by the City only if the property generating the net profit
is located in the City.
   (e)    This section does not apply to individuals who are residents of the

Code, the City may impose a tax on all income earned by residents of the City

181.04  LEVY OF TAX.
   (a)    Such tax shall be levied, collected and paid with respect to the
salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned on and after July 1,
1983, and with respect to the net profits of  business, professions or other
activities earned on and after July 1, 1983. Provided, however, that where the
fiscal years of the business, profession or other activity differs from the
calendar year the tax shall be applied to that part of the net profits for the
fiscal year as shall be earned on and after July 1, 1983, to the close of the
taxpayer's fiscal year. Thereafter, the taxpayer shall report on its fiscal
year basis.
   (b)    Where the fiscal year of a business, profession or other activity is
other than a calendar year, in computing initial tax the profits of such
taxpayer shall be determined by dividing the annual profits by twelve and
multiplying the quotient by the number of months within the period commencing
July 1, 1983, and ending at the conclusion of such fiscal year.
(Ord. 05-38.  Passed 10-3-05.)
181.05  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)    Each taxpayer who engages in business or other activity, or whose

Finance, including a generic form if the generic form, when completed and
filed, contains all the information required by the prescribed form,  setting
forth the aggregate amount of qualifying wages,  commissions, other
compensation earned and/or net profits earned and/or gross income from any

the close of such fiscal year or other period.
   (b)    Commencing with taxable years beginning subsequent to December 31,
1981, the net loss from an unincorporated business activity may not be used to
offset qualifying wages, commissions or other compensation. However, if a
taxpayer is engaged in two or more taxable business activities to be included
in the same return, the net loss of one unincorporated business activity,
except any portion of a loss separately reportable for municipal tax purposes
to another taxing entity, may be used to offset the profits of another for
purposes of arriving at overall net profits.
   (c)    A husband and wife, in any taxable year, may elect to file separate
or joint returns.
   (d)    If a net operating loss has been sustained in any taxable year, such
loss may not be carried forward or backward to any other taxable year.
   (e)    Any affiliated group that files a consolidated return for federal
income tax purposes pursuant to section
1501 of the Internal Revenue Code may file a consolidated return with the City.

a separate return with the City, the affiliated group may not change its method
of filing in any subsequent tax year without written approval from the City.
   (f)    The taxpayer making a return shall at the time of the filing thereof,
pay to the City the amount of taxes shown as due thereon, provided, however,
that where any portion of the tax so due shall have been deducted at the source
pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.07 or where any portion of such tax has been paid by the taxpayer pursuant
to the provisions of Section
181.08, or where an income tax has been paid to another municipality, credit
for the amount so paid in accordance with Section
181.13 shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance,
if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return.
 
   (g)    A taxpayer who has overpaid the taxpayer's income tax in any taxable
year may request a refund provided, however, there is no other tax liability
and provided, further, that no amount of less than one dollar ($1.00) will be
refunded or collected.
 
   (h)    The Director of Finance or his delegate shall have the authority to
extend the time for filing of the annual return upon the request of the
taxpayer for a period not to exceed six months, or one month beyond any
extension requested of or granted by the Internal Revenue Service for the
filing of the federal income tax return.  The extension request may be made by
filing a copy of the taxpayer's request for a federal filing extension, or by
filing a written request. The Director of Finance or his delegate may require a
tentative return, accompanied by payment of the amount of tax shown to be due
thereon by the date the return is normally due. No penalty or interest shall be
assessed in those cases in which the return is filed and the final tax paid
within the period as extended.

liability affecting the taxpayer's City tax liability, such taxpayer shall make
and file an amended City return showing income subject to the City tax based
upon such final determination of federal tax liability, and pay any additional
tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment.
   (c)    No refund shall be allowed unless a written request is presented to

employees and shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close
of each calendar quarter, make a return showing the amount of taxes so deducted
and a record of payments showing that all taxes deducted during the quarter
have been paid to the City in accordance with the payment schedule prescribed
by subsection (b)(1), (2) and (3) hereof. Such employer shall be liable for the
payment of the  tax required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such
taxes have in fact been withheld. Every employer is deemed to be a trustee for

withheld and the funds so collected by such withholding are deemed to be trust
funds.
   (b)    Employers shall pay to the City all income taxes withheld or required
to be deducted and withheld on either a semi-monthly, monthly, or quarterly
basis depending on the amount of taxes involved according to the following
payment schedule:

employer if the total taxes deducted in the prior calendar year were twelve
thousand dollars ($12,000) or more, or the amount of taxes deducted for any
month in the preceding quarter exceeded one thousand dollars ($1,000). Such
payment shall be paid to the City within five banking days after the fifteenth
and the last day of each month.
      (2)    Monthly payments of taxes withheld shall be made by an employer if
the taxes withheld in the prior calendar year were less than twelve thousand
dollars ($12,000) but more than one thousand one hundred and ninety-nine
dollars ($1,199) or if the taxes withheld during any month for the  preceding
quarter exceeded one hundred dollars ($100.00). Such payments shall be paid to
the City within fifteen (15) days after the close of each calendar month,
however, those taxes accumulated for the third month of the calendar quarter
need not be paid until the last day of the month following such quarter.  (Ord.
2014-06.  Passed 3-3-14.)
      (3)    All employers not required to make semi-monthly or monthly
payments of taxes withheld under subsections (b)(1) and (2) hereof, shall make
quarterly payments no later than the last day of the month following the end of
each quarter.
   (c)    The failure of an employer to remit to the City the tax withheld
relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded
with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (d)    Each employer who maintains a place of business in the City and
another branch within the metropolitan area of the City shall also  withhold
the tax from the employees residing in the City but working at the employer's
metropolitan area branch, even though the payroll records and place of payment
are outside the City.

thirty days extension is made to and granted by the Director of Finance or his
delegate, following any calendar year in which such deductions have been made,
or should have been made by such  employer, shall file with the Director of
Finance or his delegate an information return (Grandview Heights Withholding
Statement of Wages Paid, and Grandview Heights Income Tax Withheld), for each
employee from whom income tax has been or should have been withheld showing the
name and address of the employee,  the total amount of qualifying wages,
commissions and other compensation paid such employee during the year, and the
amount of City income tax withheld from each employee.
   (g)   Where a resident performs service for the resident's employer in
another municipality, which services are subject to withholding in  the other
municipality, the employer shall have the authority to reduce the withholding
to the City to the extent of the tax liability in the other municipality.
   (h)    All officers, members, managers, trustees, or the employees having
control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing the
report and making payment, are personally liable,  jointly and severally, for
failure to file the report or pay the tax  due as required by this section, as
well as any related interest and penalties. The dissolution, termination, or
bankruptcy of a corporation, limited liability company, business trust or
association does not discharge an officer's, member's, manager's, trustee's, 
or employee's liability for a prior failure of the corporation, limited 
liability company, business trust or association to file returns or pay tax
due.

Individuals.
   (A)     For residents of the City, the income tax levied herein shall be on
all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation
from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including the
resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned
directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident, as
further described in the definition of "income".
   (B)     For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages,
commissions, and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by
the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.

each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

deferred compensation plan.
          (3)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this

employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

                   (b)    An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile
described in division (E)(1)(a) of this section if the individual establishes
by a preponderance of the evidence that he/she was not domiciled in the City
for all or part of the taxable year.
          (2)    For the purpose of determining whether an individual is

                   (i)    The number of contact periods the individual has with
the City. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one "contact

abode located outside of the City and while away overnight from that abode
spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two consecutive days

net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the

average ratio of the following:

tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession in the City during the taxable period to the average original cost
of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer
in the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight
(8);
                 (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the
taxable period to individuals employed in the business or profession for
services performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
183.04  (C);
                 (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from
sales and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
City to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same
period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
          (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)
(1) of this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the City, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the

the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one
or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section 183.12(A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
183.12 (A).
         (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a the
Tax Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)    As used in division (F)(1)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,
and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation
paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:

described in (F)(3)(a)(ii) of this section, or a related member of such a
vendor, customer, client, or patient.
         (b)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
                 (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines
that the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
          (4)    For the purposes of division (F)(1)(c) of this section,
receipts from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to
a municipal corporation as follows:
         (a)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property

the sale of real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
         (d)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
         (e)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the City.
      (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the City's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the City or if the individual
taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the City.  The City
shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for the purpose
of calculating net profit sitused under this division to the municipal
corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   (a)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the

everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual who is a resident of the City shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's

section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (8)    Left intentionally blank.
      (9)     (a)   Upon a finding by City Council pursuant to an economic

to be located within the City;
            (2)   The new and total employment income generated;
            (3)       The tax revenue anticipated in connection with employees;

pursuant to this section from employees of the business entity.
         (e)   The tax credit may be applied against amounts that the business
entity is otherwise required to remit to the City based upon its net profits,
or refunded after collection by the City if, as a result of the credit, the
business entity has remitted to the City an amount in excess of the tax
otherwise due after application of the credit, as expressly stipulated in the
agreement. In no event shall the credit reduce the taxpayer's liability for the
tax imposed by this chapter on its net profits below zero.
         (f)   Every agreement shall state the maximum percentage of credit as
against actual receipts to the City, which shall not be exceeded in any time
period, notwithstanding any statement in the application, the agreement, or in
any other context. The agreement shall be void and unenforceable to the extent
that the tax actually collected by or remitted to the City under this section
is insufficient to cover the tax credit or any portion thereof.
         (g)       No tax credit shall exceed a term of fifteen (15) years.
         (h)     No tax credit shall be granted to a business entity without an

183.03  or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
183.01  of this Chapter, of 2.5%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that
the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively

of, the employee.   
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the City the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld
or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer,
agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the City in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the City in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded $200.
   Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made to the Tax
Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month for which
the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         (c)     Notwithstanding the provisions of Section (B)(1)(a)and (b) of
this section, taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
semimonthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld
or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the City in the preceding
calendar year exceeded $11,999, or if in any month of the preceding calendar
year exceeded $1,000.  Payment under division (B)(1)(c) of this section shall

required to be deducted and withheld after the fifteenth day of a month and
before the first day of the immediately following month, the third banking day
after the last day of the month.
      (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the IRC, 26 C.F.R.
31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the payment shall be
made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes
deducted and withheld on behalf of the City. The payment of tax by electronic
funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's, agent's, or
other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by  Tax Administrator and the City as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this Chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the City income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying

disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
                 (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer to remit to the City the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)     Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to a
the City income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
                 (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of
all employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the City during the preceding calendar year;
           (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year,;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting

      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the City income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

which an employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and
ordinary basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties
on a regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work"

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a

services performed in the City.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the City
under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the City
for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in the City.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is the City and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section

the case of a return or request by a qualified municipal corporation, Ohio Form

taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section electronically is
not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the

request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or

automatically receive an extension for the filing of the City's income tax
return. The extended due date of the City's income tax return shall be the 15th
day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is not an
extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an
extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the City's income tax return.
         (b)     A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's the City income tax return.  If
the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the City
income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's
requested extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under ORC Section 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a the City's income tax
return. The extended due date of the City's income tax return shall be the same

taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this
division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (5)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the City shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the City for a taxable
year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the City an
annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section, unless the
provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)   (a)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to [Municipality/City/Village] income
tax ordinance for a taxable year if both the following apply:

(C)(1)(g)) within [Municipality/City/Village].
            (ii)   The person no longer provides services in [Municipality/
City/Village] and does not expect to be subject to [Municipality/City/Village]

services or made any sales within [Municipality/City/Village].  The affidavit
shall also include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to
perform any services within [Municipality/City/Village], make any sales in
[Municipality/City/Village],or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by
[Municipality/City/Village] during the taxable year.  If the affiant does
become subject to the tax levied by [Municipality/City/Village] for the taxable
year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as
a taxpayer with [Municipality/City/Village] income tax ordinance and rules and
regulations."  The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)(b)
the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax return for
the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)   Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)    If a payment under this chapter is  made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment  shall be considered to be made  on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the City by an employer, the agent of an employer,
or other payer as described in Section
183.04  shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the City, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the City and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the City to be filed in accordance with this
division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the City, provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the City
or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter
and of the City's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations governing the
filing of returns, reports, or documents.
(M)    Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the City's
income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the

withholding tax returns.

civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be
filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.  However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. 
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to

otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any

taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.

tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to

that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated City income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the City. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated City
income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated City income tax

wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
          (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
183.02 (C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
          (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
183.05 , exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be
subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the

Section

entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not
be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
183.05 , exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the City income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter/ordinance on
the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated City income tax return shall make
the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
183.05  by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the City in accordance with this Chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with the City may continue to file consolidated or
combined tax returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

shall not exceed 100% of the amount obtained by multiplying the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits of other compensation subject to tax
in the other municipality by the LOWER of the tax rate in such other
municipality OR the tax rate in the City.
      (2)   FOR TAX YEARS BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2017 AND AFTER.  Every
individual taxpayer domiciled in the City who is required to and does pay, or
has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another municipality on or
measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or
other compensation taxable under this chapter, may claim a nonrefundable credit
against the tax imposed by this chapter upon satisfactory evidence that tax has
been paid to another municipality.  Subject to division (C) of this section,
the credit shall not exceed 100% of the amount obtained by multiplying the
income, qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation
subject to tax in the other municipality by the LOWER of the tax rate in such
other municipality OR the rate of 2.5%. 
         (Ord. 2016-38.  Passed 12-5-16.)
   (B)     The City shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the City who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
ORC Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72, to the same extent that it grants a
credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (C)     If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality. 
   (D)     Intentionally left blank.
(Ord. 2018-06.  Passed 2-20-18.)
183.07  ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the City's income tax for the
current taxable year.
          (2)    "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the City for the
taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and
after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from
another taxable year.
   (B)   (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld for the City from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the City in equal amounts on each payment date unless the
taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in
which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts
were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
(12) months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section
183.05  or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the City, including
the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before
the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent (45%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent (67.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    For an individual,  on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of
the first  month of the following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year.  For a person other than an individual, on or
before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of the taxable year,
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)    When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with ORC Section
183.05 .
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
183.18  upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve (12) months and the taxpayer filed a return
with the City under Section 183.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year. 
(Ord. 2018-06.  Passed 2-20-18.)
183.08  ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this Chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents ($0.50) shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any
fractional part of a dollar that is less than fifty cents ($0.50) shall be
dropped. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a document, the person
shall round all amounts entered on the document.
(Ord. 2018-06.  Passed 2-20-18.)
183.09  REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
183.18 .
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)    Overpayments of ten dollars ($10.00) or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars
($10.00) or more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter/ordinance,
requests for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form
prescribed by the Tax Administrator within three (3) years after the tax was
due or  the return was filed, whichever is later.  Tax due under this provision
includes anyone required to file an annual return, or anyone who has filed an
annual return in error. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file
with the request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for
a refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except
as provided in division (C)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall
issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or
partially denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was
denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the
assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
183.21 .
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven (7) days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
(7) days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
183.18 (A)(4).  (Ord. 2018-06.  Passed 2-20-18.)
183.10  SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the City, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City as a refund
but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the City is subject to recovery by the City.  If the
City's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a refund
of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the City shall allow
a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the City claims is due
with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to
the first municipality with respect to such income or wages. 
   (C)    If the City's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City's tax rate.  However, if the City's tax rate is greater than the tax rate
in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is
to be paid to the City, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during
the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2018-06.  Passed 2-20-18.)
183.11  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the City changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
City. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (a)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (b)    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
183.12  has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars ($10.00),
no refund need be paid by the City. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
183.09 .
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.  All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City's tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended City return showing income subject to the City
income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional the City income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars ($10.00). 
(Ord. 2018-06.  Passed 2-20-18.)
183.12  LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)    Three (3) years after the tax was due or the return was
filed, whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One (1) year after the conclusion of the qualifying
deferral period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
183.21 . That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding,
or holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth (60th) day after the date on
which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if
any party appeals from the determination of the local board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of
Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three (3) years
after the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud,
failure to file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more
of income required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six
years after the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
183.09 .
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
          (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
183.09 , with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
183.09 .
   (E)    No civil action to recover the City income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2018-06.  Passed 2-20-18.)
183.13  AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. 
(Ord. 2018-06.  Passed 2-20-18.)
183.14  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under ORC Section 5703.056.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under ORC Section 5703.056 is not
able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason
for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the
assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under ORC Section
5703.056.  With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under ORC Section
5703.056. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other the City official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
“This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten (10) days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten (10) days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by
ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within  60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City official,
or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division prevents
the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a compromise with
the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal with the local
board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations
adopted pursuant to Section
183.25  or otherwise promulgated by the Tax Administrator shall apply.
(Ord. 2018-06.  Passed 2-20-18.)
183.15  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the City that arises pursuant to the City's income tax imposed in accordance
with this Chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this chapter/ordinance prohibits a Tax Administrator from
doing either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if

memorandums, and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,
papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the
fees of officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
         (b)    The powers referred to in this division of this section shall

of the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under the City's
income tax ordinance;
      (2)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax

computations, or orders the Tax Administrator has made.
         (b)    If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or

which the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is
withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the

tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and

for the income tax levied by the City or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that

affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.

other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A person
required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information that has
experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify the Tax
Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax document
requiring the identifying information.

identifying information, nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
183.18 .
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
183.99  for a violation of Section
183.17  and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by

subject to appeal.

such appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the City at any time during their term or in the five (5) years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the Mayor

any direct subordinate thereof.
      (2)    The term for members of the Board of Tax Review shall be two

official.
      (3)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person

Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.

   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final

   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under ORC Section
149.43. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax Review created
pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body subject to ORC
Section 121.22.
   (G)     Should this Board of Tax Review become a joint body that is shared
by at least one other municipality, rules shall be adopted by the Board that
will not be in conflict with ORC Section 718.11.  Any and all rules adopted by

183.45  of the Codified Ordinances, and any applicable provision of Chapter

183.31  DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in sections
183.30  to
183.45  of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this
chapter is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States
relating to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the
use is not consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United
States relating to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the
term in Title LVII of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter
5703. of the Revised Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall
control. Any reference in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes
other laws of the United States related to federal income taxes. If a term is
defined in both this section and section
183.03  of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall
control for all uses of that term in sections
183.30  to
183.45  of the Codified Ordinances.
   As used in sections
183.30  to
183.45  of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (A)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the

C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code and
section
183.03  of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.

excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.

income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
section
183.36  of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of section
183.36  of the Codified Ordinances.
   If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (48) of section
183.03  of the Codified Ordinances, and is not a publicly traded partnership
that has made the election described in division (24)(e) of section 183.03 of
the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal taxable
income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation, except
guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a partner,

ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of sections
183.30  to
183.45  of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The

a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.

183.30  of the Codified Ordinances.
   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the

include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such

      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever

taxes are not required to be withheld under section
183.02 (C)(35) of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the City, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may require, that
the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a fairer apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of section
183.19  of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of section
183.19  of the Codified Ordinances.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the City as
follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the City  only if, regardless of where title passes, the property
meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the City from a
stock of goods located within the City.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the City from a location
outside the City, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
City to the extent that such services are performed in the City.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the City.
   (E)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the City in which
the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent or
broker shall be allocated to the City based upon the ratio of the commissions
the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
located in the City to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or
lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions of section 183.03 of the Codified Ordinances by the
City or substantially similar provision of the codified ordinances of another
municipal corporation, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from
taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City. In no
case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned
to the City any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City under this
section.
   (G)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,

183.30  of the Codified Ordinances. The tax administrator shall review these
returns and information, as well as the information received pursuant to
divisions (B) and (C) of this section, and has discretion to refer any taxpayer

prescribed by the commissioner and shall include any information that forms the
basis for the referral.
      (2)    If the tax commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the tax administrator under this section, the City reserves its right to pursue
any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure that the correct
tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.
         (Ord. 2018-06.  Passed 2-20-18.)
183.34  FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (A)   (1)    For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual

commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that

the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)    An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this

commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)    If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with section
183.01  of the Codified Ordinances, the commissioner may require taxpayers to

person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to

defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated

      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the

division (B)(1) or (2) of section
183.30  of the Codified Ordinances is binding upon the tax commissioner for the

      (5)    When an election made under section
183.30  of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations

determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner

   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
183.31  of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in
that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of section
183.31  of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
183.32  of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
183.32  of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in section
183.32  of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with sections
183.30  to
183.45  of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits
that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of
the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under section
183.32  of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit
from" appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of
corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under section  to
183.30  to
183.45  of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.

the Codified Ordinances fails to pay any tax as required under sections
183.30  to
183.45  of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before
the date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is

183.19  of the Codified Ordinances, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 2018-06.  Passed 2-20-18.)
183.38  DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under sections
183.30  to
183.45  of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year. (Ord. 2018-06.  Passed 2-20-18.)
183.39  ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by sections
183.30  to
183.45  of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code, the
following penalties shall apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under sections
183.30  to
183.45  of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax
commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the
date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under
this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
sections
183.30  to
183.45  of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner may impose
a penalty not to exceed the following:
         (a)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (b)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section
183.30  of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax
required to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty
equal to fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
sections
183.30  to
183.45  of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of sections
183.30  to
183.45  of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may
be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under sections
183.30  to
183.45  of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
section
183.09  of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
section
183.18  of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for
the assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under sections
183.30  to
183.45  of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 2018-20.  Passed 2-20-18.)
183.40  ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under section
183.30  to
183.45  of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in section
183.19  of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by sections
183.30  to
183.45  of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by section 183.19 of the Codified Ordinances, with
interest on that amount as provided by that section.  (Ord. 2018-06.  Passed 2-
20-18.)
183.41  REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under sections
183.30  to
183.45  of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of section
183.19  of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited. 
(Ord. 2018-06.  Passed 2-20-18.)
183.42  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under section
183.30  of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
sections
183.30  to
183.45  of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under section
183.19  of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
section
183.19  of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to
the requirements of that section. An application filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the
time prescribed in section
183.19  of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.
(Ord. 2018-06.  Passed 2-20-18.)
183.43  EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to sections
183.30  to
183.45  of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to sections
183.30  to
183.45  of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the tax commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.

is to be applied.
      (2)    Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the City and taxpayer under section 183(F)(9) of the Codified
Ordinances, or to modify the terms or conditions of any such existing
agreement.

   (c)   “Occupancy” means the use or possession, or the right to the use or
possession, of any room or rooms or space or portion thereof, in any hotel for
dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or the right to
use or possess any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office space,
banquet or private dining rooms, or exhibit, sample, or display space shall not
be considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition unless the person
exercising occupancy uses or possesses or has the right to use or possess, all
or any portion of such room or suite of rooms for dwelling, lodging or sleeping
purposes.
   (d)   “Operator” means any person who is the proprietor of the hotel whether
in the capacity of owner, lessee, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the
operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or
character, other than an employee, the managing agent shall be deemed an
operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and
liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by
either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered
compliance by both.
   (e)   “Person” means an individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,
association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company,
corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or
other group or combination acting as a unit.
   (f)   “Rent” means the consideration received for occupancy valued in money,
whether received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits,
and property or service of any kind or nature, and also any amount for which
the occupant is liable for the occupancy without any deduction therefrom
whatsoever.
   (g)   “Transient guests” mean persons occupying a room or rooms for sleeping
accommodations for less than thirty consecutive days.
   (h)   “Fundamental Change” means any substantial alteration by an operator
including liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy and reorganizations such as
merger, consolidation, acquisition, transfer or change in identity, form or
organization.
      (Ord. 04-35.  Passed 12-8-04.)
191.02  IMPOSITION OF TAX; EXEMPTION.
   (a)   An excise tax of three percent (3%) of the rent received by a hotel
for the providing of occupancy to transient guests is hereby imposed.  The tax
shall be placed in the Parks Capital Fund to be allocated annually by Council
for the purpose of maintaining City parks.
   (b)   In addition to the tax levied under subsection (a) hereof, there is
hereby levied an additional tax, as authorized by Ohio R.C. 5739.09, of three
percent (3%) of the rent received by a hotel for the providing of occupancy to
transient guests is hereby imposed.  Half of the revenue from this additional
tax shall be placed in a separate fund, which shall be spent solely to make
contributions to convention and visitors’ bureaus or other qualifying
organizations, operating in Franklin County.  The remaining half of the revenue
from this additional tax shall be placed in the General Fund.
   (c)   Within 30 days after the effective date of this chapter or within 30
days of commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel
renting lodging to transient guests shall register the hotel with the Director
of the Department of Finance on such form as prescribed by the Director.  The
Director will then issue a tax identification number for the City of Grandview
Heights.  It shall be the operator’s responsibility to update such registration
in the event of any fundamental change.
   (d)   No tax shall be imposed under this chapter on:
      (1)   Rents not within the taxing power of the City under the
Constitution or laws of Ohio or the United States; or
      (2)   Rents paid by the state or any of its political subdivisions.
   (e)   No exemption claimed under subsection (d) above shall be granted
except on a claim therefor made at the time the rent is collected and under
penalty of perjury on a form prescribed by the Director of the Department of
Finance.  All claims of exemption shall be made in the manner prescribed by the
Director of the Department of Finance.
   (f)   For the proper administration of this chapter and to prevent evasion
of the tax, it is presumed that all lodging furnished by hotels in this City to
transient guests is subject to the tax until the contrary is established.
(Ord. 2008-34.  Passed 3-2-09.)
191.03  TRANSIENT GUEST TO PAY TAX; PROOF OF EXEMPTION.
   (a)   The transient guest shall pay the tax imposed by this chapter to the
operator, and each operator shall collect from the transient guest the full and
exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging.
   (b)   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must
furnish to the operator, and the operator must obtain from the transient guest,
a certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
tax. If no certificate is obtained, it shall be presumed that the tax applies.
(Ord. 04-35.  Passed 12-8-04.)
191.04  REFUND OF ILLEGAL OR ERRONEOUS PAYMENTS.
   (a)   Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid
or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in
subsections (b) and (c) hereof provided a claim in writing therefore, stating
under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded,
is filed with the Director of the Department of Finance within three years of
the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Director of
the Department of Finance.
   (b)   An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Director of the Department of Finance that the person from
whom the lax has been collected was not a transient guest; provided, however,
that neither a refund nor a credit is allowed unless the amount of the tax so
collected has either been refunded to the transient guest or credited to rent
subsequently payable by the transient guest to the operator.
   (c)   A transient guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more
than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by
filing of a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a) hereof, but only
when the tax was paid by the transient guest directly to the Director of the
Department of Finance, or when the transient guest having paid the tax to the
operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the Director of the Department of
Finance that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator
who collected the tax.
   (d)   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless
the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto.
(Ord. 04-35.  Passed 12-8-04.)
191.05  RECORDS; INSPECTION; DESTRUCTION.
   Each operator shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter and shall keep all invoices, and such other pertinent
documents. If the operator furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the
operator's records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale
was exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction if
exempted for any other reason. Such records and other documents shall be opened
during business hours to the inspection of the Director of the Department of
Finance and shall be preserved for a period of seven years, unless the Director
of the Department of Finance, in writing, consents to their destruction within
that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer.
(Ord. 04-35.  Passed 12-8-04.)
191.06  RETURNS REQUIRED; PROCEDURE; FORFEIT FOR FAILURE TO FILE.
   (a)   Each operator shall, on or before the twentieth day of each month,
remit a Transient Occupancy Tax return for the preceding month by electronic
funds transfer pursuant to subsection (b).  Nothing in this subsection shall be
construed as relieving an operator from complying with subsections (b) and (c).
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the payment of taxes
by electronic funds transfer does not affect an operator’s obligation to file
as required under this section. The Director of the Department of Finance may
adopt rules governing the format for filing the returns under this section by
operators who remit undeposited taxes by electronic funds transfer. The
Director of the Department of Finance may permit the filing of returns at less
frequent intervals than required by this section if the director determines
that remittance by electronic funds transfer warrants less frequent filing of
returns.
   (c)   The Director of the Department of Finance shall adopt rules governing
the remittance of taxes by electronic funds transfer as required by this
chapter. The rules shall govern the modes of electronic funds transfer and
under what circumstances each mode is acceptable, the content and format of
electronic funds transfers, the coordination of payment by electronic funds
transfer and the filing of associated tax reports and returns, and any other
matter that in the opinion of the Director of the Department of Finance
facilitates payment by electronic funds transfer. The Director of the
Department of Finance may grant an exemption to an operator from the duty to
make payment by electronic funds transfer, upon application, for such exemption
by the operator and operators demonstration to the Director of the Department
of Finance that the requirement to make payment by electronic funds transfer
will impose a substantial hardship upon the operator. The Director of the
Department of Finance may implement means of acknowledging, upon request of the
taxpayer, receipt of tax remittances made by electronic funds transfer, and may
adopt rules governing acknowledgments. The cost of acknowledging receipt of
electronic remittances shall be paid by the person requesting acknowledgment.
   (d)   On or before January 31 of each year beginning with the year 2005,
each operator shall file a Transient Occupancy Tax annual reconciliation on a
form prescribed by the Director of the Department of Finance.  Such form shall
state the annual amount of rent received, the annual amount of rent exempted
for the preceding calendar year, and such other information as the Director may
require. Such form or forms shall be furnished by or obtainable upon request
from the Director of the Department of Finance.
   (e)   The Director of the Department of Finance may extend the time for
making and filing returns. The Director of the Department of Finance may
authorize operators whose tax liability is not such as to merit monthly
returns, as determined by the Director of the Department of Finance upon the
basis of administrative costs to the City, to make and file returns at less
frequent intervals. Such authorization shall be in writing and shall indicate
the intervals at which returns are to be filed. The Director of the Department
of Finance, if he deems it necessary in order to insure the payment of the tax
imposed by this chapter, may require returns and payments to be made for other
than monthly periods. The returns shall be transmitted by the operator or his
authorized agent.  (Ord. 04-35.  Passed 12-8-04.)
191.07  LIABILITY OF GUEST; ASSESSMENT; PETITION FOR REASSESSMENT; PENALTIES.
   (a)   If any operator collects the tax imposed by or pursuant to this
chapter and fails to remit the tax to the City as prescribed, he shall be
personally liable for any amount collected which he failed to remit. The
Director of the Department of Finance may make an assessment against the
operator based upon any information in the Director of the Department of
Finance's possession.
   (b)   If any operator fails to collect the tax or any transient guest fails
to pay the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter on any transaction
subject to the tax, such operator or transient guest shall be personally liable
for the amount of the tax applicable to the transaction. The Director of the
Department of Finance may make an assessment against either the operator or
transient guest, as the facts may require, based upon any information in his
possession.
   (c)   An assessment against an operator in cases where the tax imposed by or
pursuant to this chapter has not been collected or paid, shall not discharge
the transient guest's liability to reimburse the operator for the tax
applicable to such transaction.
   (d)   In each case the Director of the Department of Finance shall give to
the operator or transient guest an assessed written notice of the assessment.
The notice may be served upon the operator or transient guest assessed
personally or by ordinary mail. An assessment issued against either, pursuant
to the provisions of this chapter shall not be considered an election of
remedies, nor a bar to an assessment against the other for the tax applicable
to the same transaction, provided that no assessment shall be issued against
any operator or transient guest for the tax due on a particular transaction if
the tax has actually been paid by another.
   (e)   The Director of the Department of Finance may make an assessment
against any operator who fails to file a return required by this chapter or
fails to remit the proper amount of tax in accordance with this chapter. When
information in the possession of the Director of the Department of Finance
indicates that the amount required to be collected is, or should be, greater
than the amount remitted by the operator, the Director of the Department of
Finance may upon the basis of test checks of an operator's business for a
representative period which are hereby authorized, determine the ratio which
the tax required to be collected under this chapter bears to the hotel's
lodgings which determination shall be the basis of an assessment as herein
provided in this chapter. Notice of such assessment shall be made in the manner
prescribed in this chapter.
   (f)   Unless the operator or transient guest, to whom the notice of
assessment is directed, files within thirty days after service thereof, either
personally or by registered or certified mail, a petition in writing, verified
under oath by the operator, transient guest or his authorized agent having
knowledge of the facts, setting forth with particularity the items of
assessment objected to, together with the reasons for objections, the
assessment shall become conclusive and the amount thereof shall be due and
payable, from the operator or transient guest so assessed, to the Department of
Finance, City of Grandview Heights, Ohio. When a petition for reassessment is
filed, the Director of the Department of Finance shall assign a time and place
for the hearing of the petition and shall notify the petitioner thereof by
ordinary mail, but the Director of the Department of Finance may continue the
hearings from time to time if necessary.
   (g)   When any operator or transient guest files a petition for reassessment
as provided in this chapter, the assessment made by the Director of the
Department of Finance together with penalties thereon, shall become due and
payable within ten days after notice of the finding made at the hearing has
been served, either personally or by ordinary mail, upon the party assessed.
   (h)   A penalty shall be imposed on operators who are required to remit
Transient Occupancy Taxes and who fail to make such remittance by means of
electronic transfer, or who fail to utilize the required specific format, as
required under Section
191.06 (B) and (C), in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the sum which the
operator was required to remit by electronic funds transfer.
   (i)   All taxes imposed and all moneys collected or required to be collected
under the provisions of this chapter and remaining unpaid after they are due
shall be penalized as follows:
      (1)   Ten percent per month, or fraction thereof, or fifty dollars
($50.00), whichever is greater, for a first offense; or
      (2)   For a second and all subsequent offenses, ten percent per month, or
fraction thereof, or one hundred dollars ($100.00), whichever is greater.
      (3)   If the Director of the Department of Finance determines that the
nonpayment of any remittance due under this ordinance is due to fraud, a
penalty of 25% of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto, in addition to
the penalties stated in (i)(1) and (2) above.
      (4)   All taxes imposed and all moneys collected or required to be
collected by operators under the provisions of this chapter and remaining
unpaid after they become due shall bear interest at the rate of one and one-
half percent (1.5%) per month or fraction thereof together with the costs of
any collection actions, taxed and to be taxed.
   (j)   No additional penalty provided under the terms of this ordinance shall
be imposed during the pendancy of any hearing provided herein, nor during the
pendancy of any appeal to the Board of Review provided for herein. 
(Ord. 04-35.  Passed 12-8-04.)
191.08  FOUR-YEAR LIMITATION FOR ASSESSMENTS; EXCEPTIONS.
   No assessment shall be made or issued against an operator or transient guest
for any tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter more than four years after
the return date for the period in which the lodging was furnished or more than
four years after the return for such period is filed, whichever is later. This
division does not bar an assessment:
   (a)   When the Director of the Department of Finance has substantial
evidence of amounts of taxes collected by an operator from transient guest's
lodging which were not returned to the City;
   (b)   When an assessed operator failed to file a return as required.
      (Ord. 04-35.  Passed 12-8-04.)
191.09  TAX TO BE PAID BY TRANSIENT GUEST; FALSE EVIDENCE OF TAX-EXEMPT STATUS
PROHIBITED.
   No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full and exact tax as required by
this chapter; no transient guest shall present false evidence to the operator
indicating that the lodging as furnished is not subject to the tax. 
(Ord. 04-35.  Passed 12-8-04.)
191.10  OPERATOR TO COLLECT TAX; REBATE PROHIBITED.
   (a)   No operator shall fail to collect the full and exact tax as required
by this chapter. No operator shall refund, remit or rebate to a transient
guest, either directly or indirectly, any of the tax levied pursuant to this
chapter, or make in any form of advertising, verbal or otherwise any statements
which might imply that he is absorbing the tax, or paying the tax for the
transient guest by an adjustment of prices, or furnishing lodging at a price
including the tax, or rebating the tax in any other manner.
   (b)   Each operator in collecting Transient Occupancy Tax shall be deemed to
hold the same, until payment is made by such operator to the Department of
Finance, as a Trustee for the benefit of the City of Grandview Heights and any
such Transient Occupancy Tax collected by such operator, shall, until the same
is paid to the Director of the Department of Finance, be deemed a trust fund in
the hands of such operator. All returns and payments submitted by the operator
shall be treated as confidential by the Director of the Department of Finance
and shall not be released by him except on order of a court of competent
jurisdiction or to an officer or agent of the United States, the state, the
county or the city for official use only.
   (c)   Whoever violates this confidentiality shall be guilty of a misdemeanor
of the first degree. 
(Ord. 04-35.  Passed 12-8-04.)
191.11  RETURN MUST BE FILED; PROCEDURE IN A FAILURE TO FILE.
   (a)   No person, including any officer of a corporation or employee of a
corporation having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility
of filing returns, shall fail to file any return or report required to be filed
by this chapter, or file or cause to be filed any incomplete, false or
fraudulent return, report or statement, or aid or abet another in the filing of
any false or fraudulent return, report or statement.
   (b)   If any operator required to file monthly returns under this chapter
fails, in two consecutive months or in three or more months within a twelve-
month period, to file such returns when due or to pay the tax thereon, or if
any operator authorized by the Director of the Department of Finance to file
returns at less frequent intervals, fails on two or more occasions within a
twenty-four month period, to file such returns when due or to pay the tax due
thereon, the Director of the Department of Finance may require such operator to
furnish security in an amount equal to the average tax liability of the
operator for a period of one year, as determined by the Director of the
Department of Finance from a review of returns or other information pertaining
to such operator, which amount shall in no event be less than one hundred
dollars ($100.00). The security may be in the form of an advance tax payment to
be applied to pay the tax due on subsequent returns, or a corporate surety bond
satisfactory to the Director of the Department of Finance, conditioned upon
payment of the tax due with the returns from the operator. The security must be
filed within ten days following the operator's receipt of the notice from the
Director of the Department of Finance of its requirements.    
   (c)   A corporate surety bond filed under this section shall be returned to
the operator if, for a period of twelve consecutive months following the date
the bond was filed, the operator has filed all returns and remitted payment
therewith within the time prescribed in this chapter.
(Ord. 04-35.  Passed 12-8-04.)
191.12  PERSONAL LIABILITY OF CORPORATE OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES.
   If any operator required to file returns and to remit tax due to the City
under the provisions of this chapter fails for any reason to make such filing
or payment, any of its officers or employees having control or supervision of
or charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making payments shall
be personally liable for such failure. The dissolution of a corporation shall
not discharge an officer or employee's liability for a prior failure of the
corporation to file returns or remit tax due. Returns and payments are due
immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. The sum due for such
liability may be collected by assessment in the manner provided in this
Chapter. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this
chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for
recovery of the amount due plus assessments together with the costs of this
action, taxed and to be taxed.
(Ord. 04-35.  Passed 12-8-04.)
191.13  RETURNED CHECKS.
   Checks or electronic transactions returned to the City for insufficient
funds, or other reasons, will be charged a twenty-five dollar ($25.00) handling
fee. A second check or electronic transaction returned to the City for
insufficient funds, or other reasons, will be charged a fifty dollar ($50.00)
handling fee and the City will require all non-electronic payments to be made
by currency, bank check or money order only. 
(Ord. 04-35.  Passed 12-8-04.)
 
191.14  OBJECTIONS; APPEALS; HEARINGS.
   (a)   Unless the vendor or transient guest to whom the notice of assessment
is directed, files within thirty days after service thereof, either personally
or by registered or certified mail a petition in writing, verified under oath
by the vendor, transient guest or his authorized agent, having knowledge of the
facts, setting forth with particularity the items of the assessment objected
to, together with the reasons for such objections, such assessment shall become
conclusive and the amount thereof shall be due and payable, from the vendor or
transient guests so assessed, to the Director of the Department of Finance.
When a petition for reassessment is filed, the Director shall assign a time and
place for the hearing of same and shall notify the petitioner thereof by
registered or certified mail, but the Director may continue the hearings from
time to time if necessary.
   (b)   Any vendor or transient guest aggrieved by any decision may appeal to
the Mayor by filing a notice of appeal with him within fifteen days of the
serving or mailing of the determination of the tax due. The Mayor shall fix a
time and place for hearing the appeal, and shall give notice in writing to the
vendor at his last known place of address. The findings of the Mayor shall be
final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner
prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due
shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.   
(Ord. 04-35.  Passed 12-8-04.)
191.15  INTENT.
   It is the intent of this chapter to levy the Transient Occupancy Tax of six
percent on transactions by which lodging by a hotel is or is to be furnished to
transient guests as referred to and authorized by Ohio R.C. 5739. Accordingly,
this chapter shall be construed to effectuate that purpose and so as to be
consistent with any requirement of law compliance with which is a prerequisite
to the validity of the tax intended to be levied hereby.
(Ord. 04-35.  Passed 12-8-04.)
191.16  SEVERABILITY.    
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter or any tax imposed
as specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter and shall not affect or impair any of
the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other parts of this
chapter.  It is hereby declared to be the intention of Council that this
chapter would have been adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid
sentence, clause, section or part thereof not been included herein. 
(Ord. 04-35.  Passed 12-8-04.)
191.99  PENALTY.    
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor of the first degree.

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee.  However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in
rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items
after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the
notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if applicable.  The
owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
sheriff or chief of police, as applicable, to be necessary to a criminal
investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (3)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.

from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;

the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign  a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner.  If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private

without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service.  The towing service shall

with this section, within three days of the removal, the towing service or
storage facility from which the vehicle may be recovered shall cause a search
to be made of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain the
identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle.  The Registrar
of Motor Vehicles shall insure that such information is provided in a timely
manner.  Subject to subsection (f)(4) of this section, the towing service or
storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
         A.   Within five business days after the Registrar of Motor Vehicles
provides the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle, if

303.10  LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with

property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,

or shall be removed from the property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section. 
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of

offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the

the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00),
the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course,
the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio Director of
Public Safety.  If the offender attends and successfully completes the course,
the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course.  The offender shall be required to pay the total amount

to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section.  If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.  It is
an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the traffic control
device was not placed in accordance with the provisions of this Traffic Code.
   (b)   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall
be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.  Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.

313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

313.03  TRAFFIC  SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05 , pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05  or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05  or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)

being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used.  (ORC 4511.14)

      (3)   Subsection (d)(2)A.3. of this section does not apply to a person
who is in physical control of a vehicle while the person has a concentration of
a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or

vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of

person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any

to the person to be tested, as required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state
that the person may have an independent test performed at the person’s
expense.  The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all

sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other

         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense

The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under

As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and
to determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.

affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or

that the holder has in the holder’s immediate possession written documentation
from an appropriate official of the school;
            3.   Traveling to or from an official religious event between the
hours of one a.m. and five a.m., provided that the holder has in the holder’s

      (3)   An employer, school official or official affiliated with a
religious event is not liable in damages in a civil action for any injury,
death or loss to person or property that allegedly arises from, or is related
to, the fact that the employer, school official, or official affiliated with a
religious event provided the holder of a  probationary driver’s license with
the written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section.
The Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall make available at no cost a form to serve
as the written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section,

member occupying the vehicle unless the probationary license holder is
accompanied by the probationary license holder’s parent, guardian or custodian.
   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or

attaining the age of seventeen years and the person pleads guilty to, is
convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving
violation during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the
person is issued the probationary driver’s license, the court with jurisdiction
over the violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle
upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking for a period not to exceed six months
or the date the holder attains the age of seventeen years, whichever occurs

under subsection (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for driving privileges without being accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection.  In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted.  If a person is convicted of,
pleads guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a
second or subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the
violation may terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this
division.
      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under

occupant restraining device.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or
is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for such a violation or for causing the arrest of or commencing a
prosecution of a person for such violation.

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct.  However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license

not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When the offense is an

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section.  The
person charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may

in the database under subsection (c)(5) of this section is not a public record
subject to inspection or copying under Ohio R.C. 149.43.
   (d)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on
any street or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (b) hereof has been or is being
committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or summons for
a violation of that nature or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution
of a person for a violation of that nature, and no law enforcement officer
shall view the interior or visually inspect any automobile being operated on
any street or highway for the sole purpose of determining whether a violation
of that nature has been or is being committed.
   (e)   All fines collected for violations of subsection (b) hereof shall be
forwarded to the Treasurer of State for deposit as provided in Ohio R.C.
4513.263.
   (f)   (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(2) of this section, the failure of a
person to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant
restraining device in violation of subsection (b)(1) or (3) or the failure of a
person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an automobile being
operated by that person is wearing all of the available elements of a properly
adjusted occupant restraining device, in violation of subsection (b)(2)  of
this section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort
action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.  But the trier of
fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of
evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action
and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic
loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.  Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.     It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the
occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   (1)   Whoever violates subsection (b)(1) of this section shall be
fined thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates subsection (b)(3) of this section shall be fined
twenty dollars ($20.00).
      (3)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates
subsection (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
subsection (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates subsection (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

this section by a bicycle operator, electric bicycle operator, or motor vehicle
operator when the trier of fact finds that the violation by the motor vehicle
operator endangered the lives of bicycle riders or electric bicycle riders at
the time of the violation, the court, notwithstanding any provision of this
Traffic Code to the contrary, may require the bicycle operator, electric
bicycle operator or motor vehicle operator to take and successfully complete a
bicycling skills course approved by the court in addition to or in lieu of any
penalty otherwise prescribed by the Traffic Code for that violation.

other than while sitting astride the saddle, facing forward, with one leg on
each side of the motorcycle.
   (e)   No person shall ride upon a motorcycle that is equipped with a seat
other than while sitting upon the seat.
   (f)   No person operating a bicycle or electric bicycle shall carry any
package, bundle or article that prevents the driver from keeping at least one
hand upon the handlebars.
   (g)   No bicycle, electric bicycle, or motorcycle shall be used to carry
more persons at one time than the number for which it is designed and
equipped.  No motorcycle shall be operated on a highway when the handlebars
rise higher than the shoulders of the operator when the operator is seated in
the operator’s seat or saddle.
   (h)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (h)(2) of this section, no
person shall operate or be a passenger on a snowmobile or motorcycle without
using safety glasses or other protective eye device.  Except as provided in
subsection (i)(3) of this section, no person who is under the age of eighteen
years, or who holds a motorcycle operator's endorsement or license bearing
"novice" designation that is currently in effect as provided in Ohio R.C.
4507.13, shall operate a motorcycle on a highway, or be a passenger on a
motorcycle, unless wearing a United States Department of Transportation-
approved protective helmet on the person’s head, and no other person shall be a
passenger on a motorcycle operated by such a person unless similarly wearing a
protective helmet.  The helmet, safety glasses or other protective eye device
shall conform with rules adopted by the Ohio Director of Public Safety.  The
provisions of this subsection or a violation thereof shall not be used in the
trial of any civil action. 
      (2)   Subsection (h)(1) of this section does not apply to a person
operating an autocycle or cab-enclosed motorcycle when the occupant compartment
top is in place enclosing the occupants.
   (i)   (1)   No person shall operate a motorcycle with a valid temporary
permit and temporary instruction permit identification card issued by the Ohio
Registrar of Motor Vehicles pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4507.05 unless the person, at
the time of such operation, is wearing on the person’s head a protective helmet
that has been approved by the United States Department of Transportation that

with the chin strap securely fastened under the chin. Such helmet shall be
appropriately fitted to the size of the operator and shall meet or exceed the
standards set by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).  The
CPSC's safety standards support the American Academy of Pediatrics' conclusion
that infants (children under age 1) should not be passengers on a bicycle under
any circumstance.  The weight of children's helmets makes them unsuitable for
use on infants' heads. This subsection shall not apply to any person operating
a bicycle or riding as a passenger on such device on private residential
property.
      (2)   No parent, guardian, or legal custodian shall permit a person under
the age of eighteen (18) years to violate this subsection.

not wearing a helmet.  The police may take possession of the bicycle and hold
it until the parent, guardian, or legal custodian claims the bicycle and is
informed by the police of the violation and of the severe injuries which may
result.
      (4)   It shall be an affirmative defense to the first violation of this
section that the parent, guardian, or legal custodian provides the City with
proof of ownership of a protective helmet that is appropriately fitted to the
size of the operator and that meets or exceed the standards set by the U.S.
Consumer Product Safety Commission at or prior to the time for paying a
citation or appearing in Mayor's Court, as further set forth in
373.99 (b).
      (5)   Failure to wear a protective helmet as required in subsection shall
not be considered to be comparative or contributory negligence on the part of
the parent, guardian, custodian, person having custody or control, or person in
loco parentis of a child nor on the part of the child nor shall such failure be
admissible in any civil action.
   (k)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the
carrying of a child in a seat or trailer that is designed for carrying children
and is firmly attached to the bicycle.

offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is

case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the

Municipality for purposes of this section.

501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section 501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
 
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.     
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. 
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
 
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
 
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and  require that it be weighed with great caution.
   “It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
501.13  RECOVERY OF INCARCERATION COSTS.
   (a)   Pursuant to the sections of the Ohio Revised Code that are recited in
the preamble hereto, which are incorporated by reference, the legislative
authority of the municipal corporation, the City of Grandview Heights, Ohio,
does hereby require any person who is convicted of an offense other than a
minor misdemeanor and is sentenced to confinement in the County Jail to
reimburse the City for its expenses incurred by reason of the offender's
confinement, including, but not limited to, the expenses relating to the
provision of food, clothing, and shelter.  Such reimbursement shall include
expenses for preconviction confinement when credit for such confinement is
credited against the term of imprisonment.
   (b)   The amount of the reimbursement required by this section shall be
determined by the court after a hearing held pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.15, or
any subsequent amendment thereto.  The amount of the reimbursement ordered by
the court shall not exceed the actual costs of the confinement or forty dollars
($40.00) for each day of confinement, whichever is less.  The Court shall
consider all factors that affect the offender's financial ability to make
reimbursement to the City.  When the Municipal Court or Mayor's Court makes a
reimbursement determination pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.15, a judgment entry and
order of reimbursement shall be filed and entered that sets forth the total
amount of reimbursement due to the City, and the reimbursement schedules and
methods.
   (c)   This section shall not apply to offenders that the court finds to be
indigent.
   (d)   Funds that are reimbursed to the City pursuant to this section shall
be paid into the General Fund of the City treasury.
   (e)   If an offender does not pay to the City the reimbursement ordered by
the court pursuant to this section, the City Attorney may collect that claim or
institute an appropriate civil action in the name of the City in the Franklin
County Common Pleas Court to recover from the convict the reimbursement for the
expenses of confinement as determined by the court.  If an action is filed it
shall be brought not later than one year after the person is released from
incarceration.  If it is deemed in the best interests of the City, the City
Attorney is authorized to compromise and settle such claim in an amount less
than the total reimbursement due to the City.  If an offender does not comply
with the reimbursement determination for expenses of confinement made by the
Court, then the convict is deemed to be acting in bad faith, vexatiously,
wantonly, and obdurately and in any civil action on behalf of the City to
recover from the convict the reimbursement for the expenses of his confinement
the City Attorney or his representative shall request an award of attorney fees
as part of the costs of the proceedings.  The award of such attorney fees shall
be paid into the General Fund of the City treasury.
(Ord. 91-38.  Passed 12-2-91.)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
         All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of
economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the
victim against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the
restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and
processing restitution payments.
         The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case
file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the
payment terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it
may modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of                          Maximum
Misdemeanor                      Fine
First degree                       $ 5000.00
Second degree                 4000.00
Third degree                     3000.00
Fourth degree                 2000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically    2000.00
      classified
Minor misdemeanor not            1000.00
      specifically classified
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

533.01  DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another.  Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if
such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or
gratifying either person.
   (c)   "Sexual activity" means sexual conduct or sexual contact, or both.
   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
sexual activity, masturbation, sexual excitement or nudity in a way which tends
to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite;
      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which
inspires disgust or revulsion in persons with ordinary sensibilities, without
serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to
prurient or scatological interest, when the appeal to such interest is
primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than
primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.
   (g)   "Sexual excitement" means the condition of human male or female
genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.
   (h)   "Nudity" means the showing, representation or depiction of human male

541.01  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
 
   (c)   Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
 
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall

545.02  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
 545.05,  or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
 545.05 ,

545.08 ,
545.10 (b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20  involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05 , or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05  or
545.15  involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05  that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08 , Section
545.10 (b)(1) or (2), or Section
 545.15  or
545.20 , whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense.  If the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or

545.05  or
545.15 , whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,

duty service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those
offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a
single offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose
of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series. 
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

benefit and impact upon the people of Grandview Heights. Because of the complex

be served by establishing regulatory powers which should be vested in the City
or such persons as the City shall designate. It is the intent of this chapter
and subsequent amendments to provide for and specify the means to attain the
best possible public interest and public purpose in these matters and any
Permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed to include this finding
as an integral part thereof.
   (b)   Further, it is recognized that Cable Systems and Competitive Video
Systems have the capacity to provide not only entertainment and information
services to the City's residents, but can provide a variety of broadband,
interactive communications services to institutions and individuals. Many of
these services involve City agencies and other public institutions by providing
governmental, educational or health care communications.
   (c)   For these purposes, the following goals underlie the regulations
contained herein:
      (1)   Telecommunications services should be provided to the maximum
number of  City residents.
      (2)   The Cable Systems and Competitive Video Systems should be capable
of accommodating both the present and reasonably foreseeable future
communications needs of the City, taking into account technical and financial
feasibility.
      (3)   The Cable Systems and Competitive Video Systems should be improved
and upgraded during the Permit term, taking into account the technical and
financial feasibility of such improvements and upgrades so that the new
facilities necessary for the operation of the Cable System and Competitive
Video Systems shall be integrated to the maximum extent possible with existing
facilities as provided for in this chapter and the Permit.
      (4)   The Cable Systems and Competitive Video Systems authorized by this
chapter shall be responsive to the needs and interests of the local community,
and shall provide the widest possible diversity of information sources and
services to the public, taking into account technical and financial
feasibility.

(Ord. 2007-13.  Passed 6-18-07.)
705.03  GRANT OF A PERMIT.
   (a)   Grant.
      (1)   Communication firms are eligible to provide either Cable Service or
Competitive Video Service.  By electing to provide Cable Service, a
communications firm is precluded from providing competitive video service in
the City. By electing to provide Competitive Video Service, a communications
firm is precluded from providing Cable Service in the City.  Existing Cable
Franchises shall remain in full force and effect until the end of their term,
at which time the Provider can elect to continue to be a Cable Service or opt
to become a Competitive Video Service.
In the event that Grantor shall grant to the Provider a nonexclusive, revocable
Permit to construct, operate, and maintain a Cable System or Competitive Video
System within the City, said Permit shall constitute both a right and an
obligation to provide Cable Service or Competitive Video Service as regulated
by the provisions of City Ordinances including, but not limited to, Chapters
705 and
905 of the Codified Ordinances and the Permit.
      (2)   The Permit shall be granted under the terms and conditions
contained herein, consistent with the City's Charter and/or other applicable
statutory requirements. In the event of conflict between the terms and
conditions of this chapter, the Permit, or the terms and conditions on which
Grantor can grant a Permit, the Charter and/or statutory requirements shall
control.
      (3)   Any Permit granted by Grantor is hereby made subject to the general
ordinance provisions now in effect and hereafter made effective. Nothing in the
Permit shall be deemed to waive the requirements of the various codes and
ordinances of the City regarding permit, fees to be paid, or manner of
construction.
   (b)   Permit Area. The Permit Area shall be the entire City, or designated
portions thereof, for which a Permit is granted.
   (c)   Use of Public Rights of Way. For the purpose of operating and
maintaining a Cable System or Competitive Video System in the City, the
Provider may erect, install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct and retain
in, on, over, under, upon, across and along the Public Ways within the City
such wires, cable, conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers,
appliances, pedestals, attachments and other property and equipment as are
necessary to the operation of the Cable Communications System, provided,
however, that Provider complies with all design, construction, safety, and
performance provisions contained in this chapter, the Permit, and other
applicable local ordinances.
   (d)   Use of Provider Facilities. No poles shall be erected by the Provider
without prior approval of the City with regard to location, height, type and
any other pertinent aspect. However, no location of any pole of the Provider
shall be a vested right and such poles shall be removed or modified within a
reasonable period of time by the Provider at its own expense whenever the City
determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. The Provider
shall utilize existing poles and conduits, where possible. The City shall have
the right, during the life of the Permit, to install and maintain upon the
poles owned by the Provider, any wire and pole fixtures that do not
unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Provider. City shall fully
defend, indemnify and hold Provider harmless from any cause of action that
might arise from or be due to actions or omissions by the City when it is
involved in the private use of the Provider's poles.
   (e)   Permit Required. No Cable System or Competitive Video System shall be
allowed to occupy or use the streets of the City or be allowed to operate
without a Permit pursuant to this Chapter.
   (f)   Term of Permit. The term of any Permit granted pursuant to this
chapter shall be stated in the Permit.
   (g)   Permit Nonexclusive. Any Permit granted pursuant to this chapter shall
be nonexclusive. Grantor specifically reserves the right to (1) grant at any
time such additional Permits for Cable Systems or Competitive Video Systems as
it deems appropriate, and/or (2) build, operate, and own such Cable
Communication System or Competitive Video System as it deems appropriate.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, however, no such Permit shall be
granted on terms or conditions other than in accordance with federal and state
law and which, when taken as a whole, are materially more favorable or less
burdensome than those imposed upon any other Provider hereunder.
   (h)   Time is of the Essence to this Agreement. Whenever an Ordinance shall
set forth any time for an act to be performed by or on behalf of the Provider,
such time shall be deemed of the essence and any failure of the Provider to
perform within the time allotted shall always be sufficient ground for the City
to invoke an appropriate penalty including possible revocation of the Permit.
   (i)   Law Governs. In any controversy or dispute under this Ordinance, the
law of the State of Ohio shall apply.
   (j)   Severability.
      (1)   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of
this chapter or the Permit is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional
by any court of competent jurisdiction, or preempted or superseded by any
Federal or State statute or regulation, such portion shall be deemed a
separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding or preemption
shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof;
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter to the
contrary, the Provider shall at all times comply with all laws and regulations
of the state and federal government. In the event that any actions of the State
or Federal government or any agency thereof, or any court of competent
jurisdiction upon final adjudication, substantially reduce in any way the power
or authority of the City under this chapter or the Permit, or if in compliance
with any State or Federal law or regulation, the Provider finds conflict with
the terms of this chapter, the Permit, or any law or regulation of the City,
then as soon as possible following knowledge thereof, the Provider shall notify
the City of the point of conflict believed to exist between such law or
regulation and the laws or regulations of the City, this chapter and the
Permit.
   (k)   Transfer of Ownership or Control.
      (1)   Transfer of Permit. Any Permit granted hereunder shall not be
sold,transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of, including but not limited
to, transfer by force or voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, receivership or
other means, nor shall the control of the Provider be changed, without the
prior consent of the City, and then only under such conditions related to the
qualifications of the transferee, as the City may establish.
      (2)   The Provider shall promptly notify the City of any actual or
proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of,
control of the Provider. The word "control" as used herein shall apply to the
sale or transfer of all or a majority of the Operator's assets, merger
(including any parent and its subsidiary corporation), consolidation, creation
of a subsidiary corporation or sale or transfer of stock in the Operator so as
to create a new controlling interest. The term "controlling interest" as used
herein is not limited to majority stock ownership, but includes actual working
control in whatever manner exercised.
      (3)   Every transfer, or acquisition of control of the Provider shall
make thePermit subject to cancellation unless and until the City, for those
transactions requiring City approval, shall have consented thereto, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining
whether it shall consent to a transfer or acquisition of control, the City may
inquire into the legal, financial, character, technical qualifications and the
experience of the prospective controlling party, and the Provider shall assist
the City in any such inquiry. Failure to provide all material information
reasonably requested by the City as part of said inquiry may be grounds for
denial of the proposed change, transfer or acquisition of control.
      (4)   Assumption of Control. The City agrees that any financial
institution having a pledge of the Permit or its assets for the advancement of
money for the construction and/or operation of the Permit shall have the right
to notify the City that it or its designees satisfactory to the City will take
control and operate the Cable System or Competitive Video System. Further, said
financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation that will
insure continued service and compliance with all Permit obligations during the
term the financial institution exercises control over the Cable System or
Competitive Video System. The financial institution shall not exercise control
over the System for a period exceeding one year, unless extended by the City at
its discretion and during said period of time it shall have the right to
petition for transfer of the Permit to another Provider. If the City finds that
such transfer, after considering the legal, financial, character, technical
qualifications and the experience of the applicant are satisfactory, the City
will approve the transfer and assignment of the rights and obligations of such
Permit as in the public interest. The consent of the City to such transfer
shall not be unreasonably withheld.
      (5)   The consent or approval of the City to any transfer of the Permit
shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the City in and to
the streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subject to the
terms and conditions of this chapter and the Permit.
      (6)   Any approval by the City of transfer of ownership or control shall
be contingent upon the prospective controlling party becoming a signatory to
the Permit.
      (7)   The City shall act upon any transfer or acquisition of control
requiring City approval in compliance with federal law governing municipal
approval of such transfers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no such
prior consent shall be required for a transfer or assignment to any person
controlling, controlled by or under the same common control as the Provider.
   (l)   Permit Renewal. Upon completion of the term of any Permit granted
under this chapter, Grantor may grant or deny renewal of the Permit of the
Provider in accordance with the provisions of the Cable Act and this Chapter.
The Provider shall own the Cable System or Competitive Video System, but shall
have no property right in the public rights of way upon the completion of the
Permit term.
   (m)   Police Powers.
      (1)   In accepting the Permit, the Provider acknowledges that its rights
hereunder are subject to the police power of the City to adopt and enforce
general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public; and it
agrees to comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the
City pursuant to such power.
      (2)   Any conflict between the provisions of this chapter or the Permit
and any other present or future lawful exercise of the City's police powers
shall be resolved in favor of the latter, except that any such exercise that is
not of general application in the City or applies exclusively to Provider which
contains provisions inconsistent with this Ordinance shall prevail only if,
upon such exercise, the City finds an emergency exists constituting a danger to
health, safety, property or general welfare and such exercise is mandated by
law.
   (n)   Permit Fees.
      (1)   Fee. The Provider of any Permit hereunder shall pay to the City a
Permit fee in an amount as designated by the City up to five percent (5%) of
the Gross Annual Revenues. The Permit payment shall be in addition to any other
fee and shall commence as of the effective date of the Permit. The City shall
be furnished a statement of said payment by an officer of the Provider,
reflecting the total amounts of Gross Annual Revenues and the above charges and
computations for the period covered by the payment.
      (2)   Permit fee in addition to other tax or payment. This payment shall
be in addition to any other tax or payment owed to the City by the Provider.
Payment of the Permit Fee made by Provider to the City shall not be considered
in the nature of a tax, but shall be in addition to any and all taxes which are
now or may be required hereafter to be paid by any Federal, State, or Local
law.
      (3)   Acceptance by the City. No acceptance of any payment by the City
shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim
the City may have for further or additional sums payable as a Permit Fee under
this Ordinance or for the performance of any other obligation of the Provider.
      (4)   Failure to make required payment. In the event that any Permit Fee
payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified
herein Provider shall pay as additional compensation an interest charge,
computed from such due date, at the annual rate equal to the commercial prime
interest rate of the City primary depository bank during the period that such
unpaid amount is owed.
      (5)   Payments to be made quarterly. The Permit Fee and any other cost or
damage assessed against the Provider shall be payable quarterly to the City.
The Provider shall file a complete and accurate verified statement of all Gross
Annual Revenues within the Permit area during the period for which said
quarterly payment is made, and said payment shall be made to the City no later
than forty-five (45) days following the end of each calendar quarter. Quarterly
computation dates are the last day in the months of March, June, September and
December.
      (6)   The City's right of inspection. The City shall have the right to
inspect the Provider's income records and the right to audit and to recompute
any amounts determined to be payable under this chapter. Any additional amount
due the City as a result of the audit shall be paid within thirty (30) days
following written notice to the Provider by the City which notice shall include
a copy of the audit report.
   (o)   Forfeiture or Revocation.
      (1)   Grounds for revocation. The City reserves the right to revoke any
Permit granted hereunder and rescind all rights and privileges associated with

shall not be declared at fault or be subject to any sanction under any
provision of this Ordinance in any case, in which performance of any such
provision is prevented or delayed due to a Force Majeure.
      (3)   Litigation. Pending litigation or any appeal to any regulatory body
or court having jurisdiction over the Provider shall not excuse the Provider
from the performance of its obligations under this chapter or the Permit unless
a stay is granted. Failure of the Provider to perform such obligations because
of pending litigation or petition may result in forfeiture or revocation
pursuant to the provisions of this section.
      (4)   Procedure prior to revocation.
         A.   The City shall make written demand that the Provider does so
comply with any such requirement, limitation, term condition, rule or
regulation or correct any action deemed cause for revocation. If the failure,
refusal or neglect of the Provider continues for a period of thirty days
following such written demand, the City shall place its request for termination
of the Permit upon a regular Council meeting agenda. The City shall cause to be
served upon such Provider at least seven days prior to the date of such Council
meeting, a written notice of this intent to request such termination, and the
time and place of the meeting, notice of which shall be published by the Clerk
of Council at least once, seven days before such meeting in a newspaper of
general circulation within the City. The time for the Provider to correct any
alleged violation shall be extended by the City, if the necessary action to
correct the alleged violation is of such a nature or character to require more
then thirty days within which to perform, provided the Provider provides a plan
reasonably acceptable to the City and the Provider commences the corrective
action within the thirty day period and thereafter uses its best efforts to
correct the violation.
         B.   The Council shall hear any persons interested therein, and shall
determine whether or not any failure, refusal or neglect by the Provider was
with just cause.

cause, as defined by the City, the Council shall direct the Provider to comply
within such time and manner and upon such terms and conditions as are
reasonable.
         D.   If the Council shall determine such failure, refusal, or neglect
by the Provider was without just cause, then the Council shall, by resolution,
declare that the Permit of the Provider shall be terminated and the performance
bond forfeited unless there is compliance by the Provider within a specified
period of time not to exceed ninety days.

opportunity to cure, cause such work to be done and the Provider shall
reimburse the City the cost thereof within thirty days after receipt of an

   (a)   All driveways, public or private, abutting upon and with ingress and
egress to a public street, except an alley, shall be constructed of cement to a
minimum of six inches, beginning at the curb line of the street extending to
the edge of the sidewalk closest to the property line.  If there is no
sidewalk, the driveway shall extend at least twelve feet in length from the
curb line of the street and shall be constructed of an impervious material
(i.e. macadam, asphalt, asphaltic concrete, paving brick) to a minimum of six
inches.  The remaining portion of a driveway shall be constructed of an
impervious material or a pervious material such as marble chips or gravel, to a
minimum depth of four inches.  If constructed of a pervious material, a border
made of material sufficient to clearly define the driveway from any adjacent
lawn areas shall exist at all times.  Such border shall also prevent the spread
of construction materials to adjacent lawn areas and vice versa.  The border
material shall be subject to the approval of the Director of Building and
Zoning.  Any driveway not constructed of an impervious or pervious material
pursuant to these requirements is a nuisance and must conform by October 1,
1995.  Driveways defined by this section between the street to the rear
building line per property shall not exceed a width of ten feet.  Curb cuts for
such driveways shall be a minimum of twelve feet wide, not to exceed sixteen
feet.  These size requirements shall not be applied retroactively to existing
driveways constructed of an impervious or pervious material.
   (b)   All driveways, public or private, abutting upon and with ingress and
egress to an alley shall be constructed of an impervious material as required
above, or a pervious material such as marble chips or gravel, to a minimum
depth of four inches.  If constructed of a pervious material, a border made of
material sufficient to clearly define the driveway from any adjacent lawn areas
shall exist at all times.  Such border shall also prevent the spread of
construction materials to adjacent lawn areas and vice versa.  The border
material shall be subject to the approval of the Director of Building and
Zoning.
   (c)   Adjacent street surfaces and sidewalks shall be kept free of driveway
construction material and other debris.
(Ord.  94-24.  Passed 8-1-94.)
917.03  FAILURE TO COMPLY; CONSTRUCTION BY CITY.
   Any property owner failing to comply with the terms of Section
917.02 after ten days notice by the Director of Public Service, such Director
is hereby authorized to proceed with the necessary labor and materials to
construct that portion of the driveway provided for in this chapter.  A record
of the cost of labor and material shall be maintained.  Upon completion or
installation, a statement bill or charge for the cost plus ten percent (10%)
shall issue to the property owner thereof and failure to pay the same within
ten days thereof, such cost plus ten percent (10%) shall be and hereby is
assessed to the property so improved, and the Director of Public Service is
hereby authorized to forward such assessment to the Auditor of Franklin County
for collection in the same manner as is provided for street improvements.
(Ord. 40-60.  Passed 11-7-60.)
917.04  PROTECTION OF CURBS; OTHER PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   Before commencing the construction, enlargement, alteration, repair or
removal of any building or other structure, or the excavation therefore, in
which it is desired or may be necessary to drive across the curb, tree lawn or
sidewalk, the person obtaining the permit shall cut the curb for a sufficient
width at the location of the contemplated permanent driveway so as to prevent
damage to the remainder of the curb, and if there is no curbing, he shall
install in the ditch paralleling the street, tile of sufficient size to prevent
the backing up of water in the ditch and shall cover such tile with crushed
stone or gravel to the level of the existing road for a width sufficient to
allow trucks carrying building supplies to pass over.  Thereafter no vehicle
shall be driven across the curb, tree lawn, sidewalk or ditch except by way of
such curb cut and proposed driveway.  Such person shall take such further
action as may be necessary to prevent the formation of ruts, depressions or
other obstacles or hazards to pedestrian travel along the tree lawn or
sidewalk.  All of such work shall be done under the supervision and to the
satisfaction of the Director of Building and Zoning, who shall have the
authority to determine the width, depth and manner of cutting the curb or
laying tile and the type of protection of the sidewalk and tree lawn.
   (b)   All provisions for the cut of the curb provided for herein shall be
subject to the fees provided by Council.
   (c)   Before commencing the construction, alteration or repair of any such
building or other structure or the excavation therefor, the owner shall
construct a driveway of gravel or crushed stone from the curb extending to the
farthest point where building materials will be unloaded.  When such structure
is completed, such driveway shall be completed in compliance with Section
917.06.

requested, whether original or for alteration or modification of any building
that requires a driveway and/or a parking area for vehicles, it shall not be
issued unless such plans accompanying the application provide for a hard
surface of asphalt, asphaltic concrete, macadam, macadam composition, or brick
on all driveways and/or parking areas in connection therewith.
   (b)   The party issuing such permit may authorize the use of any newly
filled area for a period not to exceed one year before such hard surface must
be installed.
(Ord. 33-63.  Passed 11-4-63.)

that any area within or without certain lots or lands or portions thereof,
containing any area used for off-street parking or the driveways to or from
such lots or lands, is made from any substance otherwise than providing a
permanent hard or macadam surface, which surface is not in good condition and
from which gravel, sediment, leaves, debris or other material are washing into
the streets and causing excessive maintenance of the streets or the storm and
sanitary sewers of the City, or is creating a health nuisance or traffic hazard
within the immediate area of such lots or lands, by reason of dust, dirt or
other substance rising therefrom and the Director of Public Service, upon
receipt of such report, shall cause a written notice to be served upon the
owners, lessees, agents or tenants, having charge of the lots or lands and
notifying them of the nuisance that exists thereon with an order that the same
be abated within thirty days from the date of the notification or show cause
why the same should not be done by filing a petition with the Director of
Public Service.  Thereafter the Director shall within thirty days, set a time
and place for a hearing on the petition and notify the owners, lessees, agents
or tenants having charge of the premises thereof.
   (b)   Such owners or other persons having charge of such lots or lands, who
are non-residents or whose address is not known, or to whom no notice can be
readily delivered, it shall be sufficient to publish a notice of the existence
of the nuisance in a newspaper of general circulation in Franklin County, and
after completion of such notice, the Clerk of the City shall make return to the
Director of Public Service, setting forth the costs of such publication.
   (c)   Upon failure of such owners, lessees, agents or tenants who have
charge of such lots and lands, to comply with the notice within that period of
time stipulated, or who, after hearing, is ordered to abate such nuisance and
fails to do so, the Director of Public Service shall cause such nuisance to be
abated and that upon the performance of such labor the Director of Public
Service shall report to Council the cost thereof with respect to each lot or
parcel of land, including the cost of survey and notice of the proceedings and
such other necessary and legal expense as may be attributed thereto.  Upon
receipt of such report and approval thereof by Council, the City Clerk shall
make return in writing to the Auditor of Franklin County of such charges which
shall be entered upon the tax duplicate of the County.
   (d)   The Director of Public Service, in addition to the powers granted in
subsection (a), (b) and (c) hereof shall have the authority to provide for the
installation of hard, dustless surface on such area of lots and lands as may be
required to abate the nuisance declared to exist.
   (e)   The notice as provided for in subsection (a) hereof, shall be given or
made for the abating of a nuisance provided therein, and failure of such owners
and/or other persons as provided for in subsection (b) hereof to comply with
the notice shall be deemed a willful permitting of a public nuisance and
detrimental to the peace, health and safety of the general public, and the
Director of Public Service is hereby authorized to cause such lots or parcels
of land to be re-surfaced in such a manner as to abate the nuisance and that
the cost of labor and service or equipment, including the investigations,
notices, and publications shall be reported to Council in respect to each lot,
land, or parcel of land upon which the nuisance existed.  Upon receipt of such
report and approval by Council, the Clerk shall make a return in writing to the
Auditor of Franklin County of such charges which shall be entered upon the tax
duplicate of the County as it applies to each of such lots or parcels of land,
and the same shall be collected in the same manner as street assessments are
collected and returned to the City.

specifications provided by the Director of Public Service.  The application
must state the name of the owner of the property, the number of the lot the
street or highway on which such lot is located and the streets between which
the tap is to be made.  No permit shall be issued unless the owner of the

of tapping and connecting the same, with the water pipe or main shall be in
addition to the permit fee provided in Section

connection must be borne by the lot or land owner or other person making the
connection, and the lot owner shall replace the sidewalk and highway, where
opened in their former condition, and shall assume all liability for accidents
on account thereof.  He shall protect all excavations and obstructions on the
sidewalk by proper barricades and red lights.
 
   (b)   No person shall do any of the work specified in this section or to
make use of water from the water works system of the City except in strict
accordance with the provisions of this chapter and with the provisions,
requirements and specifications which may be deemed necessary and adopted by
the Director of Public Service for the protection of such water, water mains,
pipes and system, and the proper and economical use of water; and no tap or
connection or extension shall be made except in the presence of the duly
authorized agent of the City duly appointed for that purpose.
 
   (c)   All taps into such water mains or pipes made for the use of such
persons beyond the limits of the City shall be of such size as to give proper
service to the property which is to be connected therewith, and shall be
extended with extra heavy lead pipe to the point hereinbefore specified within
the curb line and provided with suitable brass fittings, corporation cock at
the main and brass service cock within the curb; which curb cock shall be
provided with a suitable iron box and these boxes shall be appropriately marked
and numbered on a part thereof so as to be visible.  The top of such boxes
shall be at or slightly above the ground level and the Director of Public
Service shall cause accurate measurements and locations of all taps,
corporation cocks and curbs to be made and recorded in a book kept for that
purpose.  All cocks shall be of a pattern so as to open with the same key and
to be turned to the left to open.  The curb cock and box shall be included in
the portion to be paid off by the owner of the premises and the cost thereof
shall be in addition to the permit fee.  No service pipe shall be laid at a
depth less than three and one-half feet below the established grade of any
street or highway or below the surface of the ground.
 
   (d)   No residence, store or other building or occupants thereof shall be

meter for the purpose of measuring the quantity of water used.  Such meter
shall be so placed as to protect the same from the action of frost and the
elements.  No opening through which water can be drawn shall be made between
the water main and the meter, such meter to be of such kind only as may be
approved by the Director of Public Service.  No part of the expense incident to
the same or the location thereof shall be borne by the City and all meters
shall be placed and located in such place and manner upon such premises as will
permit easy access thereto, and such as may be approved by the Director of
Public Service.  All meters must be tested under the direction of the Director
of Public Service or the department of Public Service of the City of Columbus,
Ohio.  If by the latter, a certificate of such test signed by the proper
officials of the City of Columbus must be filed with the Director of Public
Service.  A stop and waste shall be provided in the service pipe at the inlet
and a check valve and stop and waste at the outlet end of the meter.  Properly
authorized agents of the City shall at all times be given access to the meter
for the purpose of reading of the meter.  The Director of Public Service shall
have the right at any time to temporarily remove any meter and to test the
same, and if the same be found inaccurate they may order the same repaired or a
new meter substituted.  The necessary repairs or substitution shall be made
under the direction of the Director.  Meters shall only be removed by the
consent of the Director.
 
   (e)   The service branches are considered the property of the water
consumer, and as such the consumer will be held responsible for any leakage
that may occur between the main pipe and the meter and for the care and
maintenance of the curb box which at all times shall be free from obstruction
and of ready access for the turning on or off of water.  Failure to repair
leaks or remove obstruction from the curb box when notified to do so will be
sufficient cause for the City to shut off the water at the main until such leak
has been repaired or curb box cleared from obstruction, and the expense of
shutting off and turning on paid by the consumer.
 
   (f)   A deposit of five dollars ($5.00) shall be made with each application
for use of water from the mains of the City for the purpose of securing payment
of water rental.  The owner of the property supplied with water, in all cases
shall be held responsible for the payment of the water rent and if at any time
such owner fails to pay the amount of such water rental at the time stipulated
for the payment of the same, the Director of Public Service shall cause the
water to be shut off and the same shall not be turned on again until such
rental has been paid together with a fee of two dollars ($2.00) for the
shutting off and turning on of the water, and in the event that such rental is
not paid and is in excess of the deposit made by such consumer with the City
the Director of Public Service shall proceed to collect the same.
 
   (g)   No tap or service pipe shall be connected with more than one building
used for residence or other purpose except that buildings on the same premises
with any residence and used for the accommodation of employees of the owner
shall not be considered as separate residences.
 
   (h)   No person unless authorized by the Director of Public Service shall at
any time open or close or otherwise operate or interfere with any gate valve,
or curb cock connected with the water main.  No person shall place or deposit
any dirt or material over or adjacent to any stopcock, in such manner as to
interfere with the operation thereof. 
(Ord. 117.  Passed 11-5-13.)

misdemeanor of the first degree.  Each day on which a violation occurs or
continues shall be deemed a separate offense.

937.99   Penalty.
937.01  GENERAL.
    (a)    The City Director of Building and Zoning shall be responsible for
the enforcement of the Stormwater Management Code and shall not allow any
development of land area unless  such development meets the design requirements
specified in the City of Grandview Heights  Stormwater Design Manual adopted 
February 16, 2009 and all revisions and amendments thereto. Copies of the
Manual are on file in the office of the Clerk of Council and the  Department of
Building and Zoning and are available for downloading from the City web page. 
The Public Service Director shall serve as the principal executive officer for
stormwater  management for the purposes of fulfilling the requirements of the
Environmental Protection  Agency's NPDES Phase II Stormwater program.
   (b)    The Planning Commission shall not recommend for approval the final
plat of any  development or subdivision over which it has jurisdiction without
documentation from the Service Director, that such development or subdivision
has been designed to be in compliance with the design requirements herein.
   (c)     It is the intent of these minimum requirements to account for the
effect of stormwater  runoff from the development of land so as to minimize the
impact on existing and natural drainage systems.  While the requirements set
forth herein will not stop flooding or the damage caused by flooding, they do
establish a basis for design which will:
      (1)     Minimize the damage and inconvenience of flooding;
      (2)     Provide drainage systems which continue to benefit their
tributary area over  the long term;
      (3)     Minimize the adverse effects of new drainage systems on existing
systems; and
      (4)     Minimize the expense of maintaining the drainage facilities
within the City.
      (5)     Protect the water quality of existing water bodies to the maximum
extent     practicable.  (Ord. 09-04.  Passed 2-16-09.)
937.02  DRAINAGE POLICY.
   (a)   This drainage policy, control guidelines and criteria do not provide
solutions to all drainage problems, nor is the engineer restricted to these
designs or procedures exclusively.  Although the policies as stated will hold
true for most development work, the City realizes that there may be individual
projects involving special or unusual drainage design problems. Exceptions may
be granted by the Public Service Director to the policies and criteria in such
cases when engineering study(s) justify modification.
   (b)   Experience has shown that most of the more serious flooding situations
are "created".  Development can lead to ever increasing flooding problems
unless well-conceived, cooperative stormwater drainage and flood control
programs are undertaken throughout the entire watershed.  For this reason, the
general policy of the City of Grandview Heights shall be:
      (1)   Land uses and developments which increase runoff rate or volume
shall control the discharge rate of runoff prior to its release to off-site
land. 
      (2)   It is the responsibility of the property owner to not change or
alter any drainage course, ditch, flood routing path or drainage system on his
property that will damage or cause flooding to adjacent, upstream or downstream
property owners.
      (3)   All stormwater drainage systems, including conveyances, within a
development shall be designed to have capacity and depth, including sufficient
invert elevations to permit future connections, to serve that total tributary
area at the design storm frequency, and based on the rate of single family,
residential runoff..  The system for the upstream tributary area must be
extended through the development.
      (4)   All proposed development with a runoff rate greater than that which
the downstream system has capacity for, or will be designed for, will be
required to control the rate of stormwater discharge.
      (5)   All developments having existing controls located downstream from
the site will be required to control the flow rate of stormwater discharge to
that rate which existed prior to development.
      (6)   All information necessary shall be submitted to the City to
determine how stormwater runoff should be controlled within the development
prior to its release to downstream properties.  The tributary area and the
upstream watersheds should be determined using natural land divides unless man-
made alterations are approved by the City Engineer as the basis for watershed
delineations.
   The Stormwater Management Policy applies to all land developments not
specifically exempted or granted a waiver as provided under the appropriate
section of this Policy.
   (c)   Adequate Drainage Outlet.  Surface water runoff from a development
shall be drained off site to an adequate drainage outlet.  The location of the
outlet shall be approved by the City Engineer and may consist of a ditch,
stream, storm sewer, or approved detention basin having sufficient capacity to
accommodate the surface water runoff in an engineered manner.
(Ord. 09-04.  Passed 2-16-09.)
937.03  PROHIBITED DISCHARGES.
   (a)    No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the
Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) any materials other than
stormwater, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any
pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality
standards. Any person who allows such prohibitions to continue is considered to
be in violation of these regulations.
   (b)    Illicit Discharge Prohibition. The commencement, conduct or
continuance of any illicit discharge to the MS4 is prohibited in accordance
with the provisions this chapter and the Manual.
   (c)    Illicit Connection Prohibition.  The construction, use, maintenance
or continued existence of illicit connections to the MS4 is prohibited. This
prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in
the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or
practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection.
(Ord. 09-04.  Passed 2-16-09.)
937.04  DRAINAGE EASEMENTS.
   (a)   An adequate utility easement conveyed to the City that provides access
for City personnel shall be required along any tile, pipe, detention basin,
drainage way, flood routing path, ditch, watercourse, natural stream, man-made
stream, storm sewer or any other watercourse deemed necessary by the
Administrator which is not already within the street right-of-way.  The
easement shall be of sufficient width to allow cleaning, widening, deepening,
replacing or other general maintenance of such drainage course or piped
system.  Dimensions of required easements are defined in the City of Grandview
Heights Regulations Section
1109.04.
   (b)   When it is necessary to convey stormwater outside the property lines
of a proposed improved area in order to discharge into an adequate outlet, the
Developer:
      (1)   Shall be responsible to obtain easements and/or maintenance
agreements, in a form and substance satisfactory to the Administrator, from
abutting property owners,
      (2)   Shall remain responsible for maintenance agreements of such
drainage course unless the easements and/or maintenance agreements require the
abutting property owners to repair and maintain the drainage course
satisfactorily.
      (3)   All drainage easements, preservation areas, reserves and other
similar areas shall be shown on the "final engineering and construction plan
(s)". Drainage easements for all on-site drainage system improvements shall be
recorded for public use by final plat. For off-site drainage systems
improvements, easements should be recorded for public use by either final plat
or separate instrument.  The maintenance of such drainage easements shall be
undertaken in the manner set forth in subsection (b)(4) below.
      (4)   The Administrator, or his/her designee, is hereby authorized to
inspect such drainage easement areas and if the Administrator determines that
maintenance is needed, the Administrator shall notify the property owner  whose
property requires maintenance and/or any other parties who, in the sole
determination of the Administrator, directly benefit from such easement. The
manner in which notice of the required maintenance, and the carrying out
thereof, shall be as follows:
         A.   The Administrator shall cause written notice to be served on the
property owner and/or any other parties benefiting from the easement notifying
such parties that maintenance of the drainage course is necessary and that a
contract with a contractor acceptable to the Administrator for such repair and
maintenance must be delivered to the Administrator within fourteen (14) days of
the notice.  The notice shall be served upon the property owner and/or
benefited parties at the tax billing address for such premises reflected upon
the records of the Franklin County Auditor.  Service shall be accomplished by
any means permitted for service of summons under the Ohio Rules of Civil
Procedure.  Each property affected by such notice shall also be posted with
such notice by the Administrator.
         B.   In those instances where the address of the owner is unknown, it
shall be sufficient to publish a notice once a week in a newspaper of general
circulation in Franklin County, Ohio setting forth the substance of the notice
and time frame for compliance.  The time frame for compliance shall be no less
than fourteen (14) days after the publication.
         C.   If the property owner and/or benefiting parties fail to comply
with the notice, the City shall cause such repairs, replacement, maintenance
and abatement procedures to be implemented as determined appropriate by the
Administrator.  The cost of such repair, replacement, abatement and other
procedures deemed appropriate by the Administrator shall be immediately due and
payable to the City in the amounts and in the proportions determined by the
Administrator.  Additionally, the Administrator may assess an administrative
fee as the Administrator deems appropriate against all benefiting property
owners or benefiting parties in an amount not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of
cost of such repair, replacement, abatement and other procedures, as determined
by the City's Engineer. Such cost shall be reimbursed to the City by all
benefiting property owners or benefiting parties in an amount equally
apportioned amongst each respective property owner, for each instance where a
notice is served under this section.  The cost and administrative fee shall be
due and payable within thirty (30) days after the same are assessed.
         D.   If any fees or costs remain unpaid for a period in excess of
thirty (30) days, in addition to any other remedy available to the City, the
City may authorize placement of a lien on the real estate to be certified to
the Franklin County Auditor in the amount assessed together with interest
thereon from the date of such certification at the then existing rate for
payment of judgments in the State of Ohio.  Such interest shall continue on an
annualized basis until paid.
         E.   Any owner or benefiting party aggrieved by an action(s) of the
Administrator under this section may take an appeal to the Board of Zoning
Appeals within (30) days of the date service of notice of such action upon the
property owner and/or benefiting party.
   (c)   Waivers.
      (1)   It is conceivable that development situations may exist such that
development will have none of the harmful effects associated with increases in
runoff rates and volume.  Such developments are eligible for a waiver.  The
waiver applies only to the requirement that runoff be controlled, and does not
in any way imply a relaxation in the requirement for adequate on-site drainage
or the ability to accept runoff from land tributary to the development.
      (2)    The waiver applicant must request in writing that said
requirements for stormwater runoff control be waived.  The application shall
include sufficient technical detail to determine that granting a waiver will
not result in increased flooding and that the added volume of runoff will not
damage the receiving stream or system.
      (3)   A condition of the waiver shall be that any addition, extension, or
modification of a development for which a waiver has been granted shall be
required to provide stormwater runoff control for the entire site if preceding
limitations are exceeded by subsequent additions, extensions, or modifications.
      (4)   The following land uses and developments are eligible to apply for
a waiver on stormwater runoff control requirements contained in this Policy:
         A.   Single family residential developments:
 
Min. Lot Size      Max. Subdivision Size
1 acre             19 acres
1/2 acre           5 acres
15,000 square feet 2 acres
         B.   Multi-family residential developments which total one acre or
less.
         C.   Buildings, their related parking lots, and structures where one
acre or less is to be altered by grading, draining, removing existing ground
cover, or paving; and of which ½ acre or less will be impervious areas, such as
roofs, walks, and parking areas.
         D.   Situations where existing and adequate off-site stormwater runoff
control facilities provide the required control.  However, this shall not be
construed to imply the first development requesting use shall have full use of
available capacity.  Rather, such waiver may grant a proportional use of
available storage capacity to ensure that later developments have a similar
opportunity to utilize a portion of the storage capacity.
         E.   Development areas immediately abutting Blacklick Creek, Big
Walnut Creek and Little Walnut Creek, on which surface watershed flows directly
into these streams' channels.
      (5)   All waiver applications shall be submitted to the Administrator.
The application shall be reviewed by the City's Engineer, who shall review the
application for technical accuracy and competence.  The Administrator shall be
responsible for approving or denying the application.
         (Ord. 09-04.  Passed 2-16-09.)
937.05   OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF STORMWATER FACILITIES.
   (a)   The City shall provide for inspection and routine maintenance of storm
drainage facilities that have been accepted for maintenance by the City.  City
maintenance may include stormwater conveyance-related structure cleaning and
repair. For other storm drainage facilities not accepted for maintenance by the
City, the City may provide for remedial maintenance of facilities based upon
the severity of stormwater problems and potential hazard to public health and
safety, through the abatement procedures described in Section
937.05.  For the purposes of this Chapter, maintenance associated with
privately owned retention/detention basins including, but not limited to,
mowing, rivulet repair, basin bottom fill, seeding, fertilizing and/or algae
removal, are neither considered "potentially hazardous" to the public nor are
they considered "severe" stormwater problems, and maintenance will not be
provided by the City except in case of public emergency as determined by the
City.  (Ord. 09-04.  Passed 2-16-09.)
937.06  ABATEMENT PROCEDURES.
   (a)       Notice To Correct Improper Drainage.
      (1)   Whenever the City shall find that (i) a tract of land is
inadequately drained, or (ii)there is excessive erosion or sedimentation upon
such land or (iii) that there is an obstruction to or from a culvert, or water
course upon such land that interferes with water naturally flowing therein or
(iv) that such culvert, storm sewer or watercourse is of insufficient capacity
to reasonably accommodate the flow of water, as required by this chapter, the
City shall notify the owner or person having possession, charge, ormanagement
of such land to remove the obstruction, provide adequate drainage, fill or
drain such land, enlarge the culverts, drains or watercourses, mitgate
excessive erosion or sedimentation and/or accomplish any other act determined
by the City engineer necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. Such
notice shall be served to such persons by personal delivery, by registered mail
at the last known place of residence, or by posting on the premises.
      (2)   The owner must comply with the City's orders within the time
specified    and not to exceed 30 days. Failure to comply with such order shall
constitute an unlawful act. Each additional day thereafter during which the
owner fails to carry out the order of the City shall constitute a separate
offense.
         A.   In any case where a condition described above exists for more
than 30 days after service of notice, the Administrator may direct the owner to
fill or drain such land, remove any obstruction and, if necessary, enlarge the
culverts, drains, or watercourses to meet the requirements of this chapter.
         B.   In the event an owner fails or refuses to comply with the
Administrator's directive, the City may provide for the performance of the
required work and charge the owner the abatement costs.
         C.   Each and every owner of real property in the City consents to the
entry upon any real property in the City for all reasonable times during normal
business hours for the purpose of inspection, repair or maintenance required by
this chapter.
      (3)   Non-action by the City to observe or recognize hazardous or
unsightly conditions or to recommend denial of a permit or zoning change shall
not relieve the owner or person having possession, charge or management of such
land from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting therefrom,
and shall not result in the City, its officers or agents being responsible for
any condition or damage resulting therefrom.
      (4)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as authorizing any
person to maintain a private or public nuisance on his property, and compliance
with the provisions of this chapter shall not be a defense in any action to
abate such nuisance.
      (5)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent immediate
action by the City in emergency situations. In case of an emergency, the City
may direct that action be taken immediately to correct the condition or abate
the activity to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. The City may
perform the required work and charge the owner the abatement costs.
   (b)   Abatement Costs.
      (1)   The City shall account for all costs associated with an emergency
or abatement including, but not limited to, administration, notification,
inspection, serving of papers or documents, legal counsel, force account labor
and/or materials, enforcement, operational services, and outside contracted
services. These costs shall be billed at the discretion of the Administrator. 
This section shall not be construed to relieve the owner of any penalties
prescribed by other sections of this chapter.
      (2)   Notice of such assessment shall be given to the owner of the lot or
land charged therewith and the occupant by mailing such notice to the address
utilized by the County Treasurer for billing purposes and by posting a notice
of assessment at the subject premises.  Service may also be made in any manner
provided for service of summons by the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure.  All
assessments not paid within ten days after such mailing and posting, after
approval by Council, shall be certified by the Clerk of Council to the County
Auditor to be placed on the tax duplicate and collected as other taxes are
collected.
         (Ord. 09-04.  Passed 2-16-09.)
937.99  PENALTY.
   (a)   Any person or entity having been determined to violate this chapter or
who enters a plea to a violation thereof shall be guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.  Each day such violation continues shall constitute a separate
offense.
   (b)   The imposition of any fine or penalty pursuant to this chapter shall
not proclude the Law Administrator from instituting any appropriate legal
proceeding in a Court of proper jurisdiction to correct or abate a violation,
require compliance with this chapter or other applicable chapters, ordinances,
regulations or rules of the City or State of Ohio as determined to be
appropriate by such Law Administrator.

of Council so long as the request for such extension is presented to Council in
writing prior to the expiration of the ninety-day period after the final

and the Mayor, shall be retained in the office of the City Clerk.  One signed
copy shall be given to the subdivider. 
 
   (b)   Receipt of such signed copy is authorization for the subdivider to

   (d)   The minimum width of lots shall be in conformity with the requirements
of the Zoning Ordinance of the City.
 
   (e)   Corner lots shall have extra width to permit the maintenance of

1131.01  TITLE.
   The provisions of Titles Three and Five of this Part Eleven - Planning and
Zoning Code shall be known and may be cited and referred to as the "Zoning
Ordinance of the City of Grandview Heights, Ohio".
(Ord. 90-44.  Passed  9-4-90.)
1131.02  INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   (a)   It is the intent of this Zoning Ordinance to preserve, protect and
enhance existing development and use of land in the City and to facilitate and
encourage sound and orderly new development, in appropriate locations
compatible with existing development and beneficial to the City, in the
interest of the public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and
general welfare.  It is the further intent to divide the incorporated area of
the City into zoning districts and to regulate the use and development of land
in each district, and in all districts, according to sound principles of
community and land use planning.  It is intended that regulations be uniform
and fair to each class or type of structure or land, while allowing flexibility
for unique conditions and innovative development.
 
   (b)   Need for public service and facilities in both size and location
depends upon the character and intensity of land use.  Regulation of the use of
land is thus fundamental to a coordinated optimum physical development of the
community.  The land use regulations are intended to be the foundation of the
entire process of improvement of the physical environment.
 
   (c)   The land use regulations divide the area into a number of zoning
districts.
      (1)   In the past, residential neighborhoods have deteriorated because
they were invaded by small isolated commercial uses and by more intensive
residential uses such as duplexes or apartment buildings.  The great majority
of our population desires to, and does live in single-family homes which they
own.  The regulations establish residential districts particularly designed to
provide maximum protection for single-family homes.
      (2)   Other residential districts are established for two-family homes
and for apartments.  Density, yard and parking regulations help provide good
living conditions in these areas.  Much of the present-day building is by large
projects, instead of lot by lot.  The regulations provide for "large scale
development," two acres or more, which may be located in any residential
district with approval of the site plan and with conformity of the plan to the
overall density standards of the district.  This introduces an important
measure of flexibility into the regulations.
      (3)   Commercial districts recognize the different types of commercial
areas that will be needed by the future growth of the community.  There is a
zoning district for the neighborhood commercial area, for example, the grocery
store - drugstore complex serving the adjacent residential neighborhoods.
      (4)   For industry, there is a general district suited to the needs of
the City and to manufacturing establishments located or subject to location
therein.
      (5)   The regulations emphasize character as well as location and density
of the land uses.  Special inducements are offered for good design of apartment
areas.  Landscape planting is required in all front yards and for automobile
filling stations, parking lots and garages.  Advertising is carefully
controlled.
      (6)   The regulations are reasonable in relation to existing conditions. 
Yard dimensions are adjusted to peculiarities of existing lots.  Lots that are
now too small may be used.  Nonconforming uses are permitted to continue for
adequate time periods.
      (7)   All uses are required to provide their own off-street parking, with
a few exceptions.  Over a period of years, enforcement of this requirement will
enable streets to be used primarily for traffic movement.
      (8)   Each of the regulations has been designed to work harmoniously with
the others, with the total providing that minimum degree of land use control
essential to the realization of the optimum urban environment.

and answer such charges. Vacancies shall be filled by Council and shall be for

(Ord. 98-13. Passed 9-8-98.)
1139.02  ORGANIZATION.
   (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall organize and adopt rules and
procedures in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. Such
rules and procedures set forth by the Board of Zoning Appeals shall become
effective unless disapproved by Council within sixty days after being filed
with the Clerk of Council. Meetings of the Board shall be held at the call of
the chairman, and at such other times as the Board may determine.
   (b)   The chairman or, in his absence, the acting chairman, may administer
oaths and the Board may compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the
Board shall be open to the public. All business of the Board shall be
transacted at such meetings.
   (c)   The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of
each member upon each question or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating
such fact, and shall keep record of its examinations and other official
actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of Council and
shall be public record.
(Ord. 98-13. Passed 9-8-98.)
1139.03  APPEALS.
   Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals may be taken by any person aggrieved
who has legal standing in this matter. Such appeal shall be taken within twenty
days after the decision by filing with the officer from whom the appeal is
taken and with the Board a notice of appeal specifying the grounds therefor.
The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the Board
all the papers constituting a record upon which the action appealed from was
taken. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal,
require ten days’ notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within
a reasonable time after it is submitted. Upon the hearing, any person may
appear in person or by attorney.
(Ord. 98-13. Passed 9-8-98.)
   
1139.04  POWERS AND DUTIES.
   The powers of the Board of Zoning Appeals are:
   (a)   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in
order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Director of Building
and Zoning in the enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance in residential districts.
   (b)   To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a
district divides a lot held in a single ownership at the time of the passage of
the Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)   To permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming building that would
otherwise be prohibited by Section
1153.03, where such action would not constitute continuation of a monopoly.
   (d)   To hear and decide in specific cases such variance from the terms of
the Zoning Ordinance where there is an exceptional or unusual physical
condition of a lot which would prevent a reasonable or sensible use of the
land, buildings or structure in the residential districts. No such variance
shall be granted unless the Board does the following:
      (1)   Adopts a formal written finding that the application of the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance to the land, building or structure would
result in a “practical difficulty” that would deprive the owner of the
reasonable use of the land, building or structure, stating therein the facts
upon which such finding is based. When deciding whether a “practical
difficulty” exists the Board must consider the size of the deviation that is
sought, and weigh its probable effect on the neighborhood against the harm
which will be suffered by the applicant if the variance is refused. A
“practical difficulty” does not exist when it is self-inflicted.
      (2)   Adopts a formal written finding that the granting of the variance
will be in harmony with the general purposes and intent of the Zoning
Ordinance, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare.
   (e)   To vary the parking regulations where an applicant demonstrates
conclusively that the specific use of a building would make unnecessary the
parking spaces required by the Zoning Ordinance, but providing that such a
reduction not be more than fifty percent (50%) of the usual requirement.
   (f)   To impose conditions upon the grant of a variance so that the spirit
of the Zoning Ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice be done.
   (g)   To hear and decide upon applications for building permits where the
aesthetic values of the neighborhood would be endangered.
      (1)   The Director of Building and Zoning shall determine upon initial
review of an application for a new residence, accessory structure or home
remodeling permit, if, by the rules and procedures of the Board of Zoning
Appeals, Board approval of the application is required. If Board action is
required, the Director of Building and Zoning shall assist the applicant in
filling out an application to appear before the Board of Zoning Appeals and
shall give a copy of the rules and procedures to the applicant.
   (h)   To hear and decide upon all applications for a demolition permit to
remove a dwelling unit in the residential districts.
   (I)   To make any other determination required of it by any other provision
of the Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 98-13. Passed 9-8-98.)
1139.05  PROCEDURE FOR VARIANCE.
   (a)   Application of Variance.  Upon denial of a building permit by the
Director of Building and Zoning or to facilitate any other desired variance

1141.03(f), the applicant may file with said Director an application for a
variance.
   (b)   Written Application.  For any variance to be placed on the agenda of
the next scheduled meeting of the Board of Zoning Appeals, eight ( 8) copies of

necessary to the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights.
         F.   Such other information regarding the application for appeal as
may be pertinent or required for appropriate action by the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
      (2)   Plot plan.  The application shall be accompanied by eight copies of
a plot plan drawn to an appropriate scale showing the following:
         A.   The boundaries and dimensions of the lot.
         B.   The nature of the special conditions or circumstances giving rise
to the application for approval.

shall hold a public hearing and act on an appeal in accordance with the
provisions of Section
1139.04.

(Ord. 2008-33.  Passed 10-13-08.)
1141.04  PROCEDURE FOR AUTHORIZING A CONDITIONAL USE.
   (a)   Nature of Conditional Use. Specifically listed conditional uses are
provided within zoning district regulations in recognition that such uses,
although often desirable, will more intensely affect the surrounding area in
which they are located than the permitted uses of such zoning districts.
   The intent of this section is to set forth the development standards and
criteria to be used by the Planning Commission for locating and developing a
conditional use in accordance with the nature of the surrounding area,
conditions of development, and with regard to appropriate plans.
   (b)   Written Applications. Eight copies of a provided application form
shall be filed with the Director of Building and Zoning not less than fifteen
days prior to the date of the next Planning Commission meeting, at which the
Planning Commission will hear such application.
      (1)   Description of property and intended use. The application shall
include the following statements:
         A.   A legal description of the property.
         B.   The proposed use of the property.
         C.   A statement of the necessity or desirability of the proposed use
to the neighborhood or community.
         D.   A statement of the relationship of the proposed use to adjacent
property and land use.
         E.   Such other information regarding the property, proposed use or
surrounding area as may be pertinent to the application or required for
appropriate action by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Submittal requirements.
         A.   A survey showing boundary information, existing and proposed
development, existing and proposed easements, rights-of-way, and utilities,
including storm water drainage.
         B.   The Site Plan shall indicate buildings, service areas, parking,
signage, fencing, landscaping, and all required setbacks.
         C.   All parking and loading areas shall be shown, including typical
dimensions of parking stalls, aisles, and loading spaces.
         D.   All major circulation routes, including arterials, adjacent curb
cuts, collector and local streets, driveway and curb cuts, and including major
aisle ways and service routes shall be indicated. Major pedestrian circulation
routes shall also be indicated, including dimensions of path and pedestrian
crossings, etc., plus any attempts at separating vehicular and pedestrian/
recreation movement.
         E.   The method for handling of all waste and refuse materials shall
be indicated.
         F.   Proposed landscaping shall be shown.
         G.   All signage and graphics may be required to be shown, in
accordance with Chapter
1167, Signs.
         H.   All exterior lighting shall be shown, including parking lot,
pedestrian, and building accent lighting. Lighting intensity and installation
height shall be indicated.
         I.   Exterior building design and surface treatments shall be
indicated, including building material and color. Color and material samples
may also be requested.
   (c)   Actions of the Planning Commission.  The Planning Commission shall
hold a public hearing and act on a conditional use in one of the following
ways:
      (1)   Approval. The Planning Commission shall approve an application for
conditional use if the following three conditions are met:
         A.   The proposed use is a conditional use of the zoning district, and
the applicable development standards established in the Zoning Ordinance are
met.
         B.   The proposed development is in accordance with appropriate plans
for the area.
         C.   The proposed development will be in keeping with the existing
land use character and physical development potential of the area.
      (2)   Approval with modification. The Planning Commission may approve
with modification an application for a conditional use, if the proposed use is
a conditional use of the zoning district and the applicable development
standards are met, but plot plan modification is required to be in accordance
with appropriate plans for the area and to prevent undesirable effects on
adjacent property and the surrounding area. Such modification may be a
limitation on the extent or intensity of development, a requirement for
additional screening by fence or landscaping, a change in the method or plan
for lighting, control of access or other conditions of development as may be
required. Recommendations regarding the modification of plans or other
appropriate actions shall be stated with the reasons for each recommendation.
      (3)   Disapproval. The Planning Commission shall only disapprove an
application for a conditional use for any one of the following reasons:
         A.   The proposed use is not a conditional use of the zoning district,
or the applicable development standards are not and cannot be met.
         B.   The proposed development is not in accord with appropriate plans
of the area.
         C.   The proposed development will have undesirable effects on the
surrounding area and is not in keeping with the existing land use character and
physical development potential of the area.
      (4)   Conditional use approval. Upon a favorable finding, the Planning
Commission shall approve a conditional use application within thirty days
following the public hearing.
   (d)   Issuance of a conditional use permit.  A conditional use permit shall
become effective upon approval of the Planning Commission.  Such conditional
use permit shall authorize only one particular use and such permit shall
automatically expire if, for any reason, the conditional use shall not begin
within two years after the permit is issued or if such use shall cease for more
than six months after the permit is issued.  A conditional use permit shall be
personal to the applicant and shall not run with the land, and shall expire
upon a transfer of ownership or change of tenants.
   (e)   Building permit. A building permit may be obtained only for the
development in accordance with the approved plot plan.
(Ord. 98-13. Passed 9-8-98.)
1141.05  FEES.
   A fee shall be charged when an application is filed for a conditional use or
site plan review as follows:
 
(a)   Single-family               $  25.00
(b)   Two-family to less than 25 dwelling units   $  50.00

1145.01  INTERPRETATION.
   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the
promotion of the public health, safety and welfare, and shall be interpreted so
as to effectuate the intent and purpose of the Zoning Ordinance as set forth in
Chapter 1131.  To protect the public, among other purposes, such provisions are
intended to provide for adequate light, air, safety from fire and other danger,
undue concentration of population and ample parking facilities.
(Ord. 90-44.  Passed  9-4-90; Ord. 98-13. Passed 9-8-98.)
1145.02  CONFLICT.
   It is not intended by the Zoning Ordinance to repeal, abrogate, annul or in
any way impair or interfere with existing provisions of other laws or
ordinances, except those specifically repealed by the Zoning Ordinance, nor
private restrictions placed upon property by covenant, deed or other private
agreement, nor restrictive covenants running with the land to which the City is
a party.  Where the Zoning Ordinance imposes a greater restriction upon land,
buildings or structures than is imposed or required by such existing provisions

1151.07  GRANDVIEW AVENUE OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (a)   Purpose.  These overlay standards have been created to utilize the
site plan review process of the Planning Commission to promote the Grandview
Avenue District, as defined in the Community Plan, as a compact, pedestrian-
oriented district with a diverse mix of residential office and commercial uses,
creating a place that represents a unique, attractive, and memorable
destination for visitors and residents.
   (b)   Intent.
      (1)   To allow a vertical mix of uses between ground level retail and
office and residential units or office uses above;
      (2)   To add streetscape elements and other outdoor pedestrian spaces
that encourage activity, sociability, safety, and visual appeal;
      (3)   To enhance the public realm space on both sides of Grandview Avenue
so as to create a pedestrian loop; 
      (4)   To encourage shared parking among commercial uses; and
      (5)   To minimize curb cuts and other vehicle intrusions on the
pedestrian, street-level experience.   
   (c)   Grandview Avenue Overlay District Described.
      (1)   The boundaries of the Grandview Avenue Overlay District will
include all properties with frontage on Grandview Avenue between Third Avenue
and First Avenue which lie within the corporation limits of Grandview Heights. 
It will also include three (3) properties with current addresses of 1510, 1516/
1520 and 1530 West First Avenue.
      (2)   The boundaries of the Grandview Avenue Overlay District shall be
indicated in the official Zoning District Map of the City with the symbol
“GAOD” (Grandview Avenue Overlay District).  The Grandview Avenue Overlay
District shall be in addition to and shall overlay all other zoning districts
where the district is established. Therefore, any parcel of land lying in the
GAOD district shall also lie in one or more of the other zoning districts
provided for in this Zoning Ordinance. The district designation of GAOD shall
be superimposed over the existing zoning designations on the Zoning District
Map.
   (d)   Applicability and Extent.
      (1)   The standards and requirements of this Section may be waived for
buildings  recognized by the Grandview Heights/Marble Cliff Historical Society
as historic if applying them would result in an unacceptable modification of
the original, historic appearance of the building.
      (2)   Except as modified by this overlay district, the provisions of the
applicable base-zoning district shall apply to all development within the   
boundary of the designated area.  Where provisions of this overlay Ordinance
impose greater restrictions than other existing laws, regulations or
ordinances, the provisions of this overlay Ordinance shall govern.To the extent
that this overlay Ordinance does not expressly address a restriction,  the 
Zoning Ordinances of the City will apply.
      (3)   No building shall be erected, converted, expanded, reconstructed
or        structurally altered except in accordance with the development
standards and design guidelines of this overlay district.  For building
expansion of up to 50%, only the new addition requires compliance with these
standards and guidelines.
      (4)   The extension or expansion of a building toward Grandview Avenue is
subject to all standards and requirements of this overlay district.
      (5)   Routine maintenance and in-kind replacement of materials are exempt
from the standards and requirements of this overlay district.
      (6)   All modifications to the public realm space are subject to the
development standards and design guidelines of this overlay district.
   (e)   Procedures.
      (1)   The provisions of Section
1157.06 governing Site Plan Review will apply.
      (2)   The development standards and design guidelines of the Grandview
Avenue Overlay District will serve as (1) guidelines for consideration by
applicants in preparing site plans, and (2) constitute the criteria to be
considered by the Director of Building and Zoning and the Planning Commission
in reviewing site plans.
      (3)   Requests for variance and site plan review may be submitted
concurrently, though they need not be.  If not submitted and reviewed
concurrently, variances must be approved before site plan review.

front setback for buildings and other structures as measured from the curb-line
of a street.
      (6)   Commercial:  As used in this overlay ordinance, “commercial” refers
to land uses permitted in the underlying zoning district. 
      (7)   Cross Easement:  Contractual permission granted by property owner
(s) to third parties to use, walk or drive between adjacent properties under
different ownership.
      (8)   Principal Building:  “Principal building: means a building in which

   (g)   Setbacks and Build-to Lines.
      (1)   Front: The front setback and build-to lines shall be determined by
the  standards and guidelines regulating the public realm space.
      (2)   Side:  The minimum side yard setback is five (5) feet. The Planning
Commission may reduce the side yard setback to zero (0) if it determines that a
reduced setback is consistent with current development plans on the adjacent
property.  Sides of buildings along secondary streets will subject to the
public realm requirements of Section
1151.07(h).
      (3)   Minimum setbacks:  The minimum rear or side yard setback off a
public  alley shall be nineteen (19) feet from the right-of-way to the  ground
floor.
   (h)   Building Standards.

design of all improvements, additions, modernization or renovations of
buildings within the Grandview Avenue District shall be in reasonable
conformance with, or be representative of, the design guidelines, as set forth
herein.
      (2)   A variety of architecture expressions is encouraged as a means of
enhancing diverse mixed use, character of the community.  Each development
project will, by use of massing, articulation, materials and detail, contribute
to a coherent form and eclectic character within the Grandview Avenue District.
         A.   Primary Façade:  Any building with frontage on  Grandview Avenue
shall have its front or primary façade on this frontage.
         B.   Primary Entry: The building shall provide a primary pedestrian
entrance to Grandview Avenue.
         C.   Ground Floor Building Depth: The minimum depth of ground- floor
retail or office space from the building front is forty (40) feet.
         D.   Minimum Building Height:  Buildings are to contain two  (2)
floors or achieve thirty (30) feet in height.
         E.   Ground Floor Minimum-Ceiling Height:  Minimum ceiling height of
ten (10) feet.
         F.   Ground Floor Transparency:  A minimum of sixty percent (60%) and
maximum of eight-five percent (85%) of the front façade between two (2) feet
and ten (10) feet above sidewalk grade must be comprised of clear windows that
allow views to a depth of ten (10) feet of indoor commercial space or product
display areas.
            1.   The bottom edge of any window or product display window used
to satisfy the transparency standard may not be more than three (3) feet above
the adjacent sidewalk.
            2.   Product display windows used to satisfy these requirements
must have a minimum height of  four (4)  feet and be internally lighted.
         G.   Reduced Building Volumes: A continuous primary façade that
exceeds a width of forty (40) feet shall be broken down in scale by means of
the articulation of separate volumes.  These shall be well proportioned and
related to create satisfactory composition.  Building volumes should be further
articulated to break down the perceived scale and mass of the structure at
locations along    secondary building frontages.
         H.   Upper Floor Windows:  Upper floor windows must be clear and
comprise a minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of the front façade higher than
fourteen (14) feet above finish grade.  This ratio must be less than that met
on the ground floor.
         I.   Corner Buildings:  Building footprints may be required to be
chamfered at corners to provide visibility at street intersections.
         J.   Façade Interruptions: Courtyards, walkways, or other
interruptions in the primary façade building wall for  pedestrian traffic shall
be permitted, provided that the interruption to the primary façade street wall
is minimal.
         K.   Four-sided Architecture: All façades shall have the same level of
design attention and comparable use of materials as the front façade.
         L.   Building Massing: Building massing should provide additional
variation and architectural interest that promotes cohesive community scale and
any attractive pedestrian environment.
         M.   Roof Lines: A varied building silhouette is encouraged through
changes in the massing at rooflines.
         N.   Design Interest: Within a clear and coherent architectural
composition, building facades should be articulated by means of recess, changes
in plane, bays, projecting elements, variations in exterior facades or
combination thereof.
         O.   Rooftop Treatment: As many roofs will be visible from surrounding
structures, they should be designed to be visually interesting, using non-
reflective materials and colors that do not contribute to the urban heat island
effect.
         P.   Building Penetrations:  Appliance vents, exhaust fans, and
similar roof penetrations should be located so as to not be visible from
streets or open spaces.  Exposed metal penetrations and roof accessories should
be finished to match or blend with the roof color.
         Q.   Building Materials: Exterior building materials should be durable
and of high quality.  Selection should rely upon traditional and natural
materials such as brick, stone and glass.  Exterior Insulation and finish
Systems (EIFS), vinyl or aluminum siding, and split or scored faced  concrete
block are not acceptable materials.
         R.   Rofing Materials: Materials visible from the street should be
concrete or clay tile, high quality composition shingles, slate, or standing
seam metal roofing.  Sheet or roll roofing are not permitted.
         S.   Exterior Color: Each project should create a cohesive color
palette that takes into consideration the finish of all exterior elements, and
that compliments the architectural character and composition of the building. 
Projects are encouraged to employ  more than one body color to articulate the
form, rhythm and scale of the building.  Accent colors are encouraged where
they enhance the architectural character of the development project.
         T.   Mechanical Penetrations at Facades: The placement of mechanical
penetrations, especially exhaust vents, should consider the visual and air
quality impact on nearby residential areas.  Cooking odors should be eliminated
to the extent feasible  by installation of the best available ventilation
technology.  Project applications shall include information on proposed
ventilation systems and odor scrubbing technology to be used.
   (i)   Public Realm Space.
      (1)   The public realm space will consist of public right of way as well
as the privately owned space that will exist between the curb line and the
building. The development standards for this area are as follows:
         A.   A build-to line of 16’ to 18’ as measured from the curb line of 
Grandview Avenue to the primary structure shall be established extending the
full length of Grandview Avenue.
         B.   At least  fifty (50) percent or more of the primary structure
must align with the build-to line at the ground level.  The primary structure 
may be setback further to increase the size of the public realm space.  Up to
fifty (50)  percent of the ground floor frontage of a building may be setback
to a maximum distance of twelve (12) feet.
         C.   Allowable encroachment on the public realm space provided
pedestrian circulation is maintained:
            1.   Café tables and seating. No fence or other enclosure may
surround the encroaching seating area without the permission of the Planning
Commission.
            2.   Product display racks.  Racks are to be located in front of
the establishment responsible for the maintenance and sale of those goods.
Racks must be removed after hours of operation.
            3.   On-premises signage. Signage may still be considered “on-
premises” if it is located in the public realm space in front of the
establishment it advertises. Signage standards still apply.
            4.   The Planning Commission may permit other encroachment on the
public realm space in accordance with the purpose and intent of the district.
         D.   Frontage forms allowed:
            1.   Shop front:  a frontage wherein the façade is aligned with the
edge of the sidewalk at the build-to line  with the building entrance at
sidewalk grade.  An awning may overlap the public realm up to four (4) feet for
a sixteen (16) foot setback or six (6) feet for an eighteen (18) foot set 
mark.
            2.   Planning and design of improvements to the public real space
must take into consideration and be in reasonable conformance with current
Grandview Avenue street and streetscape improvement plans.
   (j)   Signage.
      (1)   Signs within the Grandview Avenue District should be creative and
be  designed to contribute to the character, vitality and visual appeal of the
public realm.  Signs should also be complimentary with the architecture of the
buildings.
         A.   The provisions of Chapter
1167 Signs will serve as a general reference for planning and designing of new
signs.
         B.   Permanent signage allowed: wall signs, marquee signs, awning
signs, window signs, and canopy signs when displaying no advertising matter
except pertaining to the business conducted in the building on which such sign
is placed.  All signs including walls signs must be approved the Planning
Commission as part of an overall sign plan. 
         C.   Existing ground signs will continue to be regulated under the
provisions of Chapter
1167.
   (k)   Parking and Circulation.
      (1)   Additional curb cuts on Grandview Avenue to lots with real alley
and side street access shall not be permitted.  On lots without such access,
vehicular driveways shall be permitted on or adjacent to lot lines with
appropriate driveway/access easements as determined by the Planning Commission,
anticipating shared access to limit future curb cuts.
      (2)   Drive-through facilities for vehicles are prohibited.
      (3)   No parking or maneuvering shall be permitted between the primary
building and any public street.  The minimum parking setback from an alley
shall be zero (0) feet. Parking areas adjacent to residentially zoned property
must be setback sufficiently to permit the installation of opaque walls, fences
or landscaping.
      (4)   Off-street parking and loading spaces are to be provided as
specified in §
1153.06 ; §
1155.13 , §
1157.07 (b) (8), §
1157.07 (b) (9), and §
1157.07 (b) (10).
      (5)   When applicable, rear parking areas must be connected with cross
easements to permit interval circulation across lot lines.
      (6)   Mechanical lifts and stacked parking shall be allowed to meet the
residential use requirement provided that no parking space is blocked by more
than one (1) other parking space.  Stacked parking associated with a commercial
use requires an attendant or valet to be present during hours of operation.
      (7)   Parking lots along the street must be screened from the adjacent
street and sidewalk by walls, fences, or landscaping.
   (l)   Screening.
      (1)   All establishments shall be required to enclose all outdoor refuse
containers on all sides.  This enclosure shall be constructed to maintain a
minimum three (3) foot clearance between itself and the dumpster, and shall be
at least one (1) foot higher than the highest part of the refuse container or
containers enclosed.  Such enclosures shall be constructed of opaque materials
similar to that of which the principal building is constructed.
      (2)   Service doors and gates should be designed as an integral element
of the building design and screened from predominant public view.
      (3)   All open service areas, outdoor storage areas, or loading docks
shall be screened by walls or fences, six (6) feet minimum height, eight (8)
feet maximum height, that effectively conceal such operations from adjacent
streets or adjacent residential districts.
      (4)   Equipment Screening:  Mechanical equipment should be screened from
predominate public view by one of the following means:
         A.   By enclosure entirely within the structure of the building with
access provided by opaque service access doors, a portion of which may be
exposed for meter reading.
         B.   By enclosure in a below grade vault or structure. 
         C.   By  provision of a fence or wall with a minimum opacity of fifty
percent (50%)  the top of the fence or wall should be at least equal in height
to the equipment screened but not higher than eight (8) feet.
         D.   By combination of an open fence and adjoining planting that  will
reach a height sufficient to screen the equipment within  three years.
         E.   Residential gas meters serving individual dwelling units in
groups not exceeding four meters, individual commercial gas meters, and back
flow preventers for irrigation systems not exceeding 2” nominal size, are
excluded from the screening requirement.
   (m)   Lighting.
      (1)   Exterior lighting must be designed, located, constructed, and
maintained to minimize light trespass and spill over off the subject property. 
To achieve this objective, the following are mandatory site lighting
requirements:
         A.   Area lighting fixtures must direct light downwardly, i.e. must be
cut-off type fixtures.
         B.   The height of any freestanding parking lot light pole/fixture
must be in the range of 12 to 18 feet above grade depending on location and
function (pedestrian or parking lot lighting).
         C.   Exterior building light fixtures must not generate excessive
light levels, cause glare, or direct light beyond the façade onto neighboring
property, streets, or the night sky.  Strobe or flashing lights are not
permitted.
         D.   Security lighting must be from full cut-off type fixtures,
shielded and aimed so that the light is directed to the area that is being
protected by light.
         E.   The average horizontal illumination levels on the ground should
not exceed one-half (1/2) foot candle.

1153.03  NONCONFORMING USES.
   (a)   Nonconforming Use of Land. Where open land is being used as a
nonconforming use, and such use is the principal use and not accessory to the
main use conducted in a building, such use shall be discontinued not later than
two years from the date of passage of this section. During the two-year period,
such nonconforming use shall not be extended or enlarged either on the same or
adjoining property. Any building incident and subordinate to such use of land,
such as a shed, tool house, storage building, office or trailer, shall be
removed at the end of the two-year period or, if such building is constructed
so as to permit the issuance of a permit for a use not excluded from the
district, such building may remain as a conforming use; thereafter, both land
and building shall be used only as conforming uses.
   (b)   Nonconforming Use of Buildings. Except as otherwise provided herein,
the lawful use of a building existing at the effective date of this section may
be continued although such use does not conform to the provisions hereof. If no
significant structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a building
may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or of a more restricted
classification. Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a more
restricted use or to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed
to a less restricted use. The nonconforming use of a building may be hereafter
extended throughout those parts of a building which were lawfully and
manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of the enactment of
this section.
   (c)   Discontinuance of Nonconforming Uses. No land, building, or portion
thereof used in whole or in part for a nonconforming use in a residential or
commercial district, which remains idle or unused for a continuous period of
180 days, whether or not the equipment or fixtures are removed, shall again be
used except in conformity with the regulations of the residential or commercial
district in which it is located.
   (d)   Nonconforming Advertising Signs. All advertising signs in violation of
the provisions of this section shall be brought into conformity with all
requirements of this section.
   (e)   Conditional Uses Not Conforming. Existing uses eligible for
conditional use permits shall not be nonconforming uses but shall require a
conditional use permit for any alteration, enlargement, or extension.
   (f)   Intermittent Use. The casual, intermittent, temporary or illegal use
of land or buildings shall not be sufficient to establish the existence of a
nonconforming use and the existence of a nonconforming use on a part of a lot
or tract shall not be construed to establish a nonconforming use on the entire
lot or tract.
   (g)   Existence of a Nonconforming Use. Whether a nonconforming use exists
shall be a question of fact and shall be decided by the Board of Zoning Appeals
after public notice and hearing and in accordance with the rules of such Board.
   (h)   Nonconforming Uses Not Validated. An illegal nonconforming use under
the terms of the ordinance which this Zoning Ordinance repeals shall not
automatically become a legal nonconforming use by the adoption of this Zoning
Ordinance.

1153.04  SATELLITE EARTH STATIONS.
   Satellite Earth Stations shall be no more than one meter in diameter when

1153.05 RESERVED.
   EDITOR’S NOTE: This section is reserved for future legislation.
1153.06  DISCONTINUED USES; ABANDONED LOTS AND BUILDINGS.
   (a)   Any principal use or building, where the use is discontinued for any
period of time, shall be securely locked to prevent the entrance of
unauthorized persons and shall be maintained as may be necessary to prevent the
building or structure from deteriorating into a state of disrepair; the grounds
shall be manicured and kept free of weeds and rubbish.  If the use is to be
discontinued for a period of ninety days or more, any outdoor facilities or
special equipment shall be removed, enclosed or otherwise cared for in a manner
protecting the public interest.  Use of a lot for parking or similar purposes,
without a special permit from the Board of Zoning Appeals, shall be deemed a
new principal use and shall be subject to all regulations of this Zoning
Ordinance.
   (b)   Determination and Effect of Abandonment.
      (1)   It is hereby found and declared that every building which may be
abandoned, in the manner provided herein, is likely to constitute a public
nuisance, by reason of the deterioration of the structures and grounds
resulting from a lack of maintenance and supervision, and which conditions
cause a blighting influence on nearby properties and depreciate the
neighborhood to such an extent as to be harmful to the public health, safety,
welfare and morals.  An abandoned building or lot is defined as one which has
been unoccupied for any six months in any twelve month period and for which
maintenance and supervision has not been performed.
      (2)   Whenever the Mayor or his authorized representative finds, upon
investigation, a building or lot which appears to have been abandoned, he shall
hold a hearing on the question of abandonment.  A notice of the date of such
hearing shall be sent to the owner of the property in question at least fifteen
days before the hearing date.
      (3)   The Mayor shall cause photographs for such building and grounds to
be made and to be kept on file in the office of the Director of Building and
Zoning, together with a written report of the findings of the aforesaid
hearing. 
      (4)   Within seven days after such hearing, the Mayor shall cause a
written notice to be served on the owner stating his determination as to
whether the building or lot has been abandoned.  Said notice shall state that
unless the owner shall cause the building and other improvements and the
grounds on which the same are located to be properly maintained, the City will
cause such work to be done.
      (5)   In the event of the failure of the owner to immediately provide
such maintenance or other work required by these Codified Ordinances, the Mayor
shall cause such work to be done and shall bill the cost thereof to the owner,
and if the same is not paid within a reasonable period of time, the Mayor shall
cause such cost to be levied as an assessment or he may commence a civil action
for the recovery thereof.
      (6)   The notices above provided for shall be served either personally or
by leaving a copy at the usual place of resident or by mailing a copy by United
States Certified Mail with return receipt requested to such owner at this usual
place of residence.  If the service of said written notice is not perfected by
any of the said methods, the Mayor shall cause such notice to be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the City of Grandview Heights once each
week for two consecutive weeks, and shall further cause a copy of the notice to
be posted on the premises.
      (7)   The owner may, within ten days after completion of the service of
said notice of the findings of the hearing, appeal to the City Council the
determination that the building has been abandoned.  Council shall give the
Appellant at least five days written notice of the date fixed for such hearing,
and shall give Appellant written notice of its decision on such appeal.  (Ord.
98-13. Passed 9-8-98; Ord. 2012-01.  Passed 1-17-12.)
1153.07  RULES FOR COMPUTING PARKING SPACES.
   In computing the number of required off-street parking spaces, the following
rules shall apply:
   (a)   Floor area shall mean the gross floor area of the specific use,
excluding any floor or portion thereof used for parking, as herein defined.
   (b)   Where fractional spaces result, the parking spaces required shall be
the nearest whole number.
   (c)   In the case of mixed uses, the parking spaces required shall equal the
sum of the requirements of the various uses computed separately.
   (d)   Whenever a building or use constructed or established after the
effective date of this section, is changed or enlarged in floor area, number of
employees, number of dwelling units, seating capacity or otherwise, parking
spaces shall be provided on the basis of the enlargement or change. Whenever a
building or use existing prior to the effective date of this section is
reconstructed, changed, or enlarged to the extent of twenty percent (20%) or
more in floor area, such building or use in its entirety shall then thereafter
comply with the parking requirements set forth herein. Any enlargement or
change in use of less than twenty percent (20%) of the gross floor area shall
be provided with parking based on the enlargement or change.
(Ord. 98-13. Passed 9-8-98; Ord. 2012-01.  Passed 1-17-12.)
1153.08  MINIMUM PARKING LOT IMPROVEMENT & MAINTENANCE STANDARDS.
   Parking lots and storage garages shall conform with the following
improvement and maintenance standards:
   (a)   Such lot shall be surfaced either with concrete not less than six
inches in thickness or with bituminous surface of not less than two inches in
depth on top of a compacted, crushed stone base not less than six inches in
depth, or with any surfacing adjudged by the City Engineer to be equal or
superior to either or these types.
   (b)   Provision shall be made for the disposal of storm water so that such
water shall not flow onto adjoining property or adjacent sidewalks in a
quantity or manner that would be detrimental thereto, or inconvenient to
persons using the sidewalk.
   (c)   A structurally sound wall or other protective device approved by the
City Engineer to ensure safety shall be installed around each side of the
parking lot wherever such lot adjoins a public street, sidewalk, or alley. An
adequate retaining wall shall be installed wherever necessary to prevent the
washing of soil to and from adjoining property and a wall.
   (d)   The location and width of entrances and exits to and from the lot or
garage shall be as determined by the City Engineer, but there shall not be more
than one entrance and one exit, or one combined entrance or exit, along any one
street unless same is deemed necessary for the alleviation of traffic
congestion and interference of traffic movement along such street.
   (e)   The location of each parking space and the location and direction of
movement along the driveways providing access thereto shall be indicated by
painting upon the surface, by raised directional signs, or by markers or other
similar measures placed in the surfacing, where required by the City Engineer.
   (f)   Whenever a parking area extends to a lot line, street curb, sidewalk,
planter strip, or building, a wheel stop device consisting of blocks, a
permanent curb, expanded sidewalk, or other suitable restraint shall be
installed to prevent any part of a parked motor vehicle from extending beyond
the property line, overhanging a pedestrian walkway or sidewalk, or damaging
any building, structure or landscaping.
   (g)   A sign, the size and character of which shall be approved by the
Director of Building and Zoning, shall be installed showing the ownership of
the lot or garage and the permitted use thereof. If the lot or garage is so
operated that a charge is made for the use of the parking facilities, the rates
for parking shall be legibly shown upon the sign.
   (h)   Any person operating a parking lot or garage shall either:
(1)   File with the City a bond in such form as may be prescribed by the City
Attorney and in such amount as required by the Director of Building and Zoning
which shall be surety for any judgment for damages rendered against the
operator of the parking lot, resulting to person or property, when incurred
while using the parking lot; or,
(2)   Carry public liability insurance in such amount as may be required by the
Director of Building and Zoning.
   (i)   Parking spaces shall be constructed of either impervious material such
as macadam, asphalt, asphaltic concrete or paving brick, or pervious material
such as marble chips or loose gravel, to a minimum depth of four inches. 
However, any repair or partial replacement of parking spaces constructed of
impervious materials must be completed with the same or similar impervious
material.
   (j)   Parking spaces shall be maintained free of weeds and other debris.
   (k)   When a parking space is constructed of pervious material such as loose
gravel or marble chips, a border made of material sufficient to clearly define
the parking space from the adjacent lawn area or an adjacent property shall
exist at all times. Such border shall also prevent the spread of parking space
materials to adjacent lawn areas or property and vice versa. The border
material shall be subject to the approval of the Director of Building and
Zoning.
   (l)   No person shall park or stand a vehicle, except a bicycle, in a front,
side, or rear yard unless a parking space or driveway is constructed and
maintained in accordance with this section.
   (m)   Adjacent street and alley surfaces shall be kept free of parking space
construction materials.
   (n)   Any parking lot or parking space not in conformity with the
regulations of this section is hereby declared to be a nuisance and therefore
immediately becomes unlawful, even if such use existed prior to this section.

1155.07  AESTHETIC REVIEW PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of this review by the Director of Building and
Zoning pursuant to Section
1137.06 or by the Board of Zoning Appeals hereunder is to assure that all
structures  are constructed or altered so as to maintain the high character of
the community development and to protect real estate within this City from
impairment or destruction of value, by regulating according to proper
architectural principles the design, use of materials, finished grade, lines
and orientation of all new buildings hereafter erected; the moving, alteration,
improvement, repair, adding to or razing in whole or in part of all existing
buildings; and the Board shall exercise its powers and perform its duties for
the accomplishment of such purposes only.
   This section is intended to prevent the impairment of stability and value of
both improved and unimproved property and the degeneration of conditions
affecting the health, safety, comfort, and general welfare of the inhabitants. 
(Ord. 98-13.  Passed 9-8-98.)
   (b)   The Board has the authority to hear and decide applications for
building permits in residential neighborhoods where the Director of Building
and Zoning has determined that the aesthetic values of the neighborhood would
be endangered. In hearing and deciding such applications, the Board shall use
as guiding principles the Grandview Heights Design Guidelines posted on June
24, 2009 on the City of Grandview Heights’ website or available upon request
from the City’s Building Department.  The Board may approve, approve
conditionally subject to specified modifications or disapprove any application
for a building permit referred to it by the Director of Building and Zoning as
set forth in Section
1139.04  hereof, provided that such disapproval shall be by the majority vote
of all of the members of the Board present at any meeting where such vote is
taken, and provided that the Board finds that the building for which the permit
was applied would if erected be so detrimental to the desirability, property
values or development of the surrounding area as to provoke one or more of the
harmful effects set forth in subsection (a) hereof, by reason of:
      (1)   Excessive similarity to any other structure existing or for which a
permit has been issued or to any other structure included in the same permit
application, facing upon the same street and within 250 feet of the proposed
site, in respect to one or more of the following features of exterior design
and appearance:
         A.   Apparently identical facade.
         B.   Substantially identical size and arrangement of either doors,
windows, porticos, or other openings or breaks in the facade facing the street,
including reverse arrangement.
         C.   Other significant identical features of design, provided that a
finding of excessive similarity shall state not only that excessive similarity
exists, but further that it is of such a nature as to be expected to provoke
one or more of the harmful effects set forth in subsection (a) hereof.
      (2)   Excessive dissimilarity in relation to any other structure existing
or for which a permit has been issued, or to any other structure included in
the same permit application, facing upon the same street or intersecting street
and within 250 feet of the proposed site in respect to one or more of the
following features:
         A.   Cubical contents.
         B.   Gross floor area.
         C.   Height of building or height of roof.
         D.   Other significant design features such as materials or quality of
architectural design.
      (3)   Inappropriateness in relation to the established character of other
structures in the immediate area or neighboring areas in respect to significant
design features such as materials or quality of architectural design, provided
that a finding of inappropriateness shall state not only that such
inappropriateness exists, but that it is of such a nature as to be reasonably
expected to provoke one or more of the harmful effects set forth in subsection
(a) hereof, and that the finding is not based on personal preference as to
taste or choice of architectural style.

1157.035 PCD PLANNED COMMUNITY DISTRICT.
   (a)    Purpose and Intent.
      (1)   Purpose. The Planned Community District (PCD) shall allow for a
mixture of land uses within such district in order to:
         A.   Respect the unique characteristics of the site and surrounding
uses;
         B.   Encourage imaginative arrangements of land use types that
complement one another and the character of the surrounding community;
         C.   Provide amenities that encourage pedestrian activity;
         D.   Allow a development pattern which preserves and utilizes the
natural topography, geologic features, vegetation and drainage; and
         E.   Recognize the need to mitigate the impacts of incompatible land
uses.
      (2)   Intent. The intent of this section is to allow the applicant to
lessen the development standards in some areas in exchange for an increase in
development standards in another or others.
      (3)   Process.  The process for achieving the stated purposes and intent
is to require the submission and approval of a Development Plan for the total
proposed development prior to obtaining a Zoning Certificate as part of the
approval for the construction of any portion of the area. A Concept Plan may be
submitted for approval prior to the submission of the Development Plan. As part
of the Concept or Development Plan, whichever is submitted first, the applicant
must prepare and submit a Development Standards Text that identifies any
development standard that is less restrictive than the standards set forth in
this section or other sections of the Zoning Code.  As part of the Development
Standards Text, the applicant must justify the proposed modifications of these
standards by clearly demonstrating that the proposed development goes beyond
the minimum requirements in other areas and will result in a development
superior to that which would have resulted from following the standards set
forth in the remainder of the Zoning Code. The application shall first be
submitted to the Planning Commission (“Commission”) and upon its approval of
the Final Development Plan, forwarded to City Council (“Council”) for its
consideration.

district but require more detailed evaluation with respect to location, design,
size, method and hours of operation, intensity of use and traffic generation
and potential impact on surrounding uses, in order to provide an opportunity
for these uses while safeguarding both individual property rights and general,
community welfare. It is the Planning Commission’s responsibility to perform
this evaluation and, after review, to attach necessary conditions and
safeguards. The development standards contained in this chapter are minimum
standards. Planning Commission may require more restrictive standards for a
conditional use based on the merits of each application. Review and approval of
these uses are further regulated in Section
1141.04, Conditional Uses.
      (2)   The following uses are conditionally permitted within the Light
Industrial District. These uses generally display one or more of three
characteristics which result in its conditional status: (1) inherently cannot

1157.045 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) DISTRICT.
   (a)    Purpose and Intent.  The application of flexible and creative land
use regulations to the development or redevelopment of land is often difficult
or impossible within the constraints of traditional zoning district standards.
In order to permit the implementation of more flexible land use regulations and
to facilitate the use of the most advantageous techniques of land development,
it is often necessary to establish a Planned Unit Development District
designation in which development is in harmony with the general purpose and
intent of this Zoning Ordinance and the Community Plan. The objective of a
Planned Unit Development District is to encourage ingenuity, imagination, and
creative design efforts on the part of builders, architects, site planners and
developers, and to produce development that is in keeping with overall land use
intensity and design standards of this Zoning Ordinance and the Community Plan
while departing from the strict application of the dimensional standards of the
traditional zoning Districts. Planned Unit Development Districts are intended
to allow design flexibility and provide performance standards that may:
      (1)    Ensure that development and redevelopment occurs in general
accordance with the Community Plan;
      (2)    Result in a desirable environment with more amenities than would
be possible through the strict application of the standards of other zoning
districts;
      (3)    Provide for an efficient use of land and public resources,
resulting in co- location of harmonious uses to share facilities and services
and a logical network of utilities and streets, thereby lowering public and
private development costs;
      (4)    Foster the safe, efficient, and economic use of land,
transportation, public facilities, and services;
      (5)    Encourage concentrated mixed-use land development patterns which
decrease the length of automobile travel, encourage public transportation,
allow trip consolidation and encourage pedestrian circulation between land
uses;
      (6)    Ensure a more rational and compatible relationship between
residential and non-residential uses for the mutual benefit of all;
      (7)    Further the economic development goals of the City;
      (8)    Allow for innovations in land development and redevelopment;
      (9)    Result in the formation or strengthening of identifiable and
robust neighborhoods in the Grandview Heights community; and
      (10)    Encourage new buildings and uses that reinforce the development
heritage of the community.
   (b)    Definitions.
      (1)    Planned Unit Development (PUD). A Planned Unit Development (PUD)
means any area of land within the jurisdiction of the City of Grandview Heights
in which one use or a variety of uses may be accommodated in a pre-planned
environment under more flexible standards than those restrictions that would
normally apply under this Zoning Code. The process in a PUD shall consist of
the filing of a Preliminary Development Plan which, if approved, shall
constitute the act of zoning; and a Final Development Plan which shall consist
of a detailed development plan for all or any portion of the area for which a
Preliminary Development Plan has been approved.
      (2)    Subarea. A Subarea is a distinct area of land within a PUD. Each
Subarea shall designate acreage, land use, development standards, architectural
standards, landscape standards, thoroughfare standards, conceptual road
alignments, gross density, and such other standards as may be required by the
Planning Commission and Council.
         (Ord.  2006-30.  Passed 9-5-06.)
   (c)    Permitted Uses.  Within the PUD Zoning District, permitted uses shall
include all uses allowable under the Zoning Ordinance that are approved through
the PUD approval process and are in conformity with the purpose and intent of
the Zoning Ordinance, and a compatible combination of any or all of these uses
provided that the proposed location of those uses will not adversely affect
adjacent property and/or the public health, safety and general welfare;
provided, however, that no uses that entail the commercial sale of firearms,
firearm components, or ammunition for firearms shall be permitted in areas
zoned for residential.
(Ord.  2019-31.  Passed 12-18-19.)
   (d)    Ownership.  A Planned Unit Development shall be in joint or common
ownership or control at the time the Preliminary Development Plan application
is made for a Planned Unit Development District, or where joint or common
ownership and/or control does not exist, each owner within the Planned Unit
Development shall sign the Preliminary Development Plan application. Any
transfer of land within the development resulting in ownership by two or more
parties after an application has been filed shall not alter the applicability
of the regulations contained herein. A Preliminary Development Plan or Final
Development Plan approved hereunder shall be binding upon the applicant(s) and
their successors and assigns, and shall limit and control the issuance and
validity of all certificates of zoning approval.
   (e)    General Procedures.  Procedures and conditions set forth for
determination of Planned Unit Development Districts and development(s) therein
shall be strictly followed, except when the Planning Commission and Council
have reviewed, discussed and approved a written statement submitted by the
applicant with the Preliminary Development Plan application clearly showing
that such procedures or conditions do not apply in the specific case.
   (f)    Procedure for Approval of a Planned Unit Development (PUD).  The
following procedures shall be used to secure approval of a Planned Unit
Development (PUD) and the appropriate changes of zoning resulting therefrom:
      (1)    First review.  Prior to submitting an application for a zoning
amendment that seeks a PUD designation, the applicant shall submit a letter to
the Director of Building and Zoning requesting review and feedback on the
proposed development from the Planning Commission. The meeting shall be known
as the “First Review” and shall occur at a date that that is no more than
thirty (30) days following the receipt of the letter by the Director of
Building and Zoning. The first review may occur either during a regular meeting
of the Planning Commission, or at a special meeting.
The purpose of the First Review shall be to provide an opportunity for the
applicant to outline the basic scope, character, and nature of the proposed
project in order to receive reaction and feedback from the Planning Commission
in the formative stages of project design. No discussions, opinions, or
suggestions provided during the First Review shall bind the applicant or the
City in any respect, and shall not have any bearing on the City’s ability to
approve or disapprove any subsequent applications that may be filed by the
applicant.
      (2)    Filing of Preliminary Development Plan; staff report. The
Preliminary Development Plan application, together with the required supporting
materials, shall be filed with the Director of Building and Zoning. Said
submittal shall include PDF or similar electronic formats. After determining
that the application is complete, the Director shall forward the application to
the Clerk of Council. The Clerk of Council shall draft an ordinance concerning
the requested zoning change and, at Council’s first regular or special meeting
that occurs at least thirty (30) days following the filing of the complete
application, the Preliminary Development Plan, accompanying documents, and
ordinance shall be forwarded to the Planning Commission for study and
recommendation. Copies of relevant aspects of the Preliminary Development Plan
shall also be forwarded to all interested City departments, which shall provide
information and comment to the Director of Building and Zoning to be included
in a comprehensive staff report, which shall be forwarded to the Planning
Commission within a reasonable time prior to the date when that body makes a
recommendation to Council, as set forth in this section.
      (3)    Recommendation by Planning Commission.  The Planning Commission
shall have a reasonable time, not to exceed sixty (60) days following its
receipt at a regular or special meeting of an ordinance from Council, to
consider the ordinance and the Preliminary Development Plan at a public hearing
and to report its recommendations to Council, unless such time period is
extended by mutual agreement of the parties. The Planning Commission shall take
one of the following actions with respect to the ordinance and the Preliminary
Development Plan:
         A.    Recommend approval of the ordinance and the Preliminary
Development Plan as submitted; or
         B.    Recommend approval of the ordinance and Preliminary Development
Plan with specific conditions as set forth in its record, for transmission to
Council and as agreed to by the applicant, to further protect and improve the
proposed and surrounding developments; or
         C.    Recommend disapproval of the ordinance and the Preliminary
Development Plan.
      (4)    Council action.  At such time as the recommendation of the
Planning Commission is received by Council, Council shall establish a date for
public hearing on the ordinance and the Preliminary Development Plan by giving
notice in the same manner as is required for any application for zoning
amendment in the City. Such public hearing on the ordinance and Preliminary
Development Plan by Council shall be heard within sixty (60) days after the
receipt of the recommendation of the Commission, unless such time period is
extended by mutual agreement of the parties. The Preliminary Development Plan
and the ordinance, along with the report of the recommendations of the Planning
Commission, shall be available for public inspection in the office of Clerk of
Council for a period of thirty (30) days immediately preceding the public
hearing. After consideration of all relevant documentation, Council shall
approve the ordinance and Preliminary Development Plan as submitted, approve
the ordinance and Preliminary Development Plan with specific conditions and/or
modifications as agreed to by the applicant, or disapprove the ordinance and
the Preliminary Development Plan.
      (5)    Effect of approval.  Adoption of the ordinance including the
Preliminary Development Plan shall constitute a rezoning of the property
included therein. The development standards approved as a part of the
Preliminary Development Plan shall apply, to the exclusion of any conflicting
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.  To the extent that these development
standards are silent on any matter, the pertinent provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance shall be applied. Prior to the development or the construction of
improvements contained in the Preliminary Development Plan, the applicant shall
be required to comply with the provisions of subsection (6) hereof.
      (6)    Final Development Plan.  Final Development Plans are intended to
be detailed representations of and in conformance with all aspects of the
approved Preliminary Development Plan. Said submittal shall include PDF or
similar electronic formats. Following receipt of a Final Development Plan
application and the required accompanying documents from the Director of
Building and Zoning, it shall be the duty of the Planning Commission to review
such plan and determine whether it complies with regulations of this chapter,
that it represents a detailed and precise expansion and delineation of the
previously approved Preliminary Development Plan, and that it complies with all
conditions which may have been given at the time of approval of the Preliminary
Development Plan.
         A.    Timing.  Within three (3) years of notice of approval of the
Preliminary Development Plan, the applicant shall submit a Final Development
Plan for a substantive part of the development. Upon good cause shown by the
applicant and by a majority vote of the Planning Commission, the Planning
Commission may extend the three-year period if the request is submitted prior
to the expiration date. In the event progress on the PUD is discontinued, the
City may begin procedures to rezone the property to the zoning district in
place prior to the Planned Unit Development District or to another district, as
may be determined appropriate.
         B.    Application. At any time after the approval of the Preliminary
Development Plan (subject to the time constraints and restrictions set forth
above), an applicant may file a Final Development Plan application, together
with the required supporting materials, with the Director of Building and
Zoning. Copies of the Final Development Plan application and supporting
documentation shall be forwarded to all interested City departments, which
shall provide information and comment to the Director of Building and Zoning to
be included in a comprehensive staff report, which shall be forwarded to the
Planning Commission at its first regularly scheduled or special meeting that is
at least thirty (30) days following the date on which said application was
filed.
         C.    Planning Commission Action.  Within sixty (60) days following
the receipt of at a regular or special meeting the Final Development Plan
application, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing and take
action on the Final Development Plan application. In taking action on the
application, the Planning Commission shall approve the Final Development Plan
application and its supporting documentation as submitted, approve the Final
Development Plan and its supporting documentation with specific conditions as
agreed to by the applicant, or disapprove the Final Development Plan
application and its supporting documentation.
         D.    Effect of Approval. If the Planning Commission finds that the
Final Development Plan meets the criteria for approval as set forth in this
Chapter, it shall approve the plan and the Planning Commission chair, vice
chair or designee shall affix his/her signature and approval date thereto
attesting to such approval. Following approval of the Final Development Plan
and the attestation of such action by the Commission chair, vice chair or
designee, the applicant shall provide one Mylar copy of all plans as well as
digital AutoCAD or other CAD program as may be requested by the City and PDF
files or other image formats as may be requested by the City (e.g., TIFF files)
as part of the Final Development Plan for the records of the City. Approval of
the Final Development Plan for a property shall entitle the applicant and its
successors, assigns, and designees to develop that property in accordance with
that plan and any conditions of approval attached thereto.
At any time, the applicant and its successors in title to any property for
which a Final Development Plan has been approved may submit an amended
Preliminary Development Plan. In such event, the same procedures shall be
followed as in the case of an original Preliminary Development Plan and, if
approved, such amended Preliminary Development Plan shall in all respects be
considered as if it were the originally adopted Preliminary Development Plan.
         E.   Revisions to Preliminary Development Plan. In the event that the
details of a Final Development Plan necessitate minor revisions of portions of
the approved Preliminary Development Plan located inside or outside of the area
to be included within boundaries of the Final Development Plan, then those
revisions may be approved by the Planning Commission in conjunction with its
approval of the Final Development Plan. In considering such revisions, the
Planning Commission may authorize minor modifications to the Preliminary
Development Plan that are required to correct any undetected errors, are
consistent with the Community Plan and the purpose of the approved Preliminary
Development Plan, or that are necessary to ensure orderly and efficient
development. “Minor modifications” shall be limited to those subjects addressed
in the original Preliminary Development Plan, including but not limited to:
            1.   Minor adjustments in subarea or lot lines, provided no
additional subareas or lots are created;
            2.   Minor adjustments in location of building footprints and
parking lots provided the perimeter setbacks, yards, and buffers remain in
compliance with applicable requirements;
            3.   Minor adjustments in building heights;
            4.   A substitution of landscaping materials;
            5.   A redesign and/or relocating stormwater management facilities;
            6.   Minor modifications to the design of signs, including sign
face, sign lighting, and color palette, provided that the maximum sign area and
maximum sign height, as specified and approved in the Preliminary Development
Plan are not exceeded; and
            7.   Minor changes in building material that are similar to and
have the same general appearance and durability as the material approved on the
Preliminary Development Plan.
   (g)    Basis of Plan Approval.

Community Plan or portion(s) thereof as may apply;
         C.    That the proposed development advances the economic development
and fiscal goals of the City;
         D.    That the benefits, improved arrangement, and design of the
proposed development justify deviation from standard development requirements
included in the Zoning Ordinance;
         E.    Where applicable, the relationship of buildings and structures
to each other and to such other facilities are appropriate;
         F.    That traffic and pedestrian circulation systems within the
proposed project are appropriate to serve the subject site and the surrounding
area;
         G.    That the following development standards that are to apply to
the project are adequate to ensure the orderly development of the subject site
and will not adversely affect adjacent property and/or the public health,
safety and general welfare:
            1.   Building heights of all structures;
            2.   Front, side and rear yard definitions and uses where they
occur at the development periphery;

that existing and anticipated non-residential development and traffic
improvements will be developed in a manner that is consistent with the goals,
objectives, and planning principles of the Grandview Heights Community Plan.
The importance of making the business and residential areas of the community
more physically and perceptibly cohesive, to provide for the long-term vitality
and viability of Grandview Heights Business Districts, and to encourage
expanded business options through creative adaptations of existing structures,
requires both flexibility in the zoning requirements, and a special emphasis on
integrated development, shared parking areas, and urban design.
   (c)   Definitions. The following definitions apply to this Chapter:
      (1)   Development.  Includes the construction of any new building or the
enlargement, alteration, or relocation or any existing structure; loading

standards, design guidelines contained herein, and accepted planning
principles. The Planning Commission shall endeavor to ensure that the exterior
appearance and environment of such buildings, structures and spaces will:
            1.   Enhance the attractiveness and desirability of the district in
keeping with its purpose and intent,
            2.   Encourage the orderly and harmonious development of the
district in keeping with the improving character of the district,
            3.   Improve residential amenities in any adjoining residential

construction of site improvements must be commenced within two  years of
Planning Commission approval; otherwise no development of the land shall take
place until a new Site Plan is approved pursuant to this section.
         B.   Approval of the Planning Commission is required before any
modification of the approved Site Plan may be made. Development of land or
structure shall not proceed prior to final approval of the Site Plan. Any
development undertaken without such final approval is in violation of this
zoning ordinance and is an abatable nuisance.
      (6)   Modifications of development standards and design guidelines. The
development standards guidelines contained in this chapter are derived from the
Community Plan and shall be used by any applicant in preparing a development
plan and by the Planning Commission in reviewing the same. This chapter
contains both development standards, which set forth specific requirements, and
design guidelines, which define a framework. Both the standards and guidelines
shall be interpreted with flexibility. The Planning Commission shall view the
standards and guidelines of this chapter as tools, since exceptional situations
requiring unique interpretations are expected. Modifications to the development
standards and design guidelines contained in this chapter may be approved by
the Planning Commission.
      (7)   Appeal. Any party with standing, including the administrative staff
of the City, aggrieved or affected by the decision of the Planning Commission
involving an application for a site plan review may appeal to Council by filing
notice of intent to appeal within seven days and filing a petition with the
Clerk of Council within fifteen days from the time of decision and setting
forth the facts of the case. Council shall schedule and attempt to hold a
public hearing on such appeal not later than thirty days after such appeal has
been filed with the Clerk of Council. The Council may reverse, remand, or
modify such decision and shall state the reason therefore. In the event that
the Planning Commission has disapproved an application, it shall take the
favorable vote of three-fourths (6 of 7) of all members of Council.
(Ord. 98-13. Passed 9-8-98.)
1157.07  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND DESIGN GUIDELINES.
   The following standards and guidelines are provided as: (1) guidelines for
consideration by applicants in preparing site plans, and (2) criteria to be
considered by the Director of Building and Zoning and the Planning Commission
in reviewing site plans.
   (a)   Purpose. To ensure that all development plans and traffic layouts are
in conformance with the general recommendations of the Grandview Heights
Community Plan, which constitutes the development plan for the City’s Business
Districts.
   (b)   Development standards.
      (1)   Lot area and width. No specific standard is recommended since the
City is almost fully developed; each application will be considered on a case-
by-case basis. However, prior to the approval of a lot split or lot
consolidation, it must be demonstrated that the development of the new lot will
not adversely impact surrounding development and be in conformance with the
guidelines of this chapter.
      (2)   Side and rear yard areas. Side and rear yard areas must be
sufficient to adequately serve as a buffer adjacent to residential development.
         A.   In the C-1, C-2, and C-3 Districts there is no standard
recommended for side yard areas, although there must be consideration for fire
fighting equipment to reach the rear yard. This area must be kept clear for the
passage and use of fire equipment for a width of not less than eight feet.
Buildings next to residential or open space areas should provide a side yard of
eight feet. The minimum rear yard standard is twenty percent (20%) of the lot
depth, but need not exceed twenty-five feet.
         B.   In the M-1 District, main and accessory structures should
maintain side and rear yard areas that are proportional to the height and width
or height and depth of the structure, especially when located adjacent to a
residential area. The minimum side yard standard in this District is one-third
the height and depth of the structure. The minimum rear yard standard is one-
third the height and width of the structure.
         C.   For both cases, the minimum side and rear yard standard is
fifteen feet from the interior lot lines and twenty-five feet to any
residential zoning district.
      (3)   Front yard areas. The minimum and maximum front yard standard is
determined by the average of existing building setbacks. In most instances, the
Planning Commission may require new or expanded development to build to the
setback of the existing building or, where there is precedent, structures may
be required to be extended toward the street right-of-way. Front yards are to
be devoted to landscape areas and the necessary paving of driveways and
sidewalks to reach parking or loading areas in the side or rear yard.
      (4)   Maximum lot coverage. No specific guidelines are recommended so
long as it is demonstrated that the development will not adversely impact
surrounding development and will be in conformance with the guidelines of this
chapter.
      (5)   Maximum height. The standard is thirty-five feet when adjacent to
residential districts and forty-five feet in other instances.
      (6)   Parking setback line. The parking setback line establishes how
close parking, loading, or maneuvering may be located to a street right-of-way
line. In C-1, C-2, C-3, and M-1 zoning districts, the parking setback line is
established ten feet from the right-of-way line.
      (7)   Open service and outdoor storage. These areas should not exceed ten
percent (10%) of the lot area in commercial districts; twenty-five percent
(25%) in manufacturing district.
      (8)   Off-street parking spaces. Off-street parking spaces are to be
provided as follows:
         A.    Restaurants: One parking space for each 250 square feet of floor
area.
         B.   Private Club: One parking space for each 400 square feet of floor
area.
         C.   Church or Other Place of Worship, Auditoriums, Theaters, and
Other Places of Public Assembly: One parking space for each five seats.
         D.   Nursing Home, Residential Care Facility, Hospice: One-half space
for each bed.
         E.    Community Center, Library, Museum, or Similar Public or Semi-
public Building: One parking space for each 300 square feet of floor area in
the building.
         F.   Medical Office Building: Buildings in which twenty percent (20%)
or more of the gross area is occupied by members of the healing profession; one
parking space for each 200 square feet of the gross area used for this purpose.
         G.   Professional and Administrative Offices: One per 300 square feet
of floor area.
         H.   Bank: One per 250 square feet of floor area.
         I.   Retail Store: One parking space for each 250 square feet of floor
area.
         J.   Vehicle Sales: One parking space per 300 square feet of floor
area plus one space per 1,000 square feet of outdoor display.
         K.   Vehicle Repair: Three parking spaces per each service bay.

written agreement must be approved by the City Attorney and accepted by the
Planning Commission. The written agreement will be filed along with the
application for a Certificate of Occupancy.
   (c)   Design Guidelines.
      (1)   Traffic concept. All points of ingress and egress onto public
roadways and the overall distribution scheme shall be shown, indicating traffic
patterns and potential traffic control points. The criteria that must be
followed include:
         A.   Combined access points to the public right-of-way
         B.   Driveway/access easements to be provided for adjoining parcels
         C.   Minimization of conflict points between auto traffic and
pedestrian traffic to include adequate design and demarcation of pedestrian
walkways from parking or driveway area

         E.   Street improvements that may be required by the Planning
Commission if site and traffic conditions warrant.
         F.   Buffering and screening, or other treatment to lessen impact on
residential areas.
      (2)   Screening. The intent of this provision is to improve the
appearance of parking areas and property abutting public rights-of-way and to
require buffering between non-compatible land uses in order to mitigate
negative visual impacts upon adjacent properties and along the public rights-
of- way.
         A.   All non-residential establishments shall be required to enclose
all outdoor refuse containers on a minimum of three adjoining sides. This
enclosure shall be constructed to maintain a minimum three- foot clearance
between itself and the dumpster, and shall be at least one foot higher than the
highest part of the refuse container or containers enclosed. Such enclosures
shall be constructed of solid and opaque wood or material similar to that of
which the principle building is constructed. Construction-grade plain faced
concrete will not be permitted.
         B.   All parking lots and driving areas shall be screened along
adjacent streets with a continuous three-foot average-height planting, hedge,
fence or wall.
         C.   All open service areas, outdoor storage areas, or loading docks
shall be screened by walls or fences, six feet minimum height, eight feet
maximum height, that effectively conceal such operations from adjacent streets
or adjacent residential districts.
      (3)   Parking layout. A detailed parking layout must be shown to include
the following:
         A.   Total number of on-site spaces.
         B.   Access points and expected movement through and between separate
parking lot areas.
         C.   Opportunities for shared parking areas between two or more
separate uses.
      (4)   Parking area landscaping.
         A.   All parking lots shall provide, in addition to screening
requirements, two-inch dbh (diameter, breast height) tree trunk size for every
six parking spaces. All trees shall be balled and burlapped. The minimum dbh of
any tree shall be two inches.
         B.   Planting beds for parking lot trees shall be constructed so as to
distribute landscaping throughout the parking lot and to minimum damage to
trunks and roots of the trees from vehicles, pedestrians, and parking lot
maintenance through the use of adequate soil planting area and curbing or
parking blocks. Planting soil area per tree shall be a minimum of forty-five
square feet. The minimum dimension for the planting area shall be five feet on
any one side. All trees shall be maintained in a healthy condition.
         C.   Any lot with a minimum dimension of fifty feet on any one side
shall have at least one tree planting per 6,000 square feet of paved surface.
The minimum distance between deciduous trees, located in separate planting
beds, shall be thirty-six feet. Additional landscaping, trees, ground cover,
hedge or evergreens may be located between deciduous trees.
      (5)   Lighting. Any parking area with ten or more off-street parking
spaces shall be illuminated during poor visibility to provide an average
intensity of one-half foot candle of light as measured at the parking surface
area. All outdoor lighting shall be of constant intensity and shall be
directed, reflected or shielded so as not to be of excessive brightness or
cause glare hazardous to pedestrians or drivers, or create a nuisance, or
unreasonably interfere with a neighboring property owner’s right to enjoy his
property. All lighting shall be shielded so that no glare will extend to any
adjacent property.  In residential districts, no light shall be located higher
than fifteen feet above ground level,
      (6)   Utilities. The site plan must also consider the relocation of
existing utility poles along public streets to locations along the side or rear
of the properties to be served.
      (7)   Signs. As regulated by the sign regulations, signage will be most
significant in communicating the character of the district. Signage should be
discreet and minimal. Colors should be subdued, and where appropriate, the
architectural character of the sign should be consistent with that of the
building. Signs flush with the building face are in many cases preferable to
projecting or ground signs. It is also preferred that ground signs be installed
on bases and supporting structures that consist of brick, stone or wood, or be
screened with evergreens to the top of the anchor bolts.
      (8)   Exterior design. The design treatment of the site and all proposed
or renovated structures shall ensure compatibility and sensitivity to adjacent
properties and structures.
(Ord. 98-13. Passed 9-8-98.)
1157.08  FENCE REGULATIONS.

   (g)   Every swimming pool, including existing swimming pools, shall be
completely enclosed by a fence of sturdy construction not less than forty-five
inches in height, measured from the level of the ground where located, which
shall be of such design and construction as to effectively prevent a child from
crawling or otherwise passing through or under such fence. Each gate in such
fence shall be provided with a secure lock and shall be kept locked at all
times when the depth of water in the pool exceeds eighteen inches, unless such
pool is in use or is under the immediate observation of a responsible person.

1157.09.01  PURPOSE.
   The Grandview Commerce Mixed Use District (District) was created to enable a
mixed-use commerce area on the vacated manufacturing zone at the east end of
the City. This District presents an opportunity to attract a large employment
base while at the same time building a vibrant neighborhood that will
complement the balance of the City. The Grandview Heights Commerce District
Plan adopted in 2005 in support of the Grandview Heights Community Plan clearly
articulates the objectives and planning principles of the community and as such
constitutes the purpose of this District.
   The Grandview Heights Commerce District Plan establishes the planning and
design framework for the District. Infrastructure such as streets, parking, and
water and sewer along with design elements such as connectivity, walkability,
and places for people, will be used to guide development within the planning
framework of the Grandview Heights Commerce District Plan. The regulatory
approach of the District is in keeping with the vision of mixed use
developments which require a more flexible and innovative approach than can be
provided by more traditional zoning techniques. The framework and principles of
this District were adopted rather than traditional standards in the belief that
greater flexibility will lead to better results.
   The District helps ensure the implementation of the vision called for by the
Grandview Heights Commerce District Plan. To achieve this vision, the District
and any future standards shall adhere to the following general principles:
   (a)    The District should be an energized urban district consisting of a
mix of land uses, diverse development, a grid of streets and pedestrian
connections, attractive development and public spaces, energized activity and
graphics, and respect for the existing neighborhood edge to the west and
commercial edge to the north.
   (b)    The District should always permit a diverse mix of land uses and
development.
      (1)    The District should allow for redevelopment that utilizes a mix of
uses including employment-oriented office, medical and technology-centered
office, national, regional and local retail, and range of residential uses.
      (2)    The District should allow for multiple-story buildings that may
integrate a vertical mix of uses.
   (c)    The development pattern for the District shall extend the existing
neighborhood street pattern and make appropriate connections with the rest of
the City.
      (1)    Yard Street will serve as the primary centerpiece street for
orienting buildings, spaces, pedestrian connections, activity, and graphics.
      (2)    Bobcat Avenue & Rail Street will provide access to the parking
reservoir areas and back of house operations and be attractively landscaped and
accommodate pedestrians.
      (3)    Streets and sidewalks surrounding the District shall be extended
and connected into the District in an attractive manner to reinforce its
integration into the community fabric.
      (4)    Goodale Boulevard will continue to serve as an existing arterial
city street for orienting buildings, spaces, pedestrian connections, activity
and graphics.
   (d)    Compatible, high-quality development will be a signature of the
District.
   (e)    The District will create a walkable district that is enhanced by a
quality public realm and open space.
      (1)    Public open space should consist of plazas, pocket parks, and
visual landscape relief to the surrounding built environment for the enjoyment
of residents and visitors to the District.
      (2)    This urban open space should be distributed throughout the
District.
   (f)    The District will be an energized, activated, and retail-supported
environment that encourages strolling, shopping, and people watching.
      (1)    The District should be supportive of opportunities for community
interaction, festivals, and gathering.
      (2)    The District will allow for vibrant graphics and signage that
attracts crowds and retail tenants.
   (g)    The District should respect the existing neighborhood edge to the
west, the offices and retail businesses on Goodale Boulevard, and the
commercial district to the north while taking advantage of the railroad tracks
to the east.
   (h)    Large Format Retail will be allowed (i) in the northern third of the
District, and (ii) with the approval of Planning Commission, in other areas of
the District. Retail uses of 20,000 square feet or less in floor space will be
permitted throughout the District.  (Ord.  2019-05.  Passed 2-4-19.)

1157.09.09  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (a)   General Street Principles.
      (1)    The neighborhood will be oriented along Yard Street as the main
feature street.
      (2)    North-south framework streets (i .e. Bobcat Avenue and Rail
Street) will allow vehicular commercial traffic to circulate between Goodale
Boulevard and Third Avenue. They will be landscaped and provide pedestrian
connectivity.
      (3)    East-west avenue extensions (i.e. Burr Avenue, Williams Avenue,
and Burrell Avenue/First Avenue) will be extended east into the District and
will connect with Bobcat Avenue, Yard Street and Rail Street, as depicted on
the District Framework Plan. These streets will provide pedestrian as well as
vehicular connectivity with the existing neighborhoods.
      (4)    Additional alleys will be included within the District to provide
service and access to portions of larger blocks. These alleys will be designed
to accommodate the level and type (e.g. vehicular, pedestrian) of traffic and
services anticipated.
      (5)    Goodale Boulevard will continue to serve as an existing arterial
city street for orienting building, spaces, pedestrian connections, activity
and graphics.
      (6)    A design element will be planned and constructed at the south
terminus of Yard Street and Bobcat Avenue.
   (b)    General Building Placement Principles.
      (1)    Building facades adjacent to designated primary frontages should
address the fronting street through the inclusion of entrances, architectural
detailing and/or special facade finishes.
         In the event a forecourt/greenspace is located between the primary
frontage and the building facade, then building entrances are not required at
the primary frontage provided architectural detailing and/or special facade
finishes are utilized on the building facade adjacent to the primary frontage.
      (2)    Building facades may be placed around an auto-court as long as a
landscape or architectural edge condition is maintained along the primary
frontage road.
      (3)    Pedestrian connections should be established between the parking
area and the sidewalk along the public right-of-way for the commercial building
which the parking area primarily serves.
      (4)    There are no setback standards as part of this District.
      (5)    Spaces between buildings within blocks Q-S through I should be
minimized except to allow green space/plazas, pedestrian access, or limited
building service drives. For Blocks J through M and Block T, landscape elements
may be used to hold the street edge in spaces between buildings along Yard
Street, W. Third Avenue, Swan Street and the Burrell Avenue/First Avenue
extension.
      (6)    Residential buildings may include multiple-story structures and be
incorporated into commercial buildings. Freestanding townhouses, apartments,
and/or condominiums should be oriented to public or private street frontage,
green space or courtyards.
   (c)    General Building Form and Massing Principles.
      (1)    The District may be supported by parking garages, joint & shared
parking arrangements, public or private parking areas and transit
opportunities.
      (2)    For all properties south of Goodale, building heights shall not
exceed eight (8) stories. For properties north of Goodale, building heights
shall not exceed four (4) stories west of Bobcat Street, eight stories west of
Yard Street and building heights are not limited east of Yard Street.
      (3)    Individual building lengths on Yard Street and the Burr, Williams,
& Burrell/ First Avenue extensions shall not exceed 300 feet at street level
without a break in the facade, which break shall be defined to include, but not
be limited to, a variation in facade, building entrance, forecourt or building
terminus.
   (d)    General Architectural Principles.
      (1)    Buildings should utilize a combination of facade modulation,
differentiation of the base zone, and provision of such elements as display
windows, balconies, arcades, and awnings at the base of the building.
      (2)    Windows shall use transparent glass on the first floor of a
commercial building.
      (3)    Mechanical equipment on the roof of a building shall be screened
from view from public right-of ways at the primary facade.
      (4)    All trash, service areas, and loading bays shall be screened.
      (5)    Building materials shall consist of primarily brick, stone, stucco
(smooth or sand finish), glass, a pre-cast masonry, pre-cast concrete, metal,
split-faced block, wood-lap siding, or fiber cement board.
   (e)    General Building Frontage Principles.
      (1)    Building projections, signs, balconies, awnings and bay windows
may encroach into the right-of-way.
      (2)    Gallery overhangs and arcades may encroach upon public right-of-
way and overlap the sidewalk provided they do not disrupt public use. A
pedestrian passageway with ten-foot vertical clearance must be maintained
underneath.
      (3)    Buildings with retail frontages may have varied storefronts
reflective of the tenant businesses.
      (4)    Parking lots shall be buffered from all public street frontages
with  building, wall, fence, landscaping, or mound.
   (f)    General Parking Principles.
      (1)   A parking strategy will be submitted with a plan addressing
adequate parking needs for the proposed development and how it fits with
existing and planned parking within the District. Shared parking between the
various blocks shall be permitted and the presence of shared parking and/or
public or private parking areas (including, but not limited to, on-street
parking) shall be considered when reviewing the adequacy of parking needs for
the proposed development.
      (2)    Along Yard Street in blocks A through I, off-street parking should
be located to the rear or side of a building.
      (3)    Large surface parking lots should have additional landscaping to
compensate and visually reduce the mass of the parking area.
      (4)    Temporary parking conditions for future phases are permitted.
      (5)     Public parking stall sizes may vary, but shall not be less than
8' -6' wide by 18' deep, and shall not be less than a 58-foot parking module.
      (6)    Curb-cut widths leading to off-street parking spaces shall be
minimized to encourage pedestrian cross movement and safety.
   (h)    General Landscape Principles.
      (1)    The Private Amenity Zone, where provided, shall include landscape
or hardscape that is complementary to the streetscape.
      (2)    Areas between commercial buildings shall include a pedestrian
plaza, pathway, or landscaping.
      (3)    Street trees may be removed in place of a gallery overhang or
arcade and substituted with lower landscaping.
   (i)    General Lighting Principles.
      (1)    All site lighting fixtures shall be cut-off in type.
      (2)    Building lighting may be used to highlight architectural features.

1167.01  SIGNS.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to provide standards to
safeguard life, health, property and public welfare by regulating and
controlling the design, quality of materials, location, installation and
maintenance of signs, as defined in Section
1133.02 .  The City recognizes that signs are important to the economic life
and welfare of the City; however, when placed in an improper manner or used to
an excessive extent, signs may be detrimental to the public safety and
welfare.  The public interest, conservation of property values, encouragement
of orderly city development, aesthetic values and protection of the public
health, safety and welfare therefore require that the use of signs be
regulated.
   The following signs are allowed in all districts:
      (1)   A maximum of one temporary sign, as defined in Section
1133.02(96), advertising the sale or lease of real estate, but only when
located upon real estate to which the sign refers and not located closer than
ten feet from an adjoining property.  Such signs shall be removed within ten
business days of the closing following the sale or lease of the property. 
Signs advertising the sale or lease of real estate for other than the property
on which they are displayed are prohibited and are in violation of this
section.
      (2)   Temporary ground signs advertising future use of development of
property on which such signs are located may be maintained subject to the
provisions of this section, provided such signs do not exceed thirty square
feet in area or remain longer than six months.  “For Rent” and “For Lease”
signs in commercial and industrial districts for new buildings shall not exceed
forty-eight square feet or remain more than ninety days after the building is
completed.
      (3)   Church or public building bulletin boards not exceeding twelve
square feet in area.
      (4)   Traffic and public signs.
      (5)   Home occupation signs as defined herein.
 
   (b)   In the RA Residential Districts, there may be one wall sign attached
to the building, projecting no more than twelve inches, not exceeding twenty-
five square feet in area and relating only to the name or use of the building.
 
   (c)   In the C-1, C-2, C-3 and M Districts, there may be ground signs, wall
signs, projecting signs, post signs, marquee signs, window and awning signs
when displaying no advertising matter except pertaining to the business
conducted in the building or on the premises on which such sign is placed.  The
total square foot area of ground signs, wall signs, projecting signs, marquee
signs and awning signs shall not exceed one-fifth of the total square foot area
of the face of the building on which they are placed.  There shall not be more
than one post sign for each 100 feet of street frontage.  No post sign shall
extend closer than ten feet to a lot line.  (Ord. 2017-03.  Passed 5-15-17.)
   (d)   The following additional sign regulations shall be observed:
      (1)   Awning signs.  One awning sign shall be permitted on a premises. 
The total area of one face of the sign shall not exceed six square feet and the
vertical dimension of the sign shall not exceed twelve inches.
      (2)   Billboard and roof signs.  Billboard and roof signs are prohibited
in all districts.
      (3)   Changeable copy signs.  Changeable copy is prohibited except for
bulletin boards and motion picture marquees.
      (4)   Gasoline service stations.  Gasoline service stations whose
principal business is the sale of motor fuel may display signs in addition to
those herein authorized.  Such signs shall be limited to the following:
         A.   One double-faced sign not exceeding five square feet on a side is
permitted for each set of motor fuel pumps identifying "self-service" or "full
service".
         B.   Signs, not exceeding three in number, with each sign being single
or double-faced having a total aggregate area including the sign frame and
surrounding surfaces of not more than fifteen square feet on each side are
permitted for the display of motor fuel price information.  The top of such
signs shall not extend more than five feet above the finished grade of the
service station.  Such signs may be fixed or portable but shall not be located
nearer to the street than the motor fuel pump islands that are nearest such
street and such signs shall not be internally illuminated.  These signs are
limited to the identification of the grade or type of motor fuel sold and the
price.
            (Ord. 94-33.  Passed 10-3-94.)
      (5)   Ground signs.  No ground sign shall impair or impede the safe and
ordinary flow of vehicular or pedestrian travel or traffic or extend higher
than six (6) feet above the finished grade.  Permanent ground signs shall not
be located within the required front and side yards unless approved by the
Planning Commission.  The total sign area shall not be more than sixty percent
(60%) of the total sign area allowed under subsection (d)(2) hereof.  The sixty
percent (60%) total sign area applies whether a ground sign is used exclusively
or in conjunction with other signs and is to be located not closer than ten
feet to an adjoining property line.  There shall be no more than one ground
sign per parcel. 
(Ord. 97-26.  Passed 9-2-97.)

1167.01(d)(6) was repealed by Ordinance 94-34, passed December 5, 1994.)
      (7)   Illumination.  Internally illuminated signs shall be constructed so
as to allow the illumination of only letters, numbers or other identifying
symbols on the display surface.  Internally illuminated signs shall not exceed
800 milliampere fluorescent tubes mounted not closer than twelve inches on
center.  External illumination shall be installed so that the light source is
not visible and reflects away from adjoining premises.  No external light
source shall be located or arranged so as to cause confusion or a hazard to
traffic.  No light shall pass through the background.
      (8)   Lettering and colors.  There shall be no more than two styles nor
three sizes of lettering used for any sign including characters or trademarks. 
No more than four colors, including black and white, shall be used.
      (9)   Marquee signs.  Marquees may extend eight feet into a front yard. 
Marquees shall be not less than eleven feet above the ground at its lowest
level.  A sign may be placed upon a marquee provided such sign does not extend
more than three feet above nor one foot below such marquee.
      (10)   Movement.  No sign shall incorporate movement or the illusion of
movement.  Flashing signs shall not be permitted. (Ord. 90-44.  Passed 9-4-90.)
      (11)   Numerical address. The owner of any commercial, industrial or
public building abutting upon the streets within the corporate limits of the
City shall display in a conspicuous place on the front side of such building a
permanent sign displaying the numerical address of the building in Arabic
numbers not less than four (4) inches and no more than twelve (12) inches in
height. The color of the numbers shall be in contrast to the color of the
surface on which they are mounted and the view of the numbers shall be
unobstructed from the street on which the building is numbered. Signs within
this specification shall not require a permit.
(Ord. 2009-41. Passed 3-1-10.)
      (12)   Off-premises signs.  Off-premises signs are prohibited.
      (13)   Paper posters and certain signs or devices prohibited.  Paper
posters applied directly to the wall, building, pole or other support and
letters or pictures in the form of advertising, printed or applied directly on
the wall of a building are prohibited.  Temporary signs may be displayed in or
attached to the inside of show or display windows provided the total sign area
does not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the show or display window area.  Signs
or devices which by color, location or design resemble or conflict with traffic
control signs or devices are prohibited.  No sign shall contain flashers,
animators, mechanical movements or contrivances of any kind, excepting clocks.
         (Ord. 90-44.  Passed 9-4-90.)
      (14)   Pennants/streamers/banners. Pennants, streamers and banners are

the design, construction and erection of every new graphic, sign, marquee,
canopy and awning, is to cause every graphic or other sign in violation of any
provision of this chapter to be removed, altered or replaced so as to conform
with the provisions of this chapter.
      (1)   Authority to continue existing nonconformities.  Any permanent
graphic, sign, marquee, canopy or awning other than a temporary sign, which is
deemed to be a nonconformity, which was erected pursuant to a City permit and
in place on the effective date of this chapter, and which remains or becomes a
nonconformity upon the adoption of this chapter or any subsequent amendment
thereto, may be continued only in accordance with the following regulations:
         A.   Repairs.  Ordinary repairs and nonstructural alterations may be

or upon such nonconforming sign, except those required by law to make the sign
conform to the regulations of this chapter.

added to or enlarged in any manner, except to make the sign conform to the

that such damage or destruction is less than sixty percent (60%) of the
original cost of such sign, no repairs or construction shall be made unless
such restoration is started within six months from the date of the partial
destruction and is diligently pursued to completion.
         E.   Discontinuance of use of nonconforming signs.  A nonconforming
sign, the use of which is discontinued for a period of thirty days, shall

identity associated with the nonconforming sign at the time of the adoption of
this chapter thereafter terminates or changes, such termination or change of
use shall require termination of the nonconforming sign, and the use of such
sign shall thereafter conform to the regulations of this chapter.
         G.   Conformance date.  All graphics, signs, marquees, canopies and
awnings rendered nonconforming by the provisions of this chapter are hereby
declared a nuisance and shall be removed, altered or remodeled to conform to
the provisions of this chapter no later than January 1, 1995.
         H.   When a structure and/or use is nonconforming and the signage
restrictions for the district in which it is located would cause hardship, the
regulations of the district most compatible with the current and/or proposed
use shall be used.
         I.   Any sign, graphic or numeral display embossed, etched, engraved
or otherwise an integral part of the original building's masonry architecture
which was in existence prior to the effective date of this subsection (e) may
be continued provided such sign, graphic or numeral display is maintained as
originally designed and intended.
         J.   Penalty.  Any person, firm or corporation violating the
provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined
not more than two hundred dollars ($200.00) for each offense.  Each day that a

   (d)   Emergency Orders.
      (1)   Whenever the Housing Inspector finds that an emergency exists which
requires immediate action to protect the public health and safety or the health
and safety of any person, he may issue an order reciting the existence of such
an emergency and requiring that such action as he deems necessary be taken to
meet the emergency.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Housing Code,

emergency to exist have been abated and approved by the Housing Inspector.
      (3)   In cases where it reasonably appears that there is imminent danger
to the public health and safety or the health and safety of any person unless
the emergency condition is immediately corrected and if after reasonable
attempts to notify the owner it appears that the owner will not or cannot
immediately correct the condition, the Housing Inspector may cause the
immediate abatement, including building demolition, of such emergency
condition.  The Housing Inspector shall further cause the cost of such
abatement to be charged against the land on which the building exists as a
municipal lien or to be recovered in a civil suit against the owner.
   (e)   Retaliatory Eviction.  No owner, or person having control, of any
premises regulated by this Code shall institute any action to recover
possession of the premises or otherwise willfully cause a tenant to quit a
habitation involuntarily, demand an increase in rent from a tenant, decrease
services to which a tenant has been entitled, or increase the obligations of a
tenant, in retaliation against a tenant's good faith complaint or report of
conditions in, or affecting his dwelling unit which might reasonably be
believed to constitute a violation of a housing, building, health, or other
code or ordinance made to a governmental authority or to the owner.  Provided,
however, that this subsection shall not apply:

governmental authority or to the owner subsequent to the receipt of a written
notice to leave the premises; or

installed in or about the premises other than by the occupant or other costs of
operation of the premises.
   (f)   Fire Insurance Claim.
      (1)   No insurance company doing business in the State of Ohio shall pay

City where the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the
company or companies is more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) and equal or
exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the aggregate limits of liability on all fire
policies covering the structure unless there is compliance with subsection (f)
(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   The insurance company or companies in accordance with Division (F)
of Ohio R. C. 715.26 shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Mayor in

insurance company or companies the named insured or insureds have submitted a
contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing, or securing
the building or other structure, shall transfer from the insurance proceeds the

companies insuring the building or other structure.
      (3)   Upon receipt of proceeds by the Mayor as authorized by this
section, the Mayor shall deposit same with the Finance Director who shall place
the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely as security against the total

the City pursuant to Ohio  R. C. 715.261.
         A.   When transferring the funds as required in this subsection, an
insurance company shall provide the Mayor with the name and address of the

or insureds, certify that the proceeds have been received by the City and
notify them that the following procedures will be followed:
         B.   The fund shall be returned to the named insured or insureds when
repairs, or removal, or securing of the building or other structure have been
completed and approved by the Mayor, if the City has not incurred any costs for
such repairs, removal, or securing.  If the City has incurred any costs for
repairs, removal, or securing of the building or other structure, such costs
shall be paid from the fund and if excess funds remain, the City shall transfer
the remaining funds to the named insured or insureds.  Nothing in this
subsection shall be construed to limit the ability of the City to recover any
deficiency under Ohio R. C. 715.261.
         C.   Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the
City and the named insured or insureds from entering into agreement that
permits the transfer of funds to the named insured or insureds if some other
reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been negotiated.

1339.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens.  Therefore, the City of Grandview Heights, State of Ohio, does ordain
this Chapter.   
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The City of Grandview Heights has special flood
hazard areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss
of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.   
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and  property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
Construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the City of
Grandview Heights as identified in Section
1339.01(f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
the City of Grandview Heights.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map for Franklin County and Incorporated
Areas and Flood Insurance Study for Franklin County and Incorporated Areas
dated March 16, 2004.
      (2)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio that has been approved by
the City of Grandview Heights as required by Section
1339.04(c) “Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.”  Any revisions to the
aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted by reference and declared
to be a part of these regulations.  Such maps and/or studies are on file at the
City of Grandview Heights, Department of Building and Zoning, 1016 Grandview
Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43212.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes.  In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed.  These
regulations shall not intend to impair any deed restriction covenant or
easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the
regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes.  Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a State or Federal law, such State or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on  scientific and engineering considerations.  Larger floods can
and will occur on rare  occasions.  Flood heights may be increased by man-made
or natural causes.  These  regulations do not imply that land outside the areas
of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage.  These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Grandview Heights, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
hereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 04-05.  Passed 2-17-04.)
1339.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   “Accessory Structure” means a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure or
use and which is located on the same lot with such principal structure or use.
   (b)   “Appeal” means a request for review of the floodplain administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   “Base Flood” means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.  The base flood may also be referred to
as the one percent (1%) chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   “Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)” means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the Northern American Vertical
Datum of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL).  In Zone AO
areas, the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth
number (from 1 to 3 feet).

storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   “Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor” see  “Lowest Floor”.
   (h)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)” issued by President
Carter in 1977, this Order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)” means the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   “Fill” means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   “Flood” or “Flooding” means a  general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)” means an initial map produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means an official map on which the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood Insurance Risk Zones” means zone designations on FHBMs and
FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community.  Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood 
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage areas less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the
500- year floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS)” means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency has provided flood profiles, floodway
boundaries and the water surface elevations of the base flood.
   (p)   “Flood Protection Elevation (FPE)”is the base flood elevation plus one
and one half (1-1/2) feet of freeboard.  In areas where no base flood
elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation 
can  be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/
or  approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge.  A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height.  In no case shall the designated height be more than one half (1/2)
foot at any point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following:  Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard” means the factor of safety usually expressed in feet above
a flood level for the purposes of floodplain management.  Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic Structure” means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio’s inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis” means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC)” means an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.  LOMC’s are broken down into
the following categories:
•   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) means a revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area.  A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
•   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) means a revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevation, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features.  One
common type of LOMR, an LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      •   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) means a formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria.  A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   “Lowest Floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure.  This definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other
than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with
the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured Home” means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities.  The
term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle”.  For the
purpose of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   “Manufactured Home Park” as specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27- 01, means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured
homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue
purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure
used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park.  A tract of
land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but
are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on
the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though three or more
manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the
local government authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)” is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding.  This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods. 
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   “New Construction” means structures for which the “start of
construction” commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of
Grandview Heights ’Flood Insurance Rate Map dated August 15, 1980 and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   “Person” includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies.  An agency is further defined in Ohio Revised
Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but
is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau,
society, council, institution, state college or university, community college
district, technical college district, or state community college.  “Agency”
does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the Adjutant
General’s Department, or any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational Vehicle” means a vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
   (cc)   “Registered Professional Architect” means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01
to 4703.19 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (dd)   “Registered Professional Engineer” means a person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ee)   “Registered Professional Surveyor” means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ff)   “Special Flood Hazard Area”, also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, means the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year.  Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30 and A99.  Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from
other Federal, State or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of Construction” means the date the building permit was
issued, provided  the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date.  The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured  home on a
foundation.  Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.  For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   “Structure” means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   “Substantial Damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial Improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of
construction” of the improvement.  This term includes structures, which have
incurred “substantial damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed. 
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered “new 
construction”;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code  specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a “historic structure” provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure”.
   (kk)   “Variance” means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 04-05.  Passed 2-17-04.)

such as labeling or planimetric details.  Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Grandview Heights, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment: Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Grandview Heights have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area.  In order that the
City of Grandview Heights’ Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represents the
City of Grandview Heights’ boundaries, include within such notification a copy
of the map of the City of Grandview Heights suitable for reproduction, clearly
showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which the City of
Grandview Heights has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory
authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation:The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been in identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
Federal, State, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and 
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations.  Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA, the
preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously existing
flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering these
regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevation or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA.  Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard.  A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1339.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations:  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including tornado, wind, heavy snow, flood, fire,
etc.  After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair
process.  These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Grandview Heights and
the Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
      (2)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. 
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
“bankfull stage”.  The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based
on methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites:  An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source.  For all proposed developments that  alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished.  Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.

      (1)   Any person who has legal standing a particular matter and who is
adversely affected by any notice and order, or other official action of the
Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a hearing on the
matter before the Commission provided that such person shall file, within
twenty (20) days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such appeal or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any Order of the Floodplain Administrator.  Such
appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator.  Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made to the Commission.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Commission shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.   Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance.  The Commission shall have the power to authorize,
in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not
inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public
interest where, due to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary
hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Commission.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information:  Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the schedule of fees in Section
1141.05 of the Codified Ordinances..
      (2)   Standards for Review.  In passing upon such applications, the
Commission shall consider all evaluations, all relevant factors and standards
specified in other sections of this Chapter, and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury  of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use,
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan
and Floodplain Management Program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant.  Increased cost or inconvenience of
meeting the requirements of these regulations does not constitute an
exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this Chapter,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be made on a lot of one-half acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing items in Section
1339.05(d)(2)(A – K) have been fully considered.  As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
      (5)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of this
Chapter, the Commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances
as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this Chapter.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A record of the proceedings shall be kept.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Commission shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses.  A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance
and service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Commission’s decision may be announced at the conclusion of the
hearing and thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in
writing within a reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.   Any party with legal standing aggrieved by the
decision of the Commission may appeal such decision to the Franklin County
Court of Common Pleas, as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

1705.10  ANIMAL BITE REPORTING PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Section 3701-3-02 of the Ohio Administrative Code requires all animal
bites to be reported to the local health department.
   (b)   When a report of a bite is received, fill out the “Animal Bite” card
as completely as possible.  Along with the type of animal, also get a
description, i.e. long haired, brown and white toy terrier.  If the rabies tag
number is available, make certain the expiration date is obtained.  Note the
location the animal is being kept.  Also note if the bite occurred off the
owners premises.  If the animal is at home, it must be quarantined.  If it is
going to the animal shelter, or if it was picked up by the Animal Warden, the
animal must stay confined at the shelter for the remainder of the quarantine
period.  The owner will be charged the kennel fee established by the Franklin
County Animal Control Department.  The animal will not be released until
permission is given by the health department, and is currently up to date on
rabies vaccination.
   (c)   Stray Animals:  If the whereabouts of the animal are not known, get as
complete a description as possible.  Fill out stray animal form and give to
Administrative Secretary.  This information is mailed to the media in order to
get the information on the air.  It is the decision of the bitten party’s
physician as to the steps to be taken to ensure their safety.
   (d)   Animals on Home Quarantine:  Sanitarians will fill out quarantine form
with the yellow copy going to Animal Control, the pink copy is attached to the
animal bite card and the white copy goes to the owner of the animal.  If
personal contact is not made with the owner, the sanitarian must follow-up with
a phone call.
   (e)   At the end of confinement (ten days from the date of the bite), either
a representative of the health department or certified veterinarian must see
the animal.  Proof of rabies vaccination must be obtained prior to release from
quarantine.  Animals may not receive any vaccinations or medications during
quarantine without permission of the Health Commissioner.  Should this occur,
confinement time may be extended a minimum of thirty days.  The bitten party is
to be notified that we cannot determine if the animal is free of rabies.
   (f)   The Sanitarian will call the bitten party after the animal is released
from quarantine, and report the condition of the animal.  If the bitten party’s
physician feels post- exposure shots are indicated, the physician shall write a
prescription and call the Franklin County Board of Health’s Nursing Director. 
A purchase order is then obtained from the Franklin County Commissioners.  The
serum is obtained from the Ohio State University (paid for by the county
commissioners).  The bitten party then brings in the prescription and picks up
the serum.  This service is available to any resident of Franklin County.
   (g)   If the animal was sacrificed at the Franklin County Animal Shelter,
the head is picked up by the Sanitarian.  The Sanitarian is to sign the
Franklin County Animal Control Department records.  A lab slip is filled out
and the head is taken to the Ohio Department of Health Laboratory.  (See Head
Removal Procedure).  After the brains have been analyzed, the lab calls this
department with the results and returns the analysis form.  The animal bite
card is pulled, the results are recorded, and the bitten party is notified with
a phone call.  The date and time of the phone call is recorded on the animal
bite card.  The results are then logged into the computer.  The card is then
placed in the permanent file under the owner’s last name.  If the animal is a
stray or wild, file card under the bitten party’s name.
   (h)   Any wild, feral, or exotic animals involved in a human bite must be
sacrificed immediately, and the head submitted to the lab for analysis.
   (i)   If the animal demonstrates any clinical signs of rabies, (i.e.
limping, rejection of food or water, mood change, unexplained behavior changes,
etc.)  the animal should be sacrificed for lab analysis.  The bitten party is
given recommendations to begin post-exposure shots.  Series can be stopped if
analysis result is negative.
   (j)   If the animal is killed or dies during quarantine, the brains must be
submitted to the lab for analysis.  If the animal “disappears”, the bitten
party must be notified and advised to confer with their physician regarding
post-exposure shots.
   (k)   If the bitten party has been bitten by a bat or skunk, shots should
begin immediately if the animal cannot be checked.
(Res. 07-94.  Passed 4-21-94.)
1705.11  COMMUNICABLE DISEASE RULES RELATING TO RABIES.
   (a)   Report of Bite of Dog or Other Animal.  Whenever a person is bitten by
a dog or other animal, report of such bite shall be made within twenty-four
hours to the Health Commissioner of the district in which such bite occurred. 
The report herein required shall be made in the same manner and by the same
persons made responsible for reporting diseases listed as Class A in Rule 3701-
3-02, of the Ohio Administrative Code, or by the person bitten.
      (1)   Biting dog or cat.
         A.   Whenever it is reported to the Health Commissioner of a health
district that any dog or cat has bitten a person, that dog or cat shall be
quarantined under an order issued by the Health Commissioner of the health
district in which the bite was inflicted.  The dog or cat shall be quarantined
by its owner or by a harborer, or shall be quarantined in a pound or kennel. 
In all cases, said quarantine shall be under the supervision of the Health
Commissioner and shall be at the expense of the owner or harborer. Quarantine
shall continue until the Health Commissioner of the health district in which
the bite was inflicted determines that the dog or cat is not afflicted with
rabies.  The quarantine period hereby required shall not be less than ten days
from the date on which the person was bitten.  If any time during the
quarantine the Health Commissioner requires the dog or cat to be examined for
symptoms of rabies, then the examination shall be by a licensed doctor of
veterinary medicine.  The veterinarian shall report to the Health Commissioner
the conclusions reached as a result of the examinations.  The examination by a
veterinarian shall be released from the required quarantine unless and until it
has been properly vaccinated against rabies.
         B.   If any quarantined dog or cat dies before the quarantine period
expires, then the head of the animal shall be submitted to the Ohio Department
of Health Laboratories for rabies examination.
         C.   If the owner or harborer of the dog or cat is unknown, the Health
Commissioner may direct that the dog or cat be sacrificed, in which case the
head of the animal shall be submitted to the Ohio Department of Health
Laboratories for rabies examination.
      (2)   Other biting animals.  Whenever it is reported to the Health
Commissioner of the health district that any animal that is commonly known to
transmit rabies has bitten a person, the Health Commissioner, at his/her
discretion, may direct the immediate sacrificing of said animal by a suitable
humane method.  The head of said animal shall then be submitted to the Ohio
Department of Health Laboratories for rabies examination.
   (b)   Report of Suspected Rabid Animal.  Any veterinarian or other person
who examines, treats, owns, harbors, or otherwise cares for any animal which
exhibits symptoms or behavior suggestive of rabies, shall confine and isolate
such animal in suitable quarters  and shall report such fact within twenty-four
hours to the health commissioner of the health district wherein such animal is
confined.  Such animal shall be confined until it has been determined that it
is not affected with rabies.  If it is determined that the animal is rabid, the
health commissioner shall take such position as is necessary to prevent the
occurrence of rabies in persons known or presumed to have been exposed to such
rabid animal.
