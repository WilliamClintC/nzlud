indicated:
ELECTED OFFICIAL  Persons holding the position of Mayor or Township

C. Subject to the exception in Subsection D below, this article and the

in any way be construed to prohibit or make unlawful any current
employment relationship or situation or the hiring or promotion of any
person currently employed by the Township of North Brunswick as of
the effective date of this article which may technically be violative of
the terms hereof but for its prospective application. For purposes of
interpreting this exception, persons appointed to positions of
employment with the Township for a set term shall be considered
current employees, notwithstanding the fact that the then term may
have ended. Such persons holding positions of employment with the

personnel.
§ 3-68. Current employees.
Except as may be otherwise expressly provided for herein, this article shall
not affect the employment of any present Township employees and/or any
existing contractual obligations with employees by the Township of North

employment by the Township of North Brunswick or hired to a position
of employment with the Township where that person will be the
supervisor of or be supervised by another relative who is an existing
employee within the same department.
B. Applications. Applications for employment submitted by relatives of
Township employees holding current supervisory positions (hereinafter
"supervisor") will not be accepted for positions in the same department
of the Township in which the supervisor works or where, through
promotion, such a situation or relationship could exist.
C. Relatives of elected officials. No person who is a relative of any elected
official of the Township of North Brunswick (i.e., Mayor or Township
Council) shall be considered for employment as an employee of the
Township. This shall not restrict nor prohibit the continued employment
of individuals to a position or positions with the Township where a
relative of an employee is elected as a Mayor or Township Council after
the date of the employee's start of employment with the Township.
D. Promotion of existing employees. Notwithstanding the prospective
application as to the remainder of this article as applied above, no
elected official (Mayor or Township Council) or supervisor in a
department may participate in the promotion process or hiring process
in that department of any existing employee who is a relative of such
elected official or supervisor, as the case may be. Such elected official
or supervisor shall abstain from participation in such personnel action
as it applies to such relative.

(c) Time used must be approved in advance by the employee's

(e) Unused vacation days carry only to the end of the next
succeeding year. The Business Administrator is granted
authority to permit an exception that permits accumulated
time to be carried past the next succeeding year. However,
there shall be no payment made upon separation for accrued

hereinabove.
(f) An employee may surrender and receive payment, at their

any vacation leave used in excess of the prorated vacation
leave available.
(h) When an employee discontinues employment for any reason,
the balance of vacation leave time shall be paid at the rate of
pay the time was earned. For example: If an employee retires
December 31 and, based on years of service, is entitled to 16

(1) In a year that an employee discontinues his or her employment with
the Township, the 15 sick leave days newly allotted in that year on
January 1 shall be prorated to the portion of the year the employee
is employed. If an employee has exceeded his or her accumulated

employee's final pay shall be adjusted to recoup the value of any
sick leave used in excess of the accumulated sick leave available.

workday.
§ 61-15 OPEN SPACE COMMITTEE § 61-16
60:113
(3) Notification of time used must be provided in advance of the

between 15 and 30 days of accrued sick time, they may sell back up
to a maximum of five days that year at their current rate of pay as of
December 31.
B. Effective October 29, 2018, employees that have been appointed
permanently to a part-time position shall accrue one hour of earned sick
leave for every 30 hours worked, up to a maximum of 40 hours in a
twelve-month period.

waiting period, by the total number of calendar days worked by the
employee prior to the separation.

Colonial Life).
H. Health and prescription waiver.
(1) The Township offers a conditional opt-out, where employees may
elect to waive their health and prescription benefit coverage, but
§ 61-24 OPEN SPACE COMMITTEE § 61-24
60:119

year of a waiver, he or she shall only qualify for a prorated share of
the waived benefit.

absence; the employee may elect to extend coverage, for a
maximum of nine months, by making arrangements for prepayment
of contributions due, including rate changes. Continued
contribution shall be based on an employee's pre-leave salary. It
shall be the employee's sole responsibility to make continued
§ 61-24 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 61-24

payments while on leave in accordance with previous P.L. 2011, c.
78, and guidelines under NJDPB Fact Sheet #30.

§ 61-26. Pension.
A. The Township participates in the following state-administered
retirement systems: Public Employees Retirement System (PERS),
Police and Fire Retirement System (PFRS), and the Defined
Contribution Retirement Plan (DCRP). The Township's participation,
and ability to offer an employee continued enrollment, is contingent
upon annual state certification of funding of the retirement system.
Matters such as an employee's eligibility, enrollment, benefit plan,
required contribution, status, loan application, service credit time,
transfers, withdrawal and type of retirement are all regulated by the
New Jersey Department of Pensions and Benefits (NJDPB). No
exceptions can be made by the Township as the employer.
B. Employees enrolled in a pension plan will be issued a Pension Member
ID by the NJDPB, which will be maintained on file in the Municipal
Finance Department. An employee can access their pension account
online by registering through the State Member Benefits Online System
(MBOS). Signing up for the MBOS will require the Pension Member ID
and the employee's social security number. https://www.state.nj.us/
treasury/pensions/documents/pdf/mbos-flier.pdf
C. The Member Benefits Online System (MBOS) gives registered users
internet access to their pension and health benefit account information
and online applications. Some options include:

(2) Designating a beneficiary.
(3) Getting a pension loan.
(4) Applying for withdrawal.
(5) Applying for retirement.
(6) Retrieving letters and statements.
D. As the employer, the Township is responsible to make both the required
employer and employee monthly contributions for active employees
receiving compensation via a payroll transaction issued by the
Township.
E. Leave of absence without pay.
(1) Employees that are members of the PERS and PFRS are eligible to
purchase service credit for each official leave of absence without
pay which service time was suspended.
§ 61-26 OPEN SPACE COMMITTEE § 61-26
60:127
(2) The amount of service credit eligible for purchase shall depend on
the type of leave that is taken.
(3) Conditions that pertain to the purchase of service credit for eligible
leaves of absence shall be in accordance with rules promulgated by
the NJDPB (outlined on Fact Sheet #20 as of February 2019).
(4) For the time an employee fails to make a contribution, the
Township shall not make an employer contribution, and no service
credit time will be accrued on the employee's account.
(5) Employees that are members of the DCRP are not eligible to
purchase any portion of service credit for an official leave of
absence without pay.
F. Pension loan.
(1) Employees that are members of the PERS and PFRS are eligible to
borrow funds against their pension account.
(2) Eligibility and loan terms shall be in accordance with the rules
promulgated by the NJDPB (outlined on Fact Sheet #81 as of
February 2019).
(3) When the employee has a pension loan, the Township shall make
the employee's monthly repayments, based on the certified amount
provided by the NJDPB, for active employees receiving
compensation via a payroll transaction issued by the Township.
(4) If on an approved unpaid leave of absence, the employee must
make regular periodic payments to repay the outstanding loan. If
there is a failure to make required loan repayments for three
consecutive months, when taking a leave of absence without pay,
the NJDBP will issue a letter providing options to pay the
outstanding balance and the process followed for failure to pay. The
Township has no authority to intervene and shall not be liable for
any consequences when an employee on leave fails to make a
payment.
G. Account management. When enrolled in a pension plan, it is an
employee's sole responsibility (active, separated or retired) to manage
their account. This includes making application for pension loans,
verifying status and account accuracy, purchase of service credit,
designating or changing beneficiary information, making application
for a withdrawal or transfer, and making application for retirement.

1939, c. 86). Personnel properly enrolled, trained and certified
according to the orders, rules and regulations of N.J.S.A. App. A:9-45 as
auxiliary police shall have the powers of regular police officers during a
designated emergency or properly assigned training mission only. All
assignments of auxiliary police will be approved by the Chief of Police of
the municipality or authority having this responsibility during an
emergency or disaster or training mission.
B. General operational assignments listed are the municipality's option for
use of CD-DC auxiliary police:
(1) Vehicular and pedestrian traffic control.
(2) Receiving and disseminating warnings.
(3) Disseminating information and instructions to the public as
directed.
(4) Security of governmental buildings within the municipality, federal,
state, county or local, as directed.
(5) Security of essential industries, power sources and
communications.
(6) Assisting in staffing and operating the emergency operating center.

65:138
§ 69-6. Summary of intent.
§ 69-7. Minimum work detail; uniform; Commanding Officer.
(7) Enforcement of law and order as required and/or directed.
(8) Documentation of all tasks initiated or completed and unusual
incidents encountered during assigned duty.
C. Firearms use.
(1) Firearms assignments to auxiliary police will be made at the
discretion of the local Chief of Police.
(2) Assignments may be made under the following conditions:
(a) Personnel shall be properly trained and qualified by a
competent and sanctioned regular police firearms instructor
certified by the New Jersey Police Training Commission.
(b) Auxiliary police shall have been properly investigated by
proper authorities with reference to character, medical record
and psychological background.
(c) Auxiliary police must be properly covered by insurance by the
municipality authorizing the use of firearms.
A. Auxiliary police are deemed a necessity to a well-organized Civil
Defense - Disaster Control operation in any municipality. Their
qualifications should meet a minimum standard to enable them to
perform their assignments in a proper manner. The service they
perform is a reflection upon the municipality they serve and the Civil
Defense - Disaster Control Division of the State of New Jersey. Proper
selection and training of auxiliary police is essential for an efficient
operational agency to supplement the regular police force in the event
of any local, state or national emergency.
B. Civil defense police services are built on existing law enforcement
organizations. Through years of law enforcement, America's Police
Departments have developed and used methods and procedures for
handling emergencies of all types. Police problems encountered in civil
defense are closely related to those of peacetime operations but are
multiplied under emergency conditions in direct proportion to the
extent of the emergency. The many police agencies in New Jersey which
participate in law enforcement programs must be ready to mobilize for
civil defense emergencies and to work together as one functioning
organization. To this end, the civil defense policies, administration,
operation and training of police services should be uniform.
A. Auxiliary officers must work a minimum of one four-hour detail every 14
days (104 hours yearly).
§ 69-5 PLANNING DIRECTOR § 69-7
65:139
B. There not being a specific auxiliary police uniform, North Brunswick
auxiliary police officers will wear the existing reserve police uniform as
determined by the Chief of Police.
C. North Brunswick auxiliary police officers will wear a shoulder patch
indicating their designation as reserve or special police determined by
each officer's level of training and his qualifications.
D. The Chief of Police will appoint a Commanding Officer to be in charge of
all auxiliary reserve/special officers, and to act as his representative in
auxiliary police matters.

70:162
§ 70-2. Contributions made prior to the effective date.
No contribution of money or any other thing of value, including in-kind
contributions, made by a professional business entity to any Township of
North Brunswick candidate for Mayor or Township Council or Township of
North Brunswick party committee or PAC referenced in this article shall be
deemed a violation of this article, nor shall an agreement be disqualified

contract requires approval or appropriation from the Township
Council.

provision of services, and shall be in addition to any other certifications
that may be required by any other provision of law.

70:163
Township candidate or officeholder, Township political party or PAC
referenced in this article.
§ 70-5. Limitation on employee contributions.
To the extent that it is not inconsistent with state or federal law, no
Township employee shall knowingly solicit or make any contribution of
money, pledge of contribution, including in-kind contributions, to any
Township candidate or holder of public office or to any Township party
committee or to any PAC that is organized for the purpose of promoting
or supporting Township municipal candidates or municipal officeholders in

Brunswick Zoning Board of Adjustment or Planning Board, as the case
may be, a disclosure setting forth the amounts of all contributions to any
Township candidate or holder of public office or to any Township party
committee or to any PAC referenced in this article, made by such applicant
within two calendar years of the date of such application.
§ 70-7. Retroactivity of future clarifications adopted.
A. It is anticipated that there may be some professional business entities
which determine to attempt a legalistic adherence to the letter, rather
than the spirit, of this article. It is the declared intent of this municipal
governing body to remain vigilant to recognize such attempts to subvert
the underlying purposes for which this article was adopted. Any
professional business entity which may attempt such creative
subversion does so at its peril. If and in the event creative actions are
taken in order to defeat the purposes of this article, it is the intention of
the governing body to enact appropriate clarification of this article,
which clarification shall be retroactive to the initial effective date of this
article, thereby disqualifying such creative professional business
entities from serving the Township. Changes to this article which are
not for purposes of clarification, but which are amendments to the
provisions hereto, shall become effective upon adoption and publication
according to law.
B. It is the express legislative intent of the governing body of the Township
of North Brunswick to avoid the perception of any improper influence
on local elections. Therefore, to the extent that any portion of provision
of the Ordinance is adjudged by the courts to be invalid, it is the express
hope and desire of the governing body that any professional business
entities seeking public contracts with the Township will voluntarily
comply with this express legislative intent.
§ 70-4 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 70-8
70:164
§ 70-8. Violations and penalties.
A. All Township of North Brunswick professional service agreements shall
provide that it shall be a breach of the terms of the government
contract for a professional business entity to violate § 70-1B or to
knowingly conceal or misrepresent contributions given or received or
to make or solicit contributions through intermediaries for the purpose
of concealing or misrepresenting the source of the contribution.
B. Any professional business entity as defined in § 70-1C and D who
knowingly fails to reveal a contribution made in violation of this article,
or who knowingly makes or solicits contributions through
intermediaries for the purpose of concealing or misrepresenting the
source of the contribution, shall be disqualified from eligibility for
future Township of North Brunswick contracts, agreements or provision
of goods and services for a period of four calendar years from the date
of the violation.

continued occupancy, provided that there are no violations of law
or orders of the Construction Official, in consultation with the
Zoning Officer, and it is established after site inspection and
investigation of available municipal records that the alleged use of
the building or structure has lawfully existed. The certificate shall
evidence only that a general inspection of the visible parts of the
building or structure has been made and that no violations of
N.J.A.C. 5:23-2.14, as amended (Construction Permits When
Required), and N.J.A.C. 5:23-2.18, as amended (Inspections), have

and a general inspection of visible parts of the structure, finds any
violation as set forth in Subsection B(4), he shall notify the owner of
the violation, in writing, by mail, or by delivering the notice to the
owner or his agent. The notice shall identify the premises and
specify the violations and any remedial action, along with
compliance date. The notice will require the owner to satisfy the
violations, file any necessary permits as required, and state that
failure to correct the violations within the time specified shall
result in fines as prescribed in the Uniform Construction Code.
(6) A certificate of continued occupancy shall be effective for a period
of 120 days. One administrative extension of not more than 30 days
may be granted by the Construction Official. If a dwelling fails to
sell, transfer or grant with right of occupancy within this period,
and the dwelling remains for sale, the owner shall make written
application and obtain a new CCO.
(7) If the application for a certificate states that the dwelling unit is not
intended for residential occupancy or human habitation, the
Construction Official may waive the requirement for a certificate of
continued occupancy.

ARTICLE I
Authorization; Findings; Purpose
§ 180-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has, in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et
seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry. Therefore, the Mayor and Council of the Township of North
Brunswick, Middlesex County, New Jersey does ordain as follows:
§ 180-2. Findings of fact.
The flood hazard areas of Township of North Brunswick are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative
effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood
heights and velocities, and, when inadequately anchored, cause damage in
other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
§ 180-3. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
§ 180-1 EXHIBITIONS, SHOWS, THEATRICAL PLACES § 180-4
168:291
§ 180-4. Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
floodwaters;
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and

first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site such as
the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction
of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement
of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings or piers, or foundations or the erection
of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property
of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling
units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the
actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling,
floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the building.

B. Conditions for variances.
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the
items in § 180-15A(4)(a) through (k) have been fully considered. As
the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as an historic structure and the variance is the
minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design
of the structure.
(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public as identified in § 180-15A(4) or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

A. Anchoring.
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the
structure.
(2) All manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist flotation,
collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include,
but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to
ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state
and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
B. Construction materials and methods.
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood
damage.
(2) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood

improvements having fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that
are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in
an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall
be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs
for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria: A minimum of two openings having a total net area of
not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall
be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped

168:304
§ 180-18. Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in § 180-7 are areas
designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area
due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles,
and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
including basement together with the attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities, either:
(1) Elevated to the level of the base flood elevation; and within any AO
Zone on the municipality's DFIRM, require that all new
construction and substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial or other nonresidential structure shall have the lowest
floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent
grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet (at least

A. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development unless a technical evaluation
demonstrates that encroachment shall not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
B. If Subsection A above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements must comply with Article V.
C. In all areas of special flood hazard in which base flood elevation data
have been provided and no floodway has been designated, the
§ 180-17 EXHIBITIONS, SHOWS, THEATRICAL PLACES § 180-18
168:305
cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with
all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the

Chapter 182
FUND-RAISING, POLITICAL
GENERAL REFERENCES
Ethics, Code of  See Ch. 29.
§ 182-1. Short title.
An ordinance banning the use of government buildings and government
equipment for political fund-raising.
§ 182-2. Purpose.
Whereas, political contributions have a profound impact on government
decision making; and whereas, our laws in New Jersey do not presently
ban solicitation or acceptance of contributions by public office holders
and employees while on public property or by use of public facilities; and
whereas, a conflict may arise between the business of political fund-raising
and the business of government in town hall and other government-owned
premises, and this may cause a distraction from the people's business,
and whereas, the most appropriate method to prevent this conflict and to
ensure the integrity of government decisions is the prohibition of political
fund-raising on or by use of public property; therefore, it is accordingly
found and determined that the paramount public interest in a clean and
accountable government requires the prohibition of political fund-raising on
public property or use of public facilities.
§ 182-3. Definitions.
As used in this chapter the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
CANDIDATE  Any individual seeking election to a public office of the
federal government, state, county, municipality, school district or political
organization at an election.
CONTRIBUTION  Includes all loans and transfers of money or other thing
of value to or by a candidate, elected official or political organization and all
pledges or other commitments or assumptions of liability to make any such
transfer. Contributions shall be deemed to have been made upon the date
when such commitment is made or liability assumed.
MUNICIPAL OFFICIAL, EMPLOYEE and APPOINTEE  Any person holding
elective municipal office or holding an appointed position in the municipal
government or in any agency, commission, board or office thereof, whether
the position is full-time or part-time, compensated or uncompensated, and
any employee of municipal government or in any agency, commission, board
or office thereof, whether the position is full-time or part-time.

H. Establish selection procedures and criteria for determining qualified
purchasers and households. Preference shall be given for up to 40% of
the lower-income units being offered for sale or rent in each phase of a
project to qualified households who live or work in the Township. In
order to be entitled to said preference, the application must be
submitted within 30 days of the unit initially being offered for sale or
rent. In the class "live or work," there shall be no preference given to
either "live" or "work."

§ 195-7 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 195-7
194:334
I. Verify that an affordable housing plan has been recorded and the deeds
of individual lower-income units reference such affordable housing
plan.
J. Develop a formula for use in calculating the maximum resale price of
low- and moderate-income units which is consistent with the provisions
of § 195-11B of this Part 1.
K. Determine whether the cost or value of the installation of improvements
or amenities within or as part of a low- or moderate-income unit should
be included in the calculation of the resale price or rental charge for the
unit and establish procedures whereby a homeowner can obtain a
determination from the Agency in this regard prior to the time the
improvements are made. The Agency shall publish within 30 days of
adoption the guidelines and regulations setting forth the allowable
capital improvements that will be considered for inclusion in the resale
price of any lower-income unit. These regulations will indicate those
improvements whose value will be included; the maximum cost allowed
to be included within the resale price for each improvement, as well as
guidelines for the total maximum percentage by which the base price of
a lower-income unit may be increased by the cost of all capital
improvements and the rate at which such maximum percentage
increase may be attained, all for the purposes of determining the
maximum resale price of the lower-income units. No portion of the cost
or value of any improvement not specifically set forth in the guidelines
and regulations and which is not approved by the Agency prior to
installation shall be included within the base price for purposes of
resale price calculation. If the owner receiving approval from the
Agency for an improvement, a portion of the cost or value of which is to
be included within the base price of the lower-income unit, is in need of
a second mortgage in order to pay for such improvement, then the
Agency shall execute and deliver to the owner for recording by the
owner a document by which the Agency's rights, claims and liens under
this Affordable Housing Ordinance and the affordable housing plan are
also subordinated to such second mortgage. The Agency's rights, claims
and liens shall not be subordinated to any second mortgages unless the
Agency shall execute and deliver such instrument to an owner in
connection with an improvement approved by the Agency.
L. Review and approve or disapprove the affordable housing plan required
of all developers of low- and moderate-income housing.
M. Review and approve or disapprove the developer's proposed affirmative
marketing plan and require developers to submit proofs of publication
in accordance with approved affirmative marketing plans, and monitor
the marketing practices of developers of low- and moderate-income
units to ensure that they comply with the affirmative marketing
requirements of this Part 1.
N. Report quarterly to the Township Council on the status of low- and
moderate-income units, including but not limited to such things as the
§ 195-7 HOTEL AND MOTEL ROOM OCCUPANCY TAX § 195-7
194:335
§ 195-8. Appropriation and accountability.
Agency's actions in connection with any statements of exemption and
foreclosures upon any lower-income units.
O. At all times, maintain a waiting list of qualified purchasers and provide
said list to any owner in the event of default proceedings.
A. Developers of lower-income units shall, at the time of submission of an
application to the Township Planning Board, reimburse the Township on
a pro-rata basis for the cost of all initial start-up costs. Start-up costs
are those costs necessary to enable the Agency to establish rules,
regulations and guidelines and shall include, but not be limited to,
attorney's fees, accountant's fees and fees for other required
professional services. The total obligation for start-up costs to all
developers shall be $15,000. The pro-rata calculation shall be
performed by the Agency utilizing the Township's total lower-income
obligation established by pursuant court order.
B. The Agency may employ or contract for professional services required
to carry out its duties and responsibilities, and all developers of lowerincome
units shall be required to pay application fees at the time of
submission for site plan approval. Said fee shall be equal to $10 per
lower-income unit included in the application for site plan approval.
C. The Agency shall report to the Township Council through the Township
Administrator.

ARTICLE III
General Provisions
§ 195-9. Sale/rent of units; low- or moderate-income households.
A. Wherever reference is made to low- or moderate-income housing in the
Township's Zoning Ordinance,72 the standards, definitions and
procedures set forth in this Part 1 shall apply.
B. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no low-income unit shall
be offered for sale or rental except at prices that are affordable by lowincome
households and no moderate-income unit shall be offered for
sale or rental except at prices that are affordable by moderate-income
households and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no lowincome
unit shall be sold, resold, rented or rerented except to a
household that has been qualified as a low-income household by the
Agency, and no moderate-income unit shall be sold, resold, rented or
rerented except to a household that has been qualified as a moderateincome
household by the Agency. The provisions of this subsection shall
apply equally to qualified lower-income owners or renters, in terms of
controls on sale, resale, rental or rerental of any lower-income unit.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this part to the contrary, a
certified household that purchases a restricted ownership unit must
occupy it as the principal residence and not lease the unit; provided,
however, the Agency may permit the owner of the restricted unit, upon
a showing of hardship, to lease the unit to a certified household for a
period not to exceed one year. [Amended 12-20-2004 by Ord. No.
04-35]
C. Nothing contained in this Part 1, however, or in the rules and
regulations promulgated by the Agency, shall restrict or preclude any
household which was classified as low- or moderate-income based upon
its gross aggregate household income at the time it purchased or leased
a low- or moderate-income unit from continuing to own or lease said
unit after its income exceeds the income ceilings established in this Part
1.
D. Prospective purchasers of lower-income units shall receive prior to or
simultaneously with the execution of the contract to purchase a lowerincome
unit a copy of the affordable housing plan and shall execute a
disclosure statement which briefly summarizes the salient features of
the use, occupancy and resale restrictions applicable to the lowerincome
unit. It shall be the developer's responsibility to provide such
for the initial sales and the subsequent owner's responsibility to provide
the same for resales. The developer shall record the affordable housing
plan prior to conveying any title to any individual lower-income unit or
executing a lease for any individual lower-income unit and the deeds or
leases or individual lower-income units must reference such recorded
affordable housing plan.

§ 195-9 HOTEL AND MOTEL ROOM OCCUPANCY TAX § 195-9
194:337
§ 195-10. Income eligibility.
§ 195-11. Sales price and rental charges.
Prior to the sale, resale, rental or rerental of a low- or moderate-income
unit, the Agency shall determine the maximum sales price or rental charge
that may be charged for that size unit in each income category in
accordance with the following:
E. The Township of North Brunswick shall forever receive full credit
towards its then current total fair share obligation as may be
determined from time to time so long as the then-current total fair
share obligation includes previous fair share obligations for all lowerincome
units developed pursuant to this Affordable Housing Ordinance,
so long as such lower-income units are actually sold, resold, used,
occupied, rented, rerented and maintained in full and complete
compliance with the provisions of this Part 1, including but not limited
to those provisions covering hardship, foreclosure and exempt
transactions and the affordable housing plan.
F. The initial proportional relationship between condominium fees
assessed against market units and lower-income units shall not be
increased in future years and said restrictions shall be reflected in the
articles of incorporation and in the required disclosure statement.
Association fees assessed against said lower-income units shall be no
less than 1/3 of the fee which would have been assessed had all
condominiums (both lower-income and market units) been assessed
equally. Such initial calculations shall be provided by the developer.
A. A prospective purchaser or renter of a low- or moderate-income unit
must be qualified as a low- or moderate-income household by the
Agency prior to the purchase or rental of such unit. The Agency shall
periodically recalculate the regional median income and determine
adjustments for household size as updated data or estimates of regional
median income become available.
B. The income ceilings for low- and moderate-income households of four
members shall be 50% and 80%, respectively, of the regional median
income, with adjustments for household size in accordance with
guidelines of the United States Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
A. Estimated maximum initial sales prices for units.
(1) As part of the preliminary site plan application submittal to the
Planning Board by a developer for a development containing lowerincome
units, the developer shall also submit to the Agency
information demonstrating the mortgage financing generally
available to lower-income homebuyers and the developer's
calculations as to the estimated maximum sales prices in
accordance with Subsection B below.
§ 195-9 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 195-11
194:338
(2) The Agency shall review the developer's calculations and shall
determine the estimated maximum sales prices for applicable-sized
units in each income category in accordance with the financial
terms determined to be generally available and shall notify the
Planning Board and the developer of said estimated maximum sales
prices prior to final approval by the Planning Board. The delay of
the Agency shall not postpone or delay the Planning Board's
decision as to the proposed development.
B. Actual maximum initial sales prices for units.
(1) A base sales price shall be calculated such that the sum of the
monthly payments for principal, interest, taxes, fire, theft and
liability insurance and homeowner association fees, if any, shall not
exceed 28% of the low- or moderate-income ceilings determined in
accordance with § 195-10.
(2) In order to assure that low- and moderate-income units are
affordable by households whose income is less than the low- or
moderate-income ceilings, the maximum sales price that may be
offered for each such unit shall not exceed 90% of the base price for
that size unit in each income category.
(3) At least a minimum of 30 days prior to the developer's anticipated
need of building permits, with the exception of permits for model
units, the developer shall provide the Agency with information
demonstrating the financing that is generally available locally to
lower-income homebuyers and the developer's calculations as to
maximum initial sales prices. The interest rate used by the
developer in calculating the maximum sales price shall be the rate
that the Agency determines to be generally available locally for a
ninety-percent, thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgage.
(4) If the developer proposes to provide financing through an
adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) or establishes that ARM's are
generally available locally to lower-income purchasers, then the
interest rate to be used for calculating the maximum sales price
shall be the greater of either the current index of one-year Treasury
Bills plus two points or two points less than the best available fixed
rate mortgage.
(5) The Agency shall use this information to determine the maximum
initial sales prices for the different-sized units in each income
category, as described above. The Agency shall certify the actual
maximum initial sales prices to the Planning Board, the developer
and the Construction Official in charge of issuing building permits
within 30 days of submission of complete information by the
developer. No building permits, except for complete models,
including models of non-lower-income units, foundation permits for
units other than models, permits for underground utilities and site
development work shall be issued until the maximum initial sales
§ 195-11 HOTEL AND MOTEL ROOM OCCUPANCY TAX § 195-11
194:339
prices have been certified by the Agency. These sales prices shall
remain in effect for a period of one year. However, the developer
may request a modification of the maximum sales prices at any time
by applying to the Affordable Housing Agency for recalculation
of these prices based on changes in any of the factors used to
calculate the prices.
C. Maximum resale prices. [Amended 5-21-2007 by Ord. No. 07-10]
(1) Prior to the resale of any low- or moderate-income unit, the Agency
shall determine the maximum sales price for the unit. The price of
low- and moderate-income units may be increased annually based
upon the percentage increase in the housing consumer price index
for the United States. This increase shall not exceed 9% in any one
year. The Agency is hereby authorized to use the COAH/HAS Sale
Price Calculator, as authorized and established by the New Jersey
Department of Community Affairs, Council on Affordable Housing,
in determining the maximum resale price for any given affordable
housing unit.
(2) Low- or moderate-income affordable housing units.
(a) The maximum resale price for low- or moderate-income
affordable housing units which have been designated as such
as of the effective date of this subsection shall be set pursuant
to the maximum resale prices established as of December 31,
2005, as follows:
Unit Size/Low-Moderate Maximum Resale Price
Two-bedroom low-income unit $110,238
Three-bedroom low-income unit $130,494
Two-bedroom moderate-income
unit
$130,746
Three-bedroom moderateincome
unit
$157,930
(b) These prices shall be used for purposes of determining the
resale price using the COAH/HAS Sale Price Calculator.
(3) Any low- or moderate-income affordable housing units constructed
and sold after the effective date of this subsection shall have resale
prices set and determined by using the COAH/HAS Sale Price
Calculator, based upon the actual sales prices and dates of sale.
D. Maximum rental charges for units.
(1) A base rent shall be calculated such that the sum of the monthly
rental payment, including utilities, does not exceed 30% of the lowor
moderate-income ceilings determined in accordance with
§ 195-10.
§ 195-11 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 195-11
194:340
(2) If the cost of all utilities is not included in the monthly rental
charge, the Agency shall calculate for each unit size an estimated
monthly charge for those utilities not included in the rent. These
charges shall be estimated utilizing estimating techniques
acceptable in the industry. This estimated charge shall be
subtracted from the maximum gross rent to determine the
maximum rental charge that may be charged for each low- and
moderate-income unit.
(3) In order to assure that low- and moderate-income units are
affordable by households whose income is less than the low- or
moderate-income ceilings, the maximum gross rent that may be
charged for any such unit shall not exceed 90% of the base rent for
that size unit in each income category. Notwithstanding these
requirements, landlords shall have the option to set rents equal to
30% of the tenant's gross household income, with the requirement
that the average of all rents charged for the same-size unit shall not
exceed 90% of the base rent charge for such size unit. The cost of
any additional administrative charges incurred by the Agency in
the monitoring of such rental distribution shall be the sole
responsibility of such landlord.
(4) The developer shall calculate the maximum rental charge for
applicable-sized units in each income category and shall submit
said calculations to the Agency for review. The Agency shall
determine, based upon its review, maximum rental charges. These
rental charges shall remain in effect for a period of at least one
year, except that the developer may request a modification of these
charges by applying to the Agency for recalculation of the prices
based on changes in any of the factors used to calculate the rental
charges.
(5) To the extent feasible, these criteria and procedures should ensure
that the new rental charges are consistent with the affordability
standards set forth in this Part 1.
(6) The Agency shall establish appropriate criteria and procedures for
allowing periodic rental charge increases.
E. Relationship between household size and unit size.
(1) For the purpose of determining maximum sales prices and rental
charges pursuant to this Part 1, the ceiling incomes of the following
household sizes shall be used to determine the maximum prices for
each of the following unit sizes:
Bedroom
Occupancy
(persons)
Efficiency 1
1 2
§ 195-11 HOTEL AND MOTEL ROOM OCCUPANCY TAX § 195-11

§ 195-13. Exempt transactions; hardship exemptions; foreclosure.
Bedroom
Occupancy
(persons)
2 3
3 5
4 6
(2) Any room other than a bathroom, kitchen, dining area or living
room and which was initially designed for regular sleeping by
regular members of the household shall be considered a bedroom
for purposes of calculating the maximum initial sales prices. No
alterations or improvements by owners after initial occupancy shall
increase the number of bedrooms unless the total area of habitable
living space is increased by an amount at least equal to the new
area being claimed as a new bedroom.
A. Restrictions governing the lower-income units offered initially for sale
shall expire as to a particular lower-income unit 30 years from the date
of recording of the initial deed of the particular lower-income unit to a
qualified purchaser.
B. The restrictions governing the rental of lower-income units shall expire
as to a particular lower-income unit 30 years from the date of the initial
certificate of occupancy of such lower-income unit and a document shall
be recorded stating such date immediately after such initial certificate
of occupancy is issued by the Township.
C. If rental units are converted within 30 years of initial occupancy, the
same number of low- and moderate-income units, respectively, must be
maintained after conversion, subject to resale controls ensuring their
continued affordability and occupancy for the balance of the thirty-year
period.
A. Exempt transactions.
(1) The following transactions shall be deemed "non-sales" for
purposes of this Part 1 and the affordable housing plan, and the
Agency shall issue a statement of exemption to the owner receiving
title by virtue of any of the following transactions:
(a) Transfer of ownership of a lower-income unit between husband
and wife.
(b) Transfer of ownership of a lower-income unit between former
spouses ordered as a result of a judicial decree of divorce or
judicial decree of separation, but not including sales to third
parties.
§ 195-11 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 195-13
194:342
(c) Transfer of ownership of a lower-income unit between family
members as a result of inheritance.
(d) Transfer of ownership of a lower-income unit through an
executor's deed to any person.
(e) Transfer of ownership of a lower-income unit through an order
of the Superior Court or other court.
(2) Such transfer of ownership neither extinguishes the restrictions
and applicability of this Part 1 or the affordable housing plan to
such lower-income unit nor terminates any liens set forth under
this plan. Liens must be satisfied in full prior to the subsequent
resale of the lower-income unit and all such subsequent resales are
fully subject to the terms and provisions of this Part 1 and the
affordable housing plan.
B. Hardship exemptions. The developer and subsequent owners may apply
to the Agency for a hardship exemption.
(1) Provisions applicable to initial sales or rentals.
(a) The developer may only apply to the Agency for a hardship
exemption after the later of six months after the developer has
commenced marketing the lower-income unit in accordance
with the requirements of the affirmative marketing
requirements as set forth in § 195-14, and 90 days after the
developer has received the certificate of occupancy for such
lower-income unit.
(b) In order for the developer to be entitled to a hardship
exemption from the Agency, the developer must show the
Agency that:
[1] The time periods set forth in Subsection B(1)(a) above
have lapsed;
[2] The developer has been marketing such lower-income unit
in accordance with the affirmative marketing requirement
for such time period; and
[3] No qualified purchaser is obligated under a contract to
purchase or a lease to rent, as the case may be, for such
lower-income unit.
(2) Provisions applicable to other than initial sales or rentals.
(a) Owners or the developers may only apply to the Agency for a
hardship exemption after 120 days after such owner or
developer has notified the Agency that such lower-income unit
is available for resale or rerental to qualified lower-income
households.
§ 195-13 HOTEL AND MOTEL ROOM OCCUPANCY TAX § 195-13
194:343
(b) In order for such owner or developer to be entitled to a
hardship exemption from the Agency, such owner or developer
must show the Agency that:
[1] The one hundred twenty-day time period has lapsed;
[2] The owner or developer has been affirmatively marketing
such unit in accordance with the affirmative marketing
requirement for such time period; and
[3] No qualified purchaser is obligated under a contract to
purchase or a lease to rent, as the case may be, for such
lower-income unit.
C. Procedural requirements for issuance of a statement of exemption for
both exempt transactions and hardship exemptions.
(1) The Agency must act upon an application for a statement of
exemption within 30 working days of receipt of such application.
(2) The Agency shall approve the application for a statement of
exemption if the Agency finds that the applicant has met its burden
of proof as described in Subsections B(1)(b) and B(2)(b) or
Subsection A above.
(3) If the Agency fails to approve, deny or conditionally approve an
application within such thirty-day period, such failure to act shall
be deemed to be an approval by the Agency of the application for a
statement of exemption.
(4) The Agency shall issue a written decision to the applicant
immediately after making its decision. If the application is
approved, the Agency shall immediately issue to the applicant a
statement of exemption in recordable form describing the specific
lower-income unit covered by the statement of exemption.
(5) The original of the statement of exemption shall be given to the
purchaser at the time of closing of title and shall be recorded
simultaneously with the deed, or to the tenant prior to taking
possession and occupancy, of the applicable lower-income unit.
D. Effect of statement of exemption for both hardship exemptions and
exempt transactions.
(1) A statement of exemption issued pursuant to Subsection B
(hardship) above shall authorize the owner or applicant to sell or
rent the particular lower-income unit to a household whose gross
aggregate household income is up to 50% higher than the original
relevant income ceilings applicable to such lower-income unit as
determined in accordance with § 195-10 of this Part 1.
(2) A statement of exemption issued in accordance with Subsection A
(exempt transactions) above shall permit the named grantee or
§ 195-13 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 195-13
194:344
lessee to receive title or possession of the particular lower-income
unit in the same manner as a qualified purchaser.
(3) The statement of exemption under Subsections A or B above shall
exempt only the specific sale or rental transaction for which it was
issued.
(4) The statement of exemption under Subsections A or B above shall
deem the grantee or lessee to be a qualified purchaser of such
lower-income unit for purposes of this Part 1 and the affordable
housing plan.
(5) The statement of exemption under Subsections A or B above shall
only relieve the specific transaction of the restriction of selling,
reselling or renting such lower-income unit to only qualified
purchasers. All other restrictions, requirements and provisions of
this Part 1 and the affordable housing plan shall remain in full force
and effect, including but not limited to the maximum sales prices
and rental charges which are established pursuant to § 195-11 of
this Part 1.
(6) The restrictions of resale or rental to only qualified purchasers
shall apply to subsequent resales or rentals of the particular lowerincome
unit unless a new statement of exemption is issued by the
Agency in accordance with the provisions of this Part 1.
(7) Nothing shall preclude the Agency from purchasing the specific
lower-income unit and holding, renting or conveying it to a
qualified purchaser, provided that such right is exercised prior to
the owner signing a valid contract to sell such lower-income unit
and such right is further exercised before the expiration of the
applicable fifteen-day period.
E. Foreclosure and first purchase money mortgages.
(1) Provisions for first purchase money mortgagees.
(a) The terms and restrictions of this Part 1 and the affordable
housing plan shall be subordinate only to the first purchase
money mortgage lien on any lower-income unit and in no way
shall impair the first purchase money mortgagee's ability to
exercise the contract remedies available to it in the event of
default as such remedies are set forth in the first purchase
money mortgage documents for the unit.
(b) So long as the first purchase money mortgage is not sold to the
Federal National Mortgage Association or in the secondary
mortgage market, the first purchase money mortgagee and/or
mortgage servicer shall serve written notice upon the Agency
within 10 days after the first purchase money mortgage is
three months in arrears, and within 10 calendar days of the
§ 195-13 HOTEL AND MOTEL ROOM OCCUPANCY TAX § 195-13
194:345
filing of the complaint seeking foreclosure of the first purchase
money mortgage held on a lower-income unit.
(c) The obligation of first purchase money mortgagee and/or
servicer to notify the Agency shall cease automatically and
immediately upon the sale of the first purchase money
mortgage to the Federal National Mortgage Association or in
the secondary mortgage market unless the rules and
regulations or guidelines of the Federal National Mortgage
Association are amended so as to not prohibit or exclude
placing such obligation upon the holder of the mortgagee or its
service representative, in which case an instrument duly
evidencing the same must be recorded with the Office of the
Recorder, Middlesex County, New Jersey, and the Clerk of the
Township of North Brunswick, before any such obligation shall
exist.
(d) Provided that the first purchase money mortgagee is obligated
to give the Agency the above-mentioned notices, the first
purchase money mortgagee shall also serve written notice of
any proposed foreclosure sale upon the Agency at least 30 days
prior to the first scheduled date of such sale.
(e) The first purchase money mortgage shall serve notice upon the
Agency within 30 days of the sale of the first purchase money
mortgage to the Federal National Mortgage Association or in
the secondary mortgage market.
(f) The Township of North Brunswick and/or the Agency or any
instrumentality designated by the Township shall have the
right to purchase any mortgage which is in default at any time
prior to the entry of a foreclosure judgment or within the
redemption period thereafter. Notification of a default and of
the institution of a foreclosure action and of a Sheriff's sale
shall be served in writing upon the Chairman of Agency as
aforesaid. The Township of North Brunswick shall at all times
be considered a party-in-interest and shall have the right to be
joined as a party defendant and/or shall have the right to
intervene in any foreclosure action seeking foreclosure of a
first mortgage and/or shall have the right to redeem and
acquire the owner's equity of redemption or to acquire the unit
from the owner upon such terms and conditions as may be
determined by the Agency.
(2) Effect of foreclosure. Any lower-income unit which is acquired by a
first purchase money mortgagee by deed in lieu of foreclosure or by
any purchaser at a mortgage foreclosure sale conducted by the
holder of the first purchase money mortgage, including the first
purchase money mortgagee but excepting the defaulting
mortgagor, shall be permanently released from the restrictions and
convenants of this plan, and all resale restrictions shall cease to be
§ 195-13 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 195-13
194:346
effective as to the first purchase money mortgagee and all
subsequent purchasers and mortgagees of that particular unit,
except for the defaulting mortgagor, who shall be forever subject
to the resale restrictions of this plan with respect to the unit owned
by him at the time of his default. The Agency shall execute a
document in recordable form evidencing that such lower-income
unit has been forever released from the restrictions of this Part
1 and the affordable housing plan. Execution of foreclosure sales
by any other class of creditor or mortgagees shall not result in a
release of the unit from the provisions and restrictions of this Part
1 or the affordable housing plan.
(3) Surplus funds. In the event of a foreclosure sale by the holder of the
first purchase money mortgage, the owner shall be personally
obligated to pay to the Agency any surplus funds. For purposes of
this subsection, "surplus funds" shall be the total amount paid to
the Sheriff in excess of the greater of the maximum resale price of
the unit pursuant to § 195-11C and the amount required to pay and
satisfy the first purchase money mortgage, including the costs of
foreclosure plus any second mortgages approved by the Agency in
accordance with § 195-7J of this Part 1. Surplus funds shall also
include all payments to any junior creditors out of such surplus
funds even if such were to the exclusion of the owner. The Agency
shall be given a first priority lien, second only to the first purchase
money mortgagee of a unit and any taxes or public assessments by
a duly authorized governmental body, equal to the full amount of
such surplus funds. This obligation of the owner to pay this full
amount of surplus funds to the Agency shall be deemed to be a
personal obligation of the owner of record at the time of the

B. Code Enforcement Official's investigation; notice of violation.
[Amended 12-20-2004 by Ord. No. 04-35]
(1) The Code Enforcement Official shall investigate all complaints of a
violation of this Part 1.
(2) The Code Enforcement Official shall, within 60 days of the receipt
of the complaint, or longer for good cause shown, timely report the

information upon which the Agency may rely to provide written
notice to an owner of a violation of this Part 1.
(3) The Agency, upon a review of the Code Enforcement Official's

written notice of a violation of this Part 1 and/or the affordable housing
plan to an owner of a low- or moderate-income unit and advising the
owner of the penalties for such violations, the Agency may take the
following action against the owner for any violation that remains

following penalties, at the discretion of the court:
(a) A fine of not more than $1,250 or imprisonment for a period

§ 195-17 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 195-17
194:352
(b) In the case of an owner who has resold his or her low- or

Brunswick Housing Trust Fund of the difference between the
unauthorized resale price and the maximum resale price
allowed by this Part 1.
(c) In the case of an owner who has rented his or her low- or
moderate-income unit in violation of this Part 1 and/or the
affordable housing plan, payment into the Township of North
Brunswick Housing Trust Fund of the difference between the
unauthorized rental charge and the maximum rental charge
allowed by this Part 1 for the entire term for which it is
determined that a violation existed.
(d) In the ease of an owner who has rented his or her low- or
moderate-income unit in violation of this Part 1 and/or the
affordable housing plan, payment of an innocent tenant's
reasonable relocation costs, as determined by the court.
(2) The Agency may file an action in the Superior Court seeking a
judgment which would result in the termination of the owner's
equity or other interest in the unit, in the nature of a mortgage
foreclosure. Any judgment shall be enforceable as if the same were
a judgment of default of the first purchase money mortgage and
shall constitute a lien against the low- and moderate-income unit.
(a) Such judgment shall be enforceable, at the option of the
Agency, by means of an execution sale by the Sheriff, at which
time the low and moderate-income unit of the violating owner
shall be sold at a sale price which is not less than the amount
necessary to fully satisfy and pay off any first purchase money
mortgage and prior liens and the costs of the enforcement
proceedings incurred by the Agency, including attorney's fees.
The violating owner shall have his right to possession
terminated as well as his title conveyed pursuant to the
Sheriff's sale.
(b) The proceeds of the Sheriff's sale shall first be applied to
satisfy the first purchase money mortgage lien and any prior
liens upon the low and moderate-income unit. The excess, if
any, shall be applied to reimburse the Agency for any and all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with either the
court action resulting in the judgment of violation or the
Sheriff's sale. In the event that the proceeds from the Sheriff's
sale are insufficient to reimburse the Agency in full as
aforesaid, the violating owner shall be personally responsible
for and to the extent of such deficiency, in addition to any and
all costs incurred by the Agency in connection with collecting
such deficiency. In the event that surplus remains after
satisfying all of the above, such surplus, if any, shall be placed
§ 195-17 HOTEL AND MOTEL ROOM OCCUPANCY TAX § 195-17
194:353
in escrow by the Agency for the owner and shall be held in such
escrow for a maximum period of two years or until such earlier
time as the owner shall make a claim with the Agency for such.
Failure of the owner to claim such balance within the two-year
period shall automatically result in a forfeiture of such balance
to the Agency. Any interest accrued or earned on such balance
while being held in escrow shall belong to and shall be paid to
the Agency, whether such balance shall be paid to the owner or
forfeited to the Agency.
(c) Foreclosure by the Agency due to violation of this Part 1 and/or
the affordable housing plan shall not extinguish the
restrictions of this Part 1 and the affordable housing plan as
the same apply to the low and moderate-income unit. Title shall
be conveyed to the purchaser at the Sheriff's sale, subject to
the restrictions and provisions of this Part 1 and the affordable
housing plan. The owner determined to be in violation of the
provisions of this plan and from whom title and possession
were taken by means of the Sheriff's sale shall not be entitled
to any right or redemption.
(d) If there are no bidders at the Sheriff's sale, or if insufficient
amounts are bid to satisfy the first purchase money mortgage
and any prior liens, the Agency may acquire title to the low and
moderate-income unit by satisfying the first purchase money
mortgage and any prior liens and crediting the violating owner
with an amount equal to the difference between the first
purchase money mortgage and any prior liens and costs of the
enforcement proceedings, including legal fees and the
maximum resale prior for which the low and moderate-income
unit could have been sold under the terms of this Part 1 and the
affordable housing plan. This excess shall be treated in the
same manner as the excess which would have been realized
from an actual sale as previously described.
(e) Failure of the low and moderate-income unit to be either sold
at the Sheriff's sale or acquired by the Agency shall obligate
the owner to accept an offer to purchase from any qualified
purchaser which may be referred to the owner by the Agency,
with such offer to purchase being equal to the maximum resale
price of the low and moderate unit as permitted by the terms
and provisions of this Part 1 and the affordable housing plan.
(f) The owner shall remain fully obligated, responsible and liable
for complying with the terms and restrictions of this Part 1 and
the affordable housing plan until such time as title is conveyed
from the owner.
D. Such judgment shall be enforceable at the option of the Agency by
means of an execution sale by the Sheriff, at which the lower-income
unit of the violating owner shall be sold at a sales price which is not less
§ 195-17 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 195-17
194:354
than the amount necessary to fully satisfy and pay off any first purchase
money mortgage and prior liens and the costs of the enforcement
proceedings incurred by the Agency, including attorney's fees. The
violating owner shall have his right to possession terminated as well as
his title conveyed pursuant to the Sheriff's sale.
E. The proceeds of the Sheriff's sale shall first be applied to satisfy the first
purchase money mortgage lien and any prior liens upon the lowerincome
unit. The excess, if any, shall be applied to reimburse the
Agency for any and all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
either the court action resulting in the judgment of violation or the
Sheriff's sale. In the event that the proceeds from the Sheriff's sale are
insufficient to reimburse the Agency in full as aforesaid, the violating
owner shall be personally responsible for and to the extent of such
deficiency, in addition to any and all costs incurred by the Agency in
connection with collecting such deficiency. In the event that a surplus
remains after satisfying all of the above, such surplus, if any, shall be
placed in escrow by the Agency for the owner and shall be held in such
escrow for a maximum period of two years or until such earlier time as
the owner shall make a claim with the Agency for such. Failure of the
owner to claim such balance within the two-year period shall
automatically result in a forfeiture of such balance to the Agency. Any
interest accrued or earned on such balance while being held in escrow
shall belong to and shall be paid to the Agency, whether such balance
shall be paid to the owner or forfeited to the Agency.
F. Foreclosure by the Agency due to violation of this Part 1 and the
affordable housing plan shall not extinguish the restrictions of this Part
1 and the affordable housing plan as the same apply to the lowerincome
unit. Title shall be conveyed to the purchaser at the Sheriff's
sale subject to the restrictions and provisions of this Part 1 and the
affordable housing plan. The owner determined to be in violation of the
provisions of this plan and from whom title and possession were taken
by means of the Sheriff's sale shall not be entitled to any right of
redemption.
G. If there are no bidders at the Sheriff's sale or if insufficient amounts are
bid to satisfy the first purchase money mortgage and any prior liens, the
Agency may acquire title to the lower- income unit by satisfying the first
purchase money mortgage and any prior liens and crediting the
violating owner with an amount equal to the difference between the
first purchase money mortgage and any prior liens and costs of the
enforcement proceedings, including legal fees and the maximum resale
price for which the lower-income unit could have been sold under the
terms of this Part 1 and the affordable housing plan. This excess shall
be treated in the same manner as the excess which would have been
realized from an actual sale as previously described.
H. Failure of the lower-income unit to be either sold at the Sheriff's sale or
acquired by the Agency shall obligate the owner to accept an offer to
purchase from any qualified purchaser, which may be referred to the
§ 195-17 HOTEL AND MOTEL ROOM OCCUPANCY TAX § 195-17
194:355
owner by the Agency, with such offer to purchase being equal to the
maximum sales price of the lower-income unit as permitted by the
terms and provisions of this Part 1 and the affordable housing plan.
I. The owner shall remain fully obligated, responsible and liable for
complying with the terms and restrictions of this Part 1 and the
affordable housing plan until such time as title is conveyed from the
owner.

framework of COAH's rules on development fees, codified at N.J.A.C.
5:97-8.

§ 195-30. Residential development.
A. Residential development of affordable housing obligations on site.
Every residential development that consists of five or more dwelling
units shall be required to build the applicable number of affordable
housing units on site. Payments in lieu of construction shall be
prohibited. If there is a fractional affordable unit required, the
applicant shall be required to pay a residential development fee of 1.5%
of the equalized assessed valuation for each market-priced unit which
contributed to the fractional unit.
B. Imposed fees.
(1) Within the Township of North Brunswick's zoning district(s),
residential developers, except for developers of the types of
development specifically exempted below, shall pay a fee of 1 1/2%
of the equalized assessed value for residential development
provided no increased density is permitted.
(2) When an increase in residential density pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-70d(5) (known as a "d" variance) has been permitted,
developers may be required to pay a development fee of 6% of the
equalized assessed value for each additional unit that may be
realized. However, if the zoning on a site has changed during the
§ 195-29 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 195-30
194:362
§ 195-31. Nonresidential development fees.
two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance application,
the base density for the purposes of calculating the bonus
development fee shall be the highest density permitted by right
during the two-year period preceding the filing of the variance
application.
(3) Example: If an approval allows four units to be constructed on a
site that was zoned for two units, the fees could equal 1 1/2% of the
equalized assessed value on the first two units; and the specified
higher percentage up to 6% of the equalized assessed value for the
two additional units, provided zoning on the site has not changed
during the two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance
application.
C. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for residential
development.
(1) Affordable housing developments and developments where the
developer has made a payment in lieu of on-site construction of
affordable units shall be exempt from development fees.
(2) Developments that have received preliminary or final site plan
approval prior to the adoption of a municipal development fee
ordinance shall be exempt from development fees, unless the
developer seeks a substantial change in the approval. Where a site
plan approval does not apply, a zoning and/or building permit shall
be synonymous with preliminary or final site plan approval for this
purpose. The fee percentage shall be vested on the date that the
building permit is issued.
(3) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing
structure undergoes a change to a more intense use, is demolished
and replaced, or is expanded, if the expansion is not otherwise
exempt from the development fee requirement. The development
fee shall be calculated on the increase in the equalized assessed
value of the improved structure.
(4) Residential structures that are demolished and replaced as a result
of a natural disaster, alterations or additions to single-family
homes, and improvements to single-family properties such as
finishing a basement, installing a deck or patio, installing a pool,
and similar improvements shall be exempt from paying a
development fee.
A. Imposed fees.
(1) Within all zoning districts, nonresidential developers, except for
developers of the types of development specifically exempted, shall
pay a fee equal to 2.5% of the equalized assessed value of the land
§ 195-30 HOTEL AND MOTEL ROOM OCCUPANCY TAX § 195-31
194:363
and improvements, for all new nonresidential construction on an
unimproved lot or lots.
(2) Nonresidential developers, except for developers of the types of
development specifically exempted, shall also pay a fee equal to
2.5% of the increase in equalized assessed value resulting from any
additions to existing structures to be used for nonresidential
purposes.
(3) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing
structure is demolished and replaced. The development fee of 2.5%
shall be calculated on the difference between the equalized
assessed value of the preexisting land and improvement and the
equalized assessed value of the newly improved structure, i.e., land
and improvement, at the time final certificate of occupancy is
issued. If the calculation required under this section results in a
negative number, the nonresidential development fee shall be zero.
B. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for
nonresidential development.
(1) The nonresidential portion of a mixed-use inclusionary or marketrate
development shall be subject to the two-and-a-half-percent
development fee, unless otherwise exempted below.
(2) The two-and-a-half-percent fee shall not apply to an increase in
equalized assessed value resulting from alterations, change in use
within existing footprint, reconstruction, renovations and repairs.
(3) Nonresidential developments shall be exempt from the payment of
nonresidential development fees in accordance with the
exemptions required pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46, as specified in the
Form N-RDF "State of New Jersey Non-Residential Development
Certification/Exemption Form." Any exemption claimed by a
developer shall be substantiated by that developer.
C. A developer of a nonresidential development exempted from the
nonresidential development fee pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46, shall be
subject to it at such time the basis for the exemption no longer applies,
and shall make the payment of the nonresidential development fee, in
that event, within three years after that event or after the issuance of
the final certificate of occupancy of the nonresidential development,
whichever is later.
D. If a property which was exempted from the collection of a
nonresidential development fee thereafter ceases to be exempt from
property taxation, the owner of the property shall remit the fees
required pursuant to this section within 45 days of the termination of
the property tax exemption. Unpaid nonresidential development fees
under these circumstances may be enforceable by the Township of
North Brunswick as a lien against the real property of the owner.

inspection, the municipal assessor shall confirm or modify the
previously estimated equalized assessed value of the improvements of
the development; calculate the development fee; and thereafter notify
the developer of the amount of the fee.
G. Should the Township of North Brunswick fail to determine or notify the
developer of the amount of the development fee within 10 business days
of the request for final inspection, the developer may estimate the
amount due and pay that estimated amount consistent with the dispute
process set forth in subsection b of § 37 of P.L. 2008, c. 46 (N.J.S.A.

§ 195-40 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 195-41
194:378
§ 195-41. Applicability.
§ 195-42. Exceptions to requirements.
A. The provisions of this article shall apply to all affordable housing
developments and affordable housing units that currently exist and that
are proposed to be created within the Township of North Brunswick
pursuant to the Township's most recently adopted HEFSP, with the
exception of specific projects that are exempted from requirements
identified herein in § 195-42.
B. In addition, any property in the Township of North Brunswick that is
currently zoned for nonresidential uses and that is subsequently
rezoned for residential purposes or receives a zoning change or a use
variance to permit residential development, or receives a zoning
change or a density variance to permit higher density residential
development, and provided such residential development provides a
sufficient compensatory benefit in terms of the density of development
permitted, shall provide an affordable housing set-aside of 15% if the
affordable units will be for rent and 20% if the affordable units will be
for sale. The determination of a "sufficient compensatory benefit" shall
be made by the reviewing authority based upon prevailing legislation
and/or case law.
C. The following sections shall apply to all developments that contain lowand
moderate-income housing units, including any currently
unanticipated future developments that will provide low- and moderateincome
housing units, subject to the exceptions outlined in § 195-42.
A. The Uniform Housing Affordability Controls (UHAC), originally adopted
October 1, 2001, and amended December 20, 2004, were designed to
implement the New Jersey Fair Housing Act (N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 et
seq.) to assure that low- and moderate-income units created under the
Act are occupied by low- and moderate-income households for an
appropriate period of time. While UHAC applies to the vast majority of
restricted units, N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.1 states that UHAC does not apply to
units qualifying for federal low-income housing tax credits.
B. The exception noted above results in both the North Brunswick Senior
Apartments building and the North Brunswick Crescent project being
exempt from UHAC requirements, as federal low-income housing tax
credits are utilized in the financing of these projects. As a result, these
two projects are exempt from the UHAC regulations, and are only
required to meet regulations in the NBAMP that are identical to UHAC
regulations if the NBAMP specifically states that a particular regulation
applies to these two developments.
C. There is one additional project in the Township that will be governed by
different affirmative marketing regulations than those proposed herein.
There are 200 affordable units located in the Governor's Pointe I and
Governor's Pointe II condominium complexes. The North Brunswick

§ 195-43. Alternative living arrangements.
§ 195-44. Phasing schedule for inclusionary zoning.
With the exception of the specific developments identified in the Township's
settlement agreement and HEFSP adopted on June 23, 2016, inclusionary
developments shall comply with the following schedule for production of
affordable units:
Maximum Percentage of Market-
Rate Units Completed
Minimum Percentage of Lowand
Moderate-Income Units
Completed
25% 0%
25% + 1% 10%
Council created the North Brunswick Affordable Housing Agency to
enforce the affordability controls for these units in 1987. The
affordability controls on these units expire in either 2018 or 2019,
depending upon the date of initial occupancy. Since 1988, the North
Brunswick Affordable Housing Agency has been regulating the sale
and resale of these units, and the income eligibility determinations of
applicants. With only two years or less remaining in the control period
of these units, these units will continue to be regulated by the North
Brunswick Affordable Housing Agency in accordance with Chapter 195,
§§ 195-1 through 195-39. Affordable units incorporated in the June
23, 2016, Housing Element and Fair Share Plan shall be regulated in
accordance with Chapter 195, §§ 195-40 through 195-60.
A. The administration of an alternative living arrangement shall be in
compliance with N.J.A.C. 5:93-5.8 and UHAC, with the following
exceptions:
(1) Affirmative marketing (N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.15), provided, however,
that the units or bedrooms may be affirmatively marketed by the
provider in accordance with an alternative plan approved by the
court;
(2) Affordability average and bedroom distribution (N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.3).
B. With the exception of units established with capital funding through a
twenty-year operating contract with the Department of Human
Services, Division of Developmental Disabilities, alternative living
arrangements shall have at least thirty-year controls on affordability in
accordance with UHAC, unless an alternative commitment is approved
by the court.
C. The service provider for the alternative living arrangement shall act as
the administrative agent for the purposes of administering the
affirmative marketing and affordability requirements for the alternative
living arrangement.

A. For all future affordable housing units that are not specifically identified
in the Township's Settlement Agreement and Township's second round
HEFSP, approved by COAH on October 1, 2003, or the third round
HEFSP, approved by the Planning Board on June 23, 2016, the following
low/moderate split and bedroom distribution of affordable housing units
shall apply:
(1) The fair share obligation shall be divided equally between low- and
moderate-income units, except that where there is an odd number
of affordable housing units, the extra unit shall be a low-income
unit. At least 10% of all restricted rental units shall be very-lowincome
units (affordable to a household earning 30% or less of
median income). The very-low-income units shall be counted as
part of the required number of low-income units within the
development.
(2) In each affordable development, at least 50% of the restricted units
within each bedroom distribution shall be low-income units.
(3) Affordable developments that are not age-restricted shall be
structured in conjunction with realistic market demands such that:
(a) The combined number of efficiency and one-bedroom units
shall be no greater than 20% of the total low- and moderateincome
units;
(b) At least 30% of all low- and moderate-income units shall be
two-bedroom units;
(c) At least 20% of all low- and moderate-income units shall be
three-bedroom units; and
(d) The remaining units may be allocated among two- and threebedroom
units at the discretion of the developer.
(4) Affordable developments that are age-restricted shall be structured
such that the number of bedrooms shall equal the number of agerestricted
low- and moderate-income units within the inclusionary
development. This standard may be met by having all one-bedroom
units or by having a two-bedroom unit for each efficiency unit.

194:381
B. Accessibility requirements. The first floor of all restricted townhouse
dwelling units and all restricted units in all other multistory buildings

through (d) can be satisfied, then an interior accessible route
of travel must be provided between stories within an individual
unit, but if all of the terms of Subsection B(1)(a) through (d)
above have been satisfied, then an interior accessible route of
travel shall not be required between stories within an
individual unit; and
(f) An accessible entranceway as set forth at P.L. 2005, c. 350
(N.J.S.A. 52:27D-311a et seq.) and the Barrier Free SubCode,
N.J.A.C. 5:23-7, or evidence that North Brunswick has collected
funds from the developer sufficient to make 10% of the
adaptable entrances in the development accessible:
[1] Where a unit has been constructed with an adaptable
entrance, upon the request of a disabled person who is
purchasing or will reside in the dwelling unit, an
accessible entrance shall be installed.
[2] To this end, the builder of restricted units shall deposit
funds within the Township of North Brunswick's Affordable
Housing Trust Fund sufficient to install accessible
entrances in 10% of the affordable units that have been
constructed with adaptable entrances.
[3] The funds deposited under Subsection B(1)(f)[2] above
shall be used by the Township of North Brunswick for the
sole purpose of making the adaptable entrance of an
affordable unit accessible when requested to do so by a
person with a disability who occupies or intends to occupy
the unit and requires an accessible entrance.
§ 195-45 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 195-45
194:382
[4] The developer of the restricted units shall submit a design
plan and cost estimate to the Construction Official of the
Township of North Brunswick for the conversion of
adaptable to accessible entrances.
[5] Once the Construction Official has determined that the
design plan to convert the unit entrances from adaptable
to accessible meet the requirements of the Barrier Free
SubCode, N.J.A.C. 5:23-7, and that the cost estimate of
such conversion is reasonable, payment shall be made to
the Township's Affordable Housing Trust Fund in care of
the Township Treasurer who shall ensure that the funds
are deposited into the Affordable Housing Trust Fund and
appropriately earmarked.
[6] Full compliance with the foregoing provisions shall not be
required where an entity can demonstrate that it is "site
impracticable" to meet the requirements. Determinations
of site impracticability shall be in compliance with the
Barrier Free SubCode, N.J.A.C. 5:23-7.
C. Design.
(1) In inclusionary developments, to the extent possible, low- and
moderate-income units shall be integrated with the market units.
(2) In inclusionary developments, low- and moderate-income units
shall have access to all of the same common elements and facilities
as the market units.

are permanently affixed to the unit or were included when the unit was
initially restricted (for example, refrigerator, range, washer, dryer,
dishwasher, wall-to-wall carpeting) shall be included in the maximum
allowable resale price. Other items may be sold to the purchaser at a
reasonable price that has been approved by the administrative agent at
the time of the signing of the agreement to purchase. The purchase of
central air conditioning installed subsequent to the initial sale of the
unit and not included in the base price may be made a condition of the
unit resale, provided the price, which shall be subject to ten-year,
straight-line depreciation, has been approved by the administrative
agent. Unless otherwise approved by the administrative agent, the
purchase of any property other than central air conditioning shall not
be made a condition of the unit resale. The owner and the purchaser
must personally certify at the time of closing that no unapproved
transfer of funds for the purpose of selling and receiving property has
taken place at the time of or as a condition of resale.
A. Control periods for restricted rental units shall be in accordance with
N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.11, as may be amended and supplemented, and each
restricted rental unit shall remain subject to the requirements of this
article for a period of at least 30 years, until North Brunswick takes
action to release the unit from such requirements. Prior to such action,
a restricted rental unit must remain subject to the requirements of
N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.1, as may be amended and supplemented.
B. Deeds of all real property that include restricted rental units shall
contain deed restriction language. The deed restriction shall have
priority over all mortgages on the property, and the deed restriction

Certificate of Occupancy.
C. A restricted rental unit shall remain subject to the affordability controls
of this article despite the occurrence of any of the following events:

the rent as stated on the lease. A copy of the form of the lease utilized
by the administrative agent for each type of restricted rental unit shall
be provided to the Municipal Housing Liaison prior to leasing the units.
In addition, the administrative agent shall provide to the Municipal
Housing Liaison prior to the beginning of marketing of any affordable
rental units, a detailed breakdown of the proposed rents for each
bedroom mix and income group indicating the formula and showing the
calculations utilized to determine the rents for each unit.

approval of the Municipal Housing Liaison.
C. Application fees (including the charge for any credit check) shall not
exceed 5% of the monthly rent of the applicable restricted unit and shall
be payable to the administrative agent to be applied to the costs of

a gross household income less than or equal to 30% of median
income.

exceed 35% (40% for age-restricted units) of the household's eligible
monthly income as determined pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.16, as may
be amended and supplemented; provided, however, that this limit may
be exceeded if one or more of the following circumstances exists:
(1) The household currently pays more than 35% (40% for households
eligible for age-restricted units) of its gross household income for
rent, and the proposed rent will reduce its housing costs;
(2) The household has consistently paid more than 35% (40% for
households eligible for age-restricted units) of eligible monthly
income for rent in the past and has proven its ability to pay;
(3) The household is currently in substandard or overcrowded living

unit.
C. The applicant shall file documentation sufficient to establish the
existence of the circumstances in Subsections A(1) through (3) and B(1)
through (5) above with the administrative agent, who shall counsel the
household on budgeting. The administrative agent shall provide the
Municipal Housing Liaison with a spreadsheet listing all approved
applicants who meet one of the circumstances identified above on a
quarterly basis. This spreadsheet shall identify the percentage of
monthly income represented by the rent, and the specific circumstance
in Subsection B(1) through (5) that has been met.
A. The Township of North Brunswick shall appoint a specific municipal
employee to serve as a Municipal Housing Liaison responsible for
administering the affordable housing plan, including affordability
controls, the North Brunswick Affirmative Marketing Plan (NBAMP),
monitoring and reporting, and, where applicable, supervising any
developer serving as administrative agent upon approval by resolution
of the Township Council, or any contracted administrative agent. North
Brunswick shall adopt an ordinance creating the position of Municipal
Housing Liaison. North Brunswick shall adopt a resolution appointing a
§ 195-55 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 195-56
194:390
§ 195-57. Administrative agent.
Municipal Housing Liaison. The Municipal Housing Liaison shall be
appointed by the Township Council and may be a full- or part-time
municipal employee. The Municipal Housing Liaison shall be approved
by the court and shall be duly qualified.
B. The Municipal Housing Liaison shall be responsible for oversight and
administration of the affordable housing program for the Township of
North Brunswick, including the following responsibilities which may
not be contracted out to an administrative agent:
(1) Serving as North Brunwick's primary point of contact for all
inquiries from the state, affordable housing providers,
administrative agents and interested households;
(2) Monitoring the status of all restricted units in North Brunswick's
HEFSP;
(3) Compiling, verifying and submitting annual monitoring reports as
may be required by the court;
(4) Coordinating meetings with affordable housing providers and
administrative agents, as needed;
(5) Attending continuing education opportunities on affordability
controls, compliance monitoring and affirmative marketing at least
annually and more often as needed; and
(6) Oversee review and approval of project-specific Affirmative
Marketing Plans (PSAMP), make recommendations to the Township
Council relative to whether a developer should be appointed as
administrative agent and whether the management plan should be
accepted as adequate.
C. Subject to the approval of the court, the Township of North Brunswick
shall designate one or more administrative agent(s) to administer newly
constructed or renovated affordable units in accordance with UHAC. An
operating manual for each new affordable housing development
incorporated into the HEFSP shall be provided by the administrative
agent(s) to the Municipal Housing Liaison. The Municipal Housing
Liaison shall determine if the operating manual is adequate. Said
operating manual is subject to approval of the court. The operating
manual shall be available for public inspection in the Community
Development Office, in the office of the Municipal Housing Liaison, and
in the office(s) of the administrative agent(s). The Municipal Housing
Liaison shall supervise both developers serving as administrative
agents and any contracted administrative agent(s).
A. The NBAMP provides minimum requirements that must be followed for
the marketing of affordable units in the Township. It also provides
options for the designation of administrative agents for each affordable
§ 195-56 HOTEL AND MOTEL ROOM OCCUPANCY TAX § 195-57
194:391
housing development. The Township shall provide the developer of
each affordable housing development the option to serve as the
administrative agent for the development if said developer can
document to the satisfaction of the Township that the company and
individuals from the company who will be involved in the marketing of
the project and the review of applications for approval have adequate
training to act in this capacity. The developer shall submit to the
Municipal Housing Liaison the qualifications of the company in order to
document that the company meets the requirements of UHAC [N.J.A.C.
5:80-26.14(e)]. The developer shall also submit an operating manual
that describes the management procedures and responsibilities for
processing applications in accordance with UHAC [N.J.A.C.
5:80-26.14(b)]. The Municipal Housing Liaison will make a
recommendation to the Township Council as to whether the developer
has the requisite experience and personnel have the required training
to act as administrative agent. The Township Council shall either adopt
a resolution designating the developer as the administrative agent,
or rejecting the developer's request to act as administrative agent. If
approved to act as administrative agent, the developer shall submit to
the Municipal Housing Liaison each year the name of the individual
who will be the contact person/responsible party for the North
Brunswick project. If a developer is designated as administrative agent
by the Township Council, the Township Council may revoke this
approval at any time if the Council determines that the administrative
agent fails to perform the functions of administrative agent in an
acceptable manner.
B. If the developer's application to act as administrative agent is rejected
by the Township Council, the Township Council shall contract with a
trained individual or company to provide the services of administrative
agent, and the developer shall be responsible for all costs of said
contract.
C. If the Township of North Brunswick does not approve a developer to
serve as administrative agent for an affordable housing project, then
the Township shall hire an independent entity to serve under contract
to and report to the Township. The fees of a contracted administrative
agent shall be paid by the owners of the affordable units for which the
services of the administrative agent are required. The administrative
agent shall perform the duties and responsibilities of an administrative
agent as set forth in UHAC, including those set forth in Sections
5:80-26.14, 16 and 18 thereof, which includes:
(1) Affirmative marketing.

(c) The administrative agent shall attend continuing education

A. The Township of North Brunswick shall adopt by resolution an
affirmative marketing plan, entitled North Brunswick Affirmative
Marketing Plan (NBAMP) subject to approval of the court that is
compliant with N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.15, as may be amended and
supplemented.
B. The NBAMP is a regional marketing strategy designed to attract buyers
and/or renters of all majority and minority groups, regardless of race,
creed, color, national origin, ancestry, marital or familial status, gender,
affectional or sexual orientation, disability, age or number of children to
housing units which are being marketed by a developer, sponsor or
owner of affordable housing. The NBAMP is intended to target those
potentially eligible persons who are least likely to apply for affordable
units in that region. It is a continuing program that directs marketing
activities toward Housing Region 3 and is required to be followed
throughout the period of restriction.
C. The affirmative marketing plan shall provide a regional preference for
all households that live and/or work in Housing Region 3, comprised of
Middlesex, Somerset, and Hunterdon Counties.
D. The Township desires to provide a preference for affordable housing to
low- to moderate-income veterans who served in time of war or other
emergency, as defined in Section 1 of P.L. 1963, c.171 (N.J.S.A.
§ 195-57 HOTEL AND MOTEL ROOM OCCUPANCY TAX § 195-58
194:395
§ 195-59. Enforcement of affordable housing regulations.
54:4-8.10). This preference shall apply to 10% of the affordable housing
units in each development. This preference shall be established in
the applicant selection process for available affordable units so that
applicants who are veterans who served in times of war or other
emergency, as referenced in this section, and who apply within 90
days of the initial marketing period shall receive preference for the
rental of 10% of the units. After the first 90 days of the initial onehundred-
twenty-day marketing period, if any of those units subject
to the preference remain available, then applicants from the general
public shall be considered for occupancy. Following the initial onehundred-
twenty-day marketing period, previously qualified applicants
and future qualified applicants who are veterans who served in times of
war or other emergency, as referenced in this section, shall be placed
on a special waiting list as well as the general waiting list. The veterans
on the special waiting list shall be given preference for affordable units,
as the units become available, whenever the percentage of preferenceoccupied
units falls below 10%.
E. The Township has the ultimate responsibility for adopting an
affirmative marketing plan and for the proper administration of the
affirmative marketing program, including initial sales and rentals and
resales and rerentals. The administrative agent designated by the
Township of North Brunswick for each specific project shall implement
the PSAMP developed and approved for his or her development to
assure the affirmative marketing of all affordable units.
F. In implementing the PSAMP, the administrative agent shall provide a
list of counseling services to low- and moderate-income applicants on
subjects such as budgeting, credit issues, mortgage qualification, rental
lease requirements, and landlord/tenant law.
G. The NBAMP and each approved PSAMP shall describe the media to be
used in advertising and publicizing the availability of housing. In
implementing the PSAMP, the administrative agent shall consider the
use of language translations where appropriate.
H. The affirmative marketing process for available affordable units shall
begin at least four months (120 days) prior to the expected date of
occupancy.
I. Applications for affordable housing shall be available in several
locations, including, at a minimum, the County Administration Building
and/or the county library for each county within the housing region; the
North Brunswick administration building and the North Brunswick
library, and the developer's rental office. Applications shall be mailed to
prospective applicants upon request.
J. The costs of advertising and affirmative marketing of the affordable
units shall be the responsibility of the developer, sponsor or owner.
§ 195-58 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 195-59
194:396
A. Upon the occurrence of a breach of any of the regulations governing the
affordable unit by an owner, developer or tenant, the municipality shall
have all remedies provided at law or equity, including but not limited to
foreclosure, tenant eviction, a requirement for household
recertification, acceleration of all sums due under a mortgage,
recuperation of any funds from a sale in violation of the regulations,
injunctive relief to prevent further violation of the regulations, entry on
the premises, and specific performance. Any and all costs incurred by
the Township to enforce the NBAMP shall be borne by the
administrative agent for the specific affordable housing project
associated with the violation.
B. After providing written notice of a violation to an owner, developer or
tenant of a low- or moderate-income unit and advising the owner,
developer or tenant of the penalties for such violations, the municipality
may take the following action(s) against the owner, developer or tenant
for any violation that remains uncured for a period of 60 days after
service of the written notice:
(1) The municipality may file a court action pursuant to N.J.S.A.
2A:58-11 alleging a violation or violations of the regulations
governing the affordable housing unit. If the owner, developer or
tenant is adjudged by the court to have violated any provision of the
regulations governing affordable housing units, the owner,
developer or tenant shall be subject to one or more of the following
penalties, at the discretion of the court:
(a) A fine of not more than $500 per day or imprisonment for a
period not to exceed 90 days, or both, provided that each and
every day that the violation continues or exists shall be
considered a separate and specific violation of these provisions
and not a continuation of the initial offense;
(b) In the case of an owner who has rented a low- or moderateincome
unit in violation of the regulations governing affordable
housing units, payment into the Township of North Brunswick
Affordable Housing Trust Fund of the gross amount of rent
illegally collected;
(c) In the case of an owner who has rented a low- or moderateincome
unit in violation of the regulations governing affordable
housing units, payment of an innocent tenant's reasonable
relocation costs, as determined by the court.
(2) The municipality may file a court action in the Superior Court
seeking a judgment that would result in the termination of the
owner's equity or other interest in the unit, in the nature of a
mortgage foreclosure. Any such judgment shall be enforceable as if
the same were a judgment of default of the first purchase money
mortgage and shall constitute a lien against the low- or moderateincome
unit.
§ 195-59 HOTEL AND MOTEL ROOM OCCUPANCY TAX § 195-59
194:397
(a) The judgment shall be enforceable, at the option of the
municipality, by means of an execution sale by the Sheriff, at
which time the low- and moderate-income unit of the violating
owner shall be sold at a sale price which is not less than the
amount necessary to fully satisfy and pay off any first purchase
money mortgage and prior liens and the costs of the
enforcement proceedings incurred by the municipality,
including attorney's fees. The violating owner shall have his
right to possession terminated as well as his title conveyed
pursuant to the Sheriff's sale.
(b) The proceeds of the Sheriff's sale shall first be applied to
satisfy the first purchase money mortgage lien and any prior
liens upon the low- and moderate-income unit. The excess, if
any, shall be applied to reimburse the municipality for any and
all costs and expenses incurred in connection with either the
court action resulting in the judgment of violation or the
Sheriff's sale. In the event that the proceeds from the Sheriff's
sale are insufficient to reimburse the municipality in full as
aforesaid, the violating owner shall be personally responsible
for the full extent of such deficiency, in addition to any and all
costs incurred by the municipality in connection with collecting
such deficiency. In the event that a surplus remains after
satisfying all of the above, such surplus, if any, shall be placed
in escrow by the municipality for the owner and shall be held in
such escrow for a maximum period of two years or until such
earlier time as the owner shall make a claim with the
municipality for such. Failure of the owner to claim such
balance within the two-year period shall automatically result in
a forfeiture of such balance to the municipality. Any interest
accrued or earned on such balance while being held in escrow
shall belong to and shall be paid to the municipality, whether
such balance shall be paid to the owner or forfeited to the
municipality.
(c) Foreclosure by the municipality due to violation of the
regulations governing affordable housing units shall not
extinguish the restrictions of the regulations governing
affordable housing units as the same apply to the low- and
moderate-income unit. Title shall be conveyed to the purchaser
at the Sheriff's sale, subject to the restrictions and provisions
of the regulations governing the affordable housing unit. The
owner determined to be in violation of the provisions of this
plan and from whom title and possession were taken by means
of the Sheriff's sale shall not be entitled to any right of
redemption.
(d) If there are no bidders at the Sheriff's sale, or if insufficient
amounts are bid to satisfy the first purchase money mortgage
and any prior liens, the municipality may acquire title to the

Division.
low- and moderate-income unit by satisfying the first purchase
money mortgage and any prior liens and crediting the violating
owner with an amount equal to the difference between the
first purchase money mortgage and any prior liens and costs
of the enforcement proceedings, including legal fees and the
maximum resale price for which the low- and moderate-income
unit could have been sold under the terms of the regulations
governing affordable housing units. This excess shall be
treated in the same manner as the excess which would have
been realized from an actual sale as previously described.
(e) Failure of the low- and moderate-income unit to be either sold
at the Sheriff's sale or acquired by the municipality shall
obligate the owner to accept an offer to purchase from any
qualified purchaser which may be referred to the owner by the
municipality, with such offer to purchase being equal to the
maximum resale price of the low- and moderate-income unit as
permitted by the regulations governing affordable housing
units.
(f) The owner shall remain fully obligated, responsible and liable
for complying with the terms and restrictions of governing
affordable housing units until such time as title is conveyed
from the owner.

the discharge of their duties, shall identify themselves by exhibiting
their Township photo identification.
(4) The North Brunswick Department of Community Development

personnel indicate that conditions exist on any premises,
subject to the jurisdiction of the Department of Community
Development, which are either an immediate threat to the
safety or health of persons using or in near proximity to the
premises or of such a nature that the delay necessary to secure
a warrant would render the inspection of no value in
confirming the existence of the suspected violation, an
inspection may be demanded and, if possible without the use of
force, made to determine whether or not a violation of the law
or regulations in fact exists.
§ 196-3 HOTEL AND MOTEL ROOM OCCUPANCY TAX § 196-3

either admit the Inspector to his dwelling unit or authorize the
owner or managing agent to do so. Any occupant who has been so
notified, has allowed the owner or managing agent to retain a key
to his dwelling unit and has not expressed any objection, in writing,
to the Inspector's entering his dwelling unit either to the
Department of Community Development or the Inspector or to the
owner or managing agent shall be deemed to have consented to the
inspection of his dwelling unit. Any occupant consenting to an
inspection who is unable to be present or to have a representative
present shall, upon notice from either the owner or the North
Brunswick Department of Community Development, give a key to
his unit to the owner or managing agent. Such key shall be
returned to the occupant within 24 hours after the inspection. It
shall be the further duty of the owner and/or any managing agent
to provide such assistance as may be reasonable and necessary to
enable the Inspector to gain access to all areas of the property and,
upon request, to accompany the Inspector during his inspection.
(8) When an Inspector observes what may be a structural deficiency,
this condition shall be referred to the North Brunswick Building
Department. This report shall be in writing and signed by the
Inspector.
(9) If, during any inspection, the Inspector shall find a condition which
is, or appears to be, in violation of the International Fire Code, the

AESTHETIC IMPROVEMENT CUT  The removal of the minimum extent
possible of the smallest and poorest specimens of trees so as to permit land
development while retaining the maximum number of larger and healthier
specimens of trees.
AVERAGED WOODED LOT  An inventory of a portion of each property
subject to the provisions of this article shall be made to establish the
average number of each species of tree within the area to be disturbed
(which includes any area from which trees are to be removed or cut down).
This inventory shall constitute the averaged wooded lot and shall be
determined as follows: the applicant shall select random one-tenth-acre
representative plots throughout the area to be disturbed, which plots shall
have comparable tree populations to the area to be disturbed generally.
Each representative plot shall be visibly marked by stakes or other
appropriate markers. The location of the representative one-tenth-acre
plots shall be subject to approval by the administrative officer. The number
of representative one-tenth-acre plots shall be equal to 50% of the number
of acres within the area to be disturbed (including any area from which
trees are to be removed or cut down); provided, however, that the number
of representative one-tenth-acre plots shall not be less than 10 unless
the area to be disturbed is one acre or less, in which event the entire
area to be disturbed (including the area from which trees may be cut
down or removed) shall be inventoried. Once the representative plots have
been identified and approved, each tree on each representative one-tenthacre
plot shall be inventoried by species and the average of each species
calculated from the total of each representative one-tenth-acre plot shall
be determined for the total of representative one-tenth-acre plots. That
average number of species shall represent the number of species of each
tree within the disturbed area and the composite of an averaged tree
species shall constitute the averaged wooded lot. (Specimen trees are not
part of the averaged wooded lot, as they are inventoried individually
throughout the entire tract.)
BOARD  The municipal agency, either Planning Board or Zoning Board of
Adjustment.

utilized in the replacement of existing trees shall be measured six inches
above the ground for trees with a four-inch caliper or less, and measured
12 inches above the ground for trees over a four-inch caliper. Diameter at a
point of measurement may appear in this section as the abbreviation "DPM."
DRIPLINE  A limiting line established by a series of perpendicular drop
points marking the maximum radius of the crown of an existing tree, but not
less than six feet from the trunk, whichever is greater.
HOMESTEAD LOT  A preexisting lot located within a zone permitting
single-family detached dwellings upon which is constructed one singlefamily
detached dwelling or upon which is proposed to be constructed one
single-family detached dwelling, and which property as a result of zoning
restrictions could not be further subdivided.

F. Those projects which, prior to the effective date hereof, have received
preliminary major subdivision approval, final major subdivision
approval or site plan approval; provided, however, that an amendment
to a major subdivision approval, site plan approval or preliminary major
subdivision approval which is made after the effective date of this
article and which modification or amendment impacts upon existing
trees shall be subject to the provisions of this article. Applications for
extension of preliminary major subdivision approval where further tree
removal is required shall be conditioned upon compliance with this
section where the application for extension has not been granted prior
to the effective date of this article.
A. Prior to the cutting down or removal of any tree which is subject to this
article, a permit shall be obtained from the administrative officer
entitled a "tree removal permit." The application for a tree removal
permit shall include a completed application on a form prescribed by

A. Where the application is in conjunction with a minor subdivision
application to create a homestead lot or lots, removal of trees up to 50%
of the number of trees on the proposed homestead lot(s) may be
removed without replacement trees required by this section. Removal
of specimen trees shall only be permitted where the location of a tree
forces the placement of a structure outside the permitted building
setbacks; where a tree whose location, angle or growth makes them a
hazard to a structure or human life; where the location or growth of a
tree inhibits the enjoyment of an outdoor pool, patio, or deck or such
proposed uses for which a building permit has issued; or removal of
specimen trees which are otherwise exempt. The removal of trees in
excess of 50% or the removal of specimen trees which are not exempt
requires a replacement plan based upon the standards set forth in Table
B-1 and Table B-2. For minor subdivision applicants, a statement of the
number and species of trees constituting the replacement plan,
together with a certification indicating that same will be planted, shall
be sufficient; provided, however, that no certificate of occupancy shall
issue for use of any structure built upon said lots created by said minor
subdivision until such time as evidence verifying the planting of the
replacement trees has been completed. Neither a performance nor a
maintenance bond shall be required in the case of a minor subdivision.
§ 205-40.5 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-40.6
198:514
B. Where the application for a tree removal permit is in conjunction with
an application for major subdivision or site plan approval or any minor
subdivision other than a subdivision to create homestead lots as set
forth in Chapter 205 of the Township Code, or relates to any other
property not otherwise exempt, the replacement plan shall include the
following:
(1) A site plan showing the size, location and species of all trees
constituting replacement trees to be planted within the disturbed
area or elsewhere on site.
(2) The site plan shall identify the lot and block numbers, the street
address, if known or assigned, and a certification of compliance
with the requirements of this section.
(3) Location of streams and watercourses.
(4) Location of slopes of greater than 10% where any tree removal is
proposed.
(5) The location(s) on the tract where tree removal is to take place.
(6) The total acreage of the tract.
(7) The total number of wooded acres to be disturbed within the tract.
(8) A specific plan for replacement of removed trees pursuant to

and slash is consistent with law. All efforts shall be made to
preserve specimen trees, including, if necessary, relocation of
infrastructure, roadways and building. Removal of any specimen
tree shall require specific approval, and any specimen trees
approved for removal shall be listed individually on the tree
removal permit.
C. All plans for replacement of removed trees shall be based upon the
following formulas:
(1) For trees as defined herein, replacement shall be based on the
percentage of the trees removed as set forth in Table B(1) below;
(2) Specimen trees as defined herein shall be replaced in accordance

D. In determining the DPM of specimen trees for purpose of the above
calculation, half-inch will be rounded up to the nearest whole inch and
less than half an inch will be rounded down to the nearest whole inch.
E. Any tree left standing which was designated for removal, or any tree
planted in compliance with other requirements of this article, shall be
credited against the total replacement count on a one-for-one basis;
provided, however, that trees required to be planted by the Board
within street rights-of-way as part of an approval for an application for
development shall receive no credit.
F. Wherever replacement trees are being planted pursuant to this section
and Tables B(1) and B(2), the species or type of replacement tree shall,
to the greatest degree practical, be the same as the species or type
removed from the tract.
G. In the event that the replacement of the required number of trees
cannot reasonably be achieved on site, the applicant may request or
may be required to contribute an amount equal to the cost of the
replacement tree, including installation and guaranty (twice the
current wholesale value of each unplanted tree) to a fund established
by the Township for the purpose of tree maintenance, tree preservation,
§ 205-40.6 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-40.6
198:516
§ 205-40.7. Application submittal; referral.
All applications for tree removal permits must be made to the administrative
officer. After determining that the application is complete, the
administrative officer shall provide written notice to the applicant that
the application for tree removal permit is complete and shall refer one
copy of the completed application for tree removal permit to the Township
Environmental Committee and the Township Engineer, together with a
written request that they review the application and provide their
comments and recommendations within 35 days of the date of the letter of
transmittal. After 35 days from a referral to the Township Environmental
Committee and the Township Engineer, the administrative officer shall
approve or deny the application for tree removal permit. If denied, a
statement of reasons supporting the denial shall accompany the denial.
Due consideration shall be given by the administrative officer to the timely
receipt of comments and recommendations of the Township Environmental
Committee and the Township Engineer. Where approval is given, no permit
shall issue until the applicant provides a performance guaranty as required
in § 205-40.13. No performance guaranty may be released until full
compliance with the approval permit has been made, all required
replacement trees have been installed and an appropriate maintenance
bond has been posted in accordance with this section. Where the
application is approved, a tree removal permit shall issue as hereinabove
described.
§ 205-40.8. Waiver.
tree planting, landscaping, and including the donation of trees to be
planted within North Brunswick Township.
A. Where an applicant seeks a waiver from the strict enforcement of this
article, an application completed except for those portions for which
waiver is sought shall be submitted and referred for comment and
recommendation to the Environmental Committee and the Township
Engineer as described in § 205-40.7. After 35 days have elapsed from
date of said referral, the application, together with all supporting data,
the comments and recommendations of the Environmental Committee
and of the Township Engineer shall be forwarded to the Board if in
conjunction with an application for development for consideration of
the application for waiver. If not in conjunction with an application for
development, determination of the application of waiver shall be made
by the administrative officer. Such determination of the administrative
officer may be appealed to the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
B. When determining whether or not to grant a waiver of full technical
compliance with the requirements of this article and the requirements
for replacement trees, the administrative officer or the Board, as the
case may be, shall weigh the negative impacts of the proposed waiver
versus the benefits of compliance and shall consider the following:
§ 205-40.6 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-40.8
198:517
§ 205-40.9. Regulations pertaining to delineation of clearing limits/
limits of disturbance.
(1) Is it reasonably economically feasible for the applicant to comply
with this article based upon the character and extent of the
application for development? An applicant seeking a waiver on this
ground shall submit a certification setting forth the anticipated cost
of all construction and soft costs, including public improvements,
structures, detention basins, layout, design, engineering, legal, as
well as the anticipated sale price of the property to be sold or
market value of the property upon completion. In no event shall a
reduction in the number of replacement trees be greater than 1/2
of the original number required pursuant to this article.
(2) The minimal degree of land disturbance in comparison with the
overall size of the tract. For example, land disturbance of less than
10% of the overall size of the tract with no future plans for
development of the tract remaining undisturbed would be an
extraordinarily low percentage of land disturbance and could
justify reducing the number of replacement trees; provided,
however, that if the remaining undeveloped portion of the property
were to be developed within five years, all waived replacement
trees would be reinstated as a condition of future development.
(3) The proposed use of the property includes at least 20% low- and
moderate-income housing units.
(4) A lot in a single-family detached dwelling zone of five acres or less
upon which there is an existing single-family detached dwelling or
upon which a single-family detached dwelling will be constructed
which has the possibility of further subdivision based on the Zoning
Ordinance but upon which the applicant seeks no further
development or a subdivision. In such cases, a waiver respecting
replacement trees similar to homestead lots may be approved by
the Planning Board; provided, however, that if the property is
subdivided within five years, then the applicant must comply with
the tree replacement criteria for the category of application, i.e.,
subdivision, minor subdivision or major subdivision or site plan
application for both the existing lot, including any waved
replacement trees, and the proposed lot or lots.
C. After its determination on the application for waiver, the Board shall
forthwith provide a copy of its resolution to the administrative officer
who shall incorporate the Board's determination into the determination
on the application for tree removal permit.
A. The clearing limits/limits of disturbance shown on the replacement plan
shall be fully established prior to cutting of permitted wooded acreage
and shall be defined by snow fencing firmly secured along the dripline,
but not less than six feet from the trunk, of the remaining trees. In a like
manner, specimen trees and isolated groupings of trees which are to

§ 205-40.10. Permit approval; time for decision; no default
approvals.
§ 205-40.11. Change in replacement plan.
Any substantial change in a replacement plan shall necessitate the
submission of a revised plan to the administrative officer for review and
approval pursuant to this article.
§ 205-40.12. Permit revocation.
The administrative officer may revoke a permit where there has been a
false or misleading application or for noncompliance with an approved
replacement plan.
remain on the site shall be clearly protected by snow fencing or equally
visible and protective device installed along the dripline of the trees but
not less than six feet from the tree trunk(s).
B. The grade of the land located along the dripline shall not be raised or
lowered more than six inches unless compensated by welling or
retaining wall methods; and in no event shall the welling or retaining
wall methods be less than six feet from the trunk of the tree.
C. No soil stockpiling, storage of building materials or equipment
operation shall be permitted within the dripline or within six feet of any
remaining trees, whichever is greater.
D. Any clearing within the dripline, or within six feet of the trunk of a
remaining tree, must be done by hand or with hand-operated
equipment.
E. Where clearing and/or construction on the site results in accidental
removal or severe damage which will eventually result in death and
removal of any tree delineated in a replacement plan as remaining on
site, such removed or damaged tree shall be replaced pursuant to the
applicable replacement tree schedule in § 205-40.6C hereof using
substantially comparable species and type trees.
A. A tree removal permit shall be acted upon within a reasonable time of
the determination by the administrative officer that a completed
application has been submitted.
B. An application for development may be conditioned upon the
subsequent approval of a tree removal permit.
C. An approval by statutory default by virtue of a Board failing to act upon
application development within a prescribed statutory time period shall
not automatically grant approval of a tree removal permit and shall not
be deemed to be an approval of a request for a waiver of the application
of any portion of this article to an applicant for development.

§ 205-40.13. Fees; performance guaranties; maintenance
guaranties.
§ 205-40.14. Notice of commencement of tree removal.
A. A nonrefundable application fee of $75 shall be submitted, together
with a review and inspection fee of $200, for the first acre and $100 for
each additional acre or portion thereof on which tree removal activities
are proposed.
B. An escrow fee, in an amount not less than 1% of the estimated
replacement cost or $500, whichever is greater, may be required to
cover expenses of review of the application and site inspection
subsequent to completion of the tree removal activities. Any unused
balance will be returned to the applicant after final approval.
C. A performance guaranty shall be submitted upon approval of an
application in favor of the municipality in an amount not to exceed
120% of the cost for the replacement plan on the property in an amount
estimated by the Township Engineer. This should exclude off-tract trees,
for which a contribution was made.
D. Notwithstanding any limitations set forth in Chapter 205, Land Use,
following completion of the planting of trees in accordance with the
approved replacement plan and as a condition of the release of the
performance guaranty, the permit holder shall post a maintenance
guaranty with the Township Clerk for maintenance of the replacement
trees. The maintenance guaranty, which may be a surety bond, shall not
exceed 15% of the costs of the replacement plan and shall be posted for
a period not to exceed two years after acceptance of the completed
replacement plan. Under the maintenance guaranty, an 85% survival
rate for a two-year guaranty period shall be considered satisfactory.
A. The holder of a tree removal permit shall notify the administrative
officer in writing at least seven business days in advance to when tree
removal activity will commence. No activity shall take place on
Saturdays, Sundays or legal holidays without express written approval
from the administrative officer.
B. The notice shall also include advice as to the manner of disposal of the
removed trees. Where appropriate, the administrative officer shall
advise the Township Recycling Coordinator of the name of the permit
holder, the location of the removal site, the date removal is to
commence and the manner of disposal to be employed.

The following uses shall be permitted in R-7 Residential District:
A. It is recognized that there exists an inadequate supply of decent, safe

which the elderly can afford. These specific needs and requirements
can best be met through the sponsorship of an elderly housing project
by a nonprofit corporation.

for the elderly, the following provisions are designed to facilitate the
participation of a private nonprofit corporation to develop a senior
citizen housing project.
A. Permitted principal uses.
(1) Multistoried, senior citizen housing which is subsidized in
accordance with state or federal programs, or which is otherwise
marketed at a price which makes it affordable to lower-income
families.

(3) Temporary buildings for uses incidental to construction work,
provided that such buildings are removed upon completion or
abandonment of the construction work.
B. Required accessory uses.

parking may be located in any front, side or rear yard area,
provided that such parking is not closer than 15 feet to any
property line.

ARTICLE XIVA
C-4 Nonrestricted Commercial District
[Added 5-17-2010 by Ord. No. 10-12103]
§ 205-68.1. Purpose.
§ 205-68.2. Applicability.
The C-4 District shall encompass the following properties:
§ 205-68.3. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AFFORDABLE HOUSING  Affordable housing is defined in this article
as it is defined in the New Jersey Fair Housing Act, N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301
et seq., as same may be amended from time to time. Should the New
Jersey Fair Housing Act be amended to permit a municipality to meet all or
A. The purpose of this zone is to provide a new commercial district that
allows for general commercial uses as well as large retail
establishments and drive-in retail uses. However, retail centers that
include large retail establishments with individual users occupying in
excess of 50,000 square feet typically have several uninspiring design
features in common, including no-frill site plans that eschew connection
to the surrounding community and environs; plain vanilla,
standardized, rectangular single-story buildings; monolithic, smoothsurface
block facades; recognizable corporate color schemes; minimal
architectural details; massive asphalt parking lots covering several
acres; limited landscaping; few pedestrian amenities. The Township of
North Brunswick will not permit this standardized mediocrity. As a
result, the Township is enacting form-based guidelines that will require
the large retail establishments to relate better to the community and
have less negative impact upon the environment. This will be achieved
through integrating the large retail establishments into the fabric of the
development and the surrounding community.
B. The intent of the regulations incorporated herein is to bring pedestrians
and bicyclists into the site and to allow them to maneuver safely
throughout the site on a series of interconnected pedestrian pathways.
As a result of these regulations, large retail establishments will
incorporate pedestrian-scale features into the design of their buildings
and the parking lots that surround them.
A. Block 224, Lots 1 thorough 12, 12.01, 12.02 and 87; and Block 223, Lots
1, 2, and 3.01 through 3.03. [Amended 11-1-2010 by Ord. No.
10-28]
103. Editor's Note: This ordinance also provided that should § 205-68.4D(2)(a) be adjudged
invalid by the courts, this entire article shall be deemed invalid.

housing" to the extent said housing can meet the affordable housing
obligation of the Township.

than 30% of the unit's width.
DUPLEX LOFT  A dwelling unit, with a private entrance, on an individual
lot, attached horizontally in a linear arrangement to another dwelling unit

A. Purpose.
114. Editor's Note: This ordinance also provided that should § 205-76.1B be adjudged invalid by
the courts, this entire section shall be deemed invalid.
§ 205-75.3 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-76.1
198:596
(1) The Township of North Brunswick strongly supports the concepts
of smart growth and sustainability. In order to promote these
concepts, the Township has determined to provide the option for
the development of a transit-oriented mixed-use development
within the I-2 Industrial Zone District just south of Cozzens Lane/
Adams Lane. This development will have to meet the standards set
forth in § 205-76.1B of this chapter. Such development will provide
concentrated mixed-use development at residential densities and
with nonresidential floor areas that are compatible with both
commuter bus service and rail transportation. In this regard, the
Township of North Brunswick strongly supports the location of a
New Jersey Transit train station in the transit-oriented mixed-use
development and the Township of North Brunswick further strongly
supports all required transit improvement and roadway work
related to the proposed train station both within the transitoriented
mixed-use development and off site from the transitoriented
mixed-use development, which may include, but not be
limited to, the proposed New Jersey Transit rail turn back loop at
Black Horse Lane and a proposed new Route 1 to Route 130 eastwest
connector roadway proposed to be located between Adams
Lane and Black Horse Lane.
(2) Given the current state of the economy and the sagging retail
climate, the Township believes that large retail establishments are
the necessary catalyst or economic engine to bring the transitoriented
mixed-use development to fruition. As a result, these
development regulations permit large retail establishments to
represent a high proportion of the nonresidential development in
the transit-oriented mixed-use development.
(3) However, retail centers that include large retail establishments
with individual users occupying in excess of 50,000 square feet
typically have several uninspiring design features in common:
(a) No-frill site plans that eschew connection to the surrounding
community and environs.
(b) Plain vanilla, standardized, rectangular single-story buildings.
(c) Monolithic, smooth-surface block facades.
(d) Recognizable corporate color schemes.
(e) Minimal architectural details.
(f) Massive asphalt parking lots covering several acres.
(g) Limited landscaping.
(h) Few pedestrian amenities.
(4) While the Township supports smart growth, the Township of North
Brunswick's vision for this mixed-use transit-oriented development
§ 205-76.1 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-76.1
198:597
differs significantly from this standardized mediocrity. As a result,
the Township is enacting form-based guidelines that will require
the large retail establishments to relate better to the community
and have less negative impact upon the environment. This will be
achieved through integrating the large retail establishments into
the fabric of the development and the surrounding community.
(5) The intent of the regulations incorporated herein is to bring
pedestrians and bicyclists into the site and to allow them to
maneuver safely throughout the site from store to store, to the
future train station and bus depot, and to public spaces on a series
of interconnected pedestrian pathways. As a result of these
regulations, large retail establishments will incorporate
pedestrian-scale features into the design of their buildings and the
parking lots that surround them. In effect, large retail
establishments shall become a part of the Main Street
environment, as opposed to clashing with the Main Street
environment.
B. Application of Transit-Oriented Mixed-Use Development Overlay
regulations.
(1) In addition to the principal, conditional and accessory uses
permitted in the I-2 Industrial Zone District, the owner of a tract
within the I-2 Industrial Zone District which meets the
requirements set forth below shall have the option of developing
that tract with a transit-oriented mixed-use development. Should
the owner of a tract within the I-2 Industrial Zone District elect to
develop its tract with a transit-oriented mixed-use development,
then the use, bulk and design standards of this section, § 205-76.1,
shall supersede the otherwise applicable provisions of Chapter 205.
Only tracts meeting all of the standards set forth below can be
developed with a transit-oriented mixed-use development. If a tract
does not meet each of the standards below, then the standards of
§ 205-76.1 shall not be applicable and large retail establishments,
general retail use, hotels and residential uses shall continue to be
prohibited uses in the zone. These necessary requirements are:
(a) The tract shall be located within the I-2 Industrial Zone
District.
(b) The tract shall be a minimum of 200 contiguous acres in area.
(c) The site plan or general development plan for the transitoriented
mixed-use development on the tract shall provide a
location for a bus depot with associated parking and a New
Jersey transit train station with associated parking.
(d) The plan for the development of a transit-oriented mixed-use
development on the tract shall incorporate all off-tract roadway
improvements necessary to meet the travel time delay
performance standards established by the Planning Board as
§ 205-76.1 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-76.1
198:598
critical to exercising the option to build under the overlay
zoning standards.
[1] The Planning Board authorized a traffic study to determine
what types of off-tract traffic improvements would have to
be constructed in close proximity to the site in order for
the Planning Board to recommend the rezoning of the
property to allow for the option to build a transit-oriented
mixed-use development. The traffic study also factored in
trips to be generated from a proposed large retail
establishment of approximately 100,000 square feet in
building area on the southbound side of Route 1 directly
across from the proposed transit-oriented mixed-use
development. This study, prepared by Maser Consulting,
and referred to herein as the "Maser Study," broke the
proposed transit-oriented mixed-use development down
into two phases known as "Phase 1" and "the Final Build
Phase." The Maser Study recommended specific roadway
improvements to accommodate the Phase 1 and the Final
Build Phase development. The "Summary of
Recommended Developer Improvements for Site
Rezoning" of the Maser Study identifies the improvements
necessary to satisfy the Planning Board's requirement that
the development of a transit-oriented mixed-use
development would actually improve traffic congestion in
proximity to the site for Phase 1 development. These
improvements also account for the proposed large retail
establishment of approximately 100,000 square feet in
building area on the southbound side of Route 1 directly
across from the proposed transit-oriented mixed-use
development.
[2] The Maser Study states grade-separated interchanges may
be required at the Route 1 intersections of Finnegans
Lane, Commerce Boulevard and Cozzens/Adams Lane,
along with a possible reverse jughandle at Aaron Road.
The Maser Study shows conceptual designs of how such
grade-separated interchanges may occur to accommodate
the train station and the Final Build Phase. The final
determination of the need for these grade-separated
interchanges, and the specific design of same, would be
determined by the NJDOT in conjunction with New Jersey
Transit Corporation's commitment to locate a train station
adjacent to the site.
[3] While the ultimate approval authority for some of the offtract
improvements recommended in the Maser Study is
the State Department of Transportation and/or the County
of Middlesex, the Maser Study provides clear analysis and
recommendations relative to the type of improvements
§ 205-76.1 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-76.1
198:599
necessary to meet the Planning Board's criteria. Realizing
that the state and/or county may require modifications to
the recommendations in the Maser Study, it is the clear
intention of the Planning Board that the developer may
only exercise the option to construct Phase 1 of the transitoriented
mixed-use development by complying with
Subsection B(1)(d)[4][a], [b] or [c] below, as part of its
application for Phase 1.
[4] The developer may only exercise the overlay district option
to construct the Final Build Phase of the transit-oriented
mixed-use development upon satisfying the
implementation of the recommended final build
improvements described in the Maser Study in conjunction
with the construction of a train station, or by adhering to
the standards of Subsection B(1)(d)[4][c] below.
[a] The developer shall build 100% of the improvements
(with the exclusion of the far-side jughandle on Route
1 northbound at Aaron Road) recommended in
Chapter VIII of the Maser Study under "Summary of
Recommended Developer Improvements for Site
Rezoning," and be responsible for 100% of the cost of
said improvements, subject to modification by the
state or county, if the development of the transitoriented
mixed-use development proceeds to
construction and the large retail establishment
proposed on the southbound side of Route 1 does not
proceed to construction; or
[b] The developer shall build 100% of the improvements
recommended in Chapter VIII of the Maser Study
under "Summary of Recommended Developer
Improvements for Site Rezoning," and be responsible
for a proportionate share of the cost, subject to
modification by the state or county, if the development
of the large retail establishment on the southbound
side of Route 1 proceeds to construction in a similar
time frame to the transit-oriented mixed-use
development. Said proportionate distribution of cost
shall be based upon external trips generated by each
development, as specifically enumerated in Table 19 of
the Maser Study; or
[c] Prior to filing an initial application with the Planning
Board, or filing any request for amendment to a
previously obtained approval, the developer may
submit an alternative traffic analysis or revised
project gross floor area, and submit revised roadway
improvement plans to the Planning Board in an
attempt to demonstrate that modifications to the
§ 205-76.1 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-76.1
198:600
recommended roadway improvements will satisfy the
Planning Board relative to travel time delays. Said
alternate plans may result from consultation with the
NJDOT, Middlesex County, NJDEP, New Jersey Transit
or any other governmental agency, or from changes
necessitated by environmental, utility or right-of-way
constraints or for any other reason that would render
the specific Maser Study recommendations unfeasible
or impractical to implement or for any other reason.
Should the Planning Board determine by resolution
that it will accept alternative improvement plans, said
alternative improvement plans shall be detailed within
the resolution, and said resolution shall supplement
or supersede the off-tract improvement standards
incorporated in the Maser Study. Failure to provide
for the off-tract improvements standards incorporated
in the Maser Study through Subsection B(2)(d)[1] or
[2] above or this Subsection B(2)(d)[3], or as amended
and approved by the Planning Board herein, shall
result in the application for a transit-oriented mixeduse
development being classified as a nonpermitted
use, thereby causing the Planning Board to lack
jurisdiction over the application.
(e) The transit-oriented mixed-use development shall be designed
so that a minimum of 10% of all energy projected to be
consumed on the tract, as determined by the estimated energy
demand, is generated from renewable sources inclusive of, but
not limited to, geothermal, wind, fuel cell, solar or any other
renewable technology.
(f) No more than 370,000 square feet of the retail floor area of the
transit-oriented mixed-use development shall be located in
freestanding, one-story retail buildings. The number of
freestanding large retail establishments shall be limited to two
buildings. All other large retail establishments shall either
include two stories of usable retail space, or shall be developed
as mixed-use buildings or mixed-use retail commercial
buildings with residential units and/or other permitted uses
located above the large retail establishment.
(g) Twelve and two-tenths percent of the housing units in the
transit-oriented mixed-use development shall be affordable
housing units. If all of the 1,875 residential units in the transitoriented
mixed-use development are approved and constructed
as part of the transit-oriented mixed-use development, then
229 or 12.2% of these residential units will be affordable
housing units. This total of 229 affordable housing units shall
satisfy any and all current and future affordable housing
obligations of any kind for the entire full build out of the
§ 205-76.1 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-76.1
198:601
transit-oriented mixed-use development, provided that the
transit-oriented mixed-use development does not contain more
than 1,875 residential units. Under no circumstances will more
than 229 residential units of the 1,875 total residential units
in the transit-oriented mixed-use development be affordable
housing units. The 229 affordable housing units are part of
and included in amount of the 1,875 total residential units
allowable in the transit-oriented mixed-use development.
Because the transit-oriented mixed-use development will
provide such affordable housing units, no development fees,
fees-in-lieu of affordable housing, or any other monetary
obligation for affordable housing purposes shall be due as a
result of the construction of any component of the transitoriented
mixed-use development. [Amended 4-21-2014 by
Ord. No. 14-03]
[1] All of the 229 affordable housing units will be rental units,
and will be dispersed throughout the buildings in the
transit-oriented mixed-use development which contain
rental units. All of the 229 affordable housing units will be
family units.
[2] All of the 229 affordable housing units shall be subject to
thirty-year deed restrictions in conformance with N.J.A.C.
5:80-26.5.
[3] If all 1,875 residential units in the transit-oriented mixeduse
development are constructed: [Amended 7-25-2016
by Ord. No. 16-12]
[a] One hundred fourteen, approximately 50%, of the
affordable housing units in the transit-oriented mixeduse
development will be moderate-income units.
[b] Ninety-two, approximately 40%, of the affordable
housing units in the transit-oriented mixed-use
development will be Tier 1 low-income units.
[c] Eighteen, approximately 8%, of the affordable housing
units in the transit-oriented mixed-use development
will be Tier 2 low-income units.
[d] Five, approximately 2%, of the affordable housing
units in the transit-oriented mixed-use development
will be very-low-income units.
[4] The timing of the construction of the affordable housing
units in the transit-oriented mixed-use development will be
as follows: [Amended 7-25-2016 by Ord. No. 16-12]
[a] In accordance with the Housing Element and Fair
Share Plan adopted by the Planning Board on June 23,

to commencement of construction on a platform for a
train station. Before the Township Construction Code
Official issues the certificate of occupancy for the
349th market rate unit in the transit-oriented mixeduse
development, the Township Construction Code
Official shall have issued certificates of occupancy for:
17 moderate-income units, 29 Tier 1 low-income units
and five very-low-income units.
[b] Before the Township Construction Code Official issues
the certificate of occupancy for the 823rd market rate
unit in the transit-oriented mixed-use development,
the Township Construction Code Official shall have
issued certificates of occupancy for: 45 moderateincome
units, 36 Tier 1 low-income units, four Tier 2
low-income units and five very-low-income units.

defined below have the definitions given to them in § 205-7 of this
chapter, and, if not defined therein, the definitions given them in the
Municipal Land Use Law, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq.
AFFORDABLE HOUSING  Affordable housing is defined in this
section as it is defined in the New Jersey Fair Housing Act, N.J.S.A.
52:27D-301 et seq., as same may be amended from time to time. Should
the New Jersey Fair Housing Act be amended to permit a municipality
to meet all or some portion of its affordable housing obligation through
the provision of workforce housing, as this term is defined in the New
Jersey Fair Housing Act, then in this section "affordable housing" also
means "workforce housing" to the extent said housing can meet the
affordable housing obligation of the Township generated by the transitoriented
mixed-use development.
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS  Moderate-income units, Tier 1 lowincome
units and Tier 2 low-income units.[Added 4-21-2014 by Ord.

place for climbing plants to grow, while providing shaded seating,
directional form to frame a view or to create a private out-of-doors area.
An arbor can be arched or square-topped. It differs from a gazebo in
that its roof area is open to the elements, while a gazebo traditionally
has a solid roof that protects those seated beneath it from the elements.
ARCADE  A structure providing shade, cover or protection from the
elements, extending over a sidewalk or square, open to the street
except for supporting columns, piers or arches. Arcades shall have a
minimum clear height of 11 feet over a sidewalk and a minimum clear

of the columns supporting the arcade. The area within an arcade shall
be open to public access. Supporting columns/piers shall be located no
more than 230 inches from the back of the curb. Where an arcade is
built, the requirement for street trees is waived for that street frontage.

Y. General provisions.
(1) The requirements of the Transit-Oriented Mixed-Use Development
Overlay render the transit-oriented mixed-use development eligible
for the general development plan provisions of this section and the
Municipal Land Use Law.115
(2) The nature of the transit-oriented mixed-use development is such
that lots and uses are not required to front on a public street for the
purposes of subdivision, provided that adequate vehicular,
emergency and pedestrian access is provided to individual lots and
uses thereon.
(3) The intent of the Planning Board and Township Council is to
encourage innovation and creativity in creating a unique and
special place for the Township of North Brunswick. Accordingly, the
standards provided herein, with the exception of use, density and
standards in § 205-76.1B that trigger the application of the overlay
option, shall be considered bulk standards. It is anticipated that the
Planning Board will grant a bulk variance for said standards upon a
finding that the strict application of a particular standard in
question is impracticable because of the peculiar condition relating
to the issue before it. The Planning Board may also find the
granting of a variance from the standard would result in a better
plan and advance the purpose of the Master Plan and Land Use
Ordinance to create a vibrant transit-oriented mixed-use
development for the community.
(4) Approved colors/palettes.

§ 205-79.4. Large retail establishments. [Added 2-22-2011 by Ord.
No. 11-02123]
(b) Construction phasing, location and affirmative marketing
requirements. All low- and moderate-income units are subject
to the requirements of § 205-45.2B through E.
A. Purpose.
(1) The purpose of this section is to allow large retail establishments to
be located in the TMU Zone upon complying with specific design
standards. However, retail centers that include large retail
establishments with individual users occupying in excess of 50,000
square feet typically have several uninspiring design features in
common, including no-frill site plans that eschew connection to the
surrounding community and environs; plain vanilla, standardized,
rectangular single-story buildings; monolithic, smooth-surface
block facades; recognizable corporate color schemes; minimal
architectural details; massive asphalt parking lots covering several
acres; limited landscaping; few pedestrian amenities. The
Township of North Brunswick will not permit this standardized
mediocrity. As a result, the Township is enacting form-based
guidelines that will require the large retail establishments to relate
better to the community and have less negative impact upon the
environment. This will be achieved through integrating the large
retail establishments into the fabric of the development and the
surrounding community.
(2) The intent of the regulations incorporated herein is to bring
pedestrians and bicyclists into the site and to allow them to
maneuver safely throughout the site on a series of interconnected
pedestrian pathways. As a result of these regulations, large retail
establishments will incorporate pedestrian-scale features into the
design of their buildings and the parking lots that surround them.
B. Applicability. Large retail establishments shall be permitted uses in the
TMU District only upon satisfying the following standards:
(1) The property upon which said use is to be located shall have a
minimum frontage of 500 feet on Route 1.
(2) The developer shall make a financial contribution towards the cost
of certain traffic improvements (the "traffic improvements")
identified in a traffic study prepared by Maser Consulting, dated
January 20, 2010, and entitled "NBTOD Traffic Study for North
Brunswick Transit Village (Block 148, Lot 5.04) and BJ Wholesale
Club (Block 4.6, Lot 1.04) Township of North Brunswick, Middlesex
County, New Jersey" ("Maser Report"). Said contribution shall be
123. Editor's Note: This ordinance also indicated that if § 205-79.4B(2) and (3) were adjusted
to be invalid, the entire ordinance would be deemed invalid.
§ 205-79.3 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-79.4
198:695
made prior to the developer receiving a construction permit for the
large retail establishment. The actual amount of the contribution
shall be adjusted upward or downward based upon the actual costs
of the design, permitting and construction of the improvements.
Any additional contribution shall be made within 90 days of the
date that written documentation is provided to the developer that
the cost of the roadway improvements exceeds the estimate in the
Maser Report. Failure of the developer to provide the additional
funding within 90 days of notification shall result in the Township
withdrawing the certificate of occupancy for the large retail
establishment, requiring the large retail establishment to cease
operations until said contribution is deposited with the Township.
(3) The developer shall dedicate to the Township of North Brunswick,
prior to the issuance of a construction permit, the right-of-way
anticipated to be necessary for a three-lane reverse jughandle on
southbound Route 1 at Commerce Boulevard in accordance with
the Maser Traffic Study. Said right-of-way shall also include an
additional four feet of right-of-way outside the proposed pavement
area for roadway maintenance.
(4) The developer shall enter into an agreement with the Township
which shall address the financial contribution and right-of-way
dedication, and which shall include provisions regarding
adjustment of the area of dedication, to meet DOT design criteria,
subject to agreed-upon limitations, including a maximum area of
dedication of 1.5 acres and the loss of a maximum of 40 parking
spaces.
(5) The developer shall obtain NJDOT approval and make the
necessary signal retiming and restriping improvements to the
intersections of Aaron Road and Commerce Boulevard with Route
1, recommended on Pages 8 and 9 of the report prepared by Maser
Consulting entitled "Addendum to NBTOD Traffic Study for BJ
Wholesale Club, Block 4.46, Lot 1.04, North Brunswick, Middlesex
County, New Jersey," dated March 17, 2010 (the "Maser
Addendum"). The developer shall have no responsibility for interim
(or permanent) road widening or signal improvements if mandated
by NJDOT.
C. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the

for housing of all types and design; to provide for necessary commercial
facilities conveniently located to such housing; to provide for well-located,
clean, safe and pleasant residential, commercial and industrial development
so that the growing demands of the population may be met by greater
variety in type, design and layout of buildings and by the conservation and
more efficient use of open space ancillary to said buildings; so that greater
opportunities for better housing and recreation, shops and industrial plants
conveniently located to each other may extend to all citizens and residents
of the Township; and in order to encourage a more efficient use of land
and of public services or private services in lieu thereof; and to reflect
changes in the technology of land development so that resulting economies
may inure to the benefit of those who need homes; to lessen the burden of
traffic on streets and highways; to conserve the value of the land; and, in
aid of these purposes, to provide a procedure which can relate the type,
design and layout of residential, commercial and industrial development
and other facilities, including the foregoing, at the time of development in
a manner consistent with the preservation of the property values within
established residential areas and to ensure that the increased flexibility of
substantive regulations over land development authorized herein is subject
to such administrative standards and procedures as shall encourage the
disposition of proposals for land development without undue delay, the
following standards, procedures and requirements shall apply.
§ 205-83. Objectives.
The Township of North Brunswick wishes to take full advantage of such
modern design construction technology and planning methods as will
advance and promote the sound growth and general welfare of the
Township; strengthen and sustain its economic potentials; provide safe,
efficient and economic municipal services; and establish appropriate
patterns for the distribution of population, commerce and industry
compatible with a modern way of life, coordinated with the protection and
enhancement of natural beauty and resources; and in order to provide for a
variety of service activities, parks, playgrounds, recreational areas, parking
and other open space in orderly relationship to each other and in conformity
with the development of the Township as a whole. In order to effectuate the

explosions, toxic and noxious matter, radiation and other hazards
and from offensive noise, vibration, smoke, dust and other
particulate matter, odorous matter, heat, humidity, glare and other
objectionable influences, permitting such development in areas
where this chapter restricts the emission of such nuisances,
without regard to the industrial products and processes involved.
(4) Protecting adjacent residential and commercial areas and
protecting the labor force in other establishments engaged in less
offensive types of manufacturing and related activities.
(5) Protecting industrial and related development against congestion,
as far as is possible and appropriate in each area, by limiting the
bulk of buildings in relation to the land around them and to one
another and by providing space off public streets for parking and
loading facilities associated with such activities.
(6) Promoting the most desirable use of land and direction of building
development in accordance with a well-considered plan to promote
stability of industrial and related development, to strengthen the
economic base of the Township, to protect the character of the

maintain the common open space shall, at any time after
establishment of the planned unit development, fail to maintain
the common open space in reasonable order and condition in
accordance with the plan, the Planning Board shall serve
written notice upon such organization or upon the residents
and owners of the planned unit development setting forth the
manner in which the organization has failed to maintain the
common open space in reasonable condition, and said notice
shall include a demand that such deficiencies of maintenance
be cured within 30 days thereof and shall state the date and
§ 205-87 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-87
198:724
place of hearing thereon which shall be held within 14 days of
the notice.
(b) At such hearing the Planning Board may modify the terms of
the original notice as to the deficiencies set forth in the original
notice; or, if the modifications thereof shall not be cured within
said 30 days or any extension thereof, the Planning Board, in
order to preserve the taxable values of the properties within
the planned unit development and to prevent the common open
space from becoming a nuisance, may enter upon said common
space and maintain the same for a period of one year. Said
entry and maintenance shall not vest in the public any rights to
use the common open space except where the same is
voluntarily dedicated to the public by the residents and
owners.
(c) Before the expiration of said year, the Planning Board shall,
upon its initiative or upon the request of the organization
theretofore responsible for the maintenance of the common
open space, call a public hearing upon notice to such
organization, or to the residents and owners of the planned
unit development, to be held by the Planning Board, at which
hearing such organization or the residents and owners of the
planned unit development shall show cause why such
maintenance by the Township shall continue for a succeeding
year.
(d) If the Planning Board shall determine that such organization is
ready and able to maintain said common open space in a
reasonable condition, the Township shall cease to maintain
said common open space at the end of said year. If the Planning
Board shall determine that such organization is not ready and
able to maintain said common open space in a reasonable
condition, the Township may, at its discretion, continue to
maintain said common open space during the next succeeding
year and, subject to a similar hearing and determination, in
each year thereafter.
(e) The decision of the Planning Board in any such case shall
constitute a final administrative decision subject to judicial
review. The cost of such maintenance by the Township shall be
assessed ratably against the properties within the planned unit
development that have a right of enjoyment of the common
open space and shall become a tax lien on said properties.
(f) The Township, at the time of entering upon said common open
space for the purpose of maintenance, shall file a notice of such
lien in the office of the County Clerk upon the properties
affected by such lien within the planned unit development.

ARTICLE XXVI
Landscaping and Buffer Areas
[Amended 2-4-1985]
§ 205-106. General regulations.
A. Within a buffer area, a solid and continuous landscape screen shall be
planted and maintained. Said landscaping shall consist of lawn, massed
evergreen and deciduous trees and shrubs of such species and density
as will provide, within two growing seasons, a solid and continuous
screen throughout the full course of the year. The intense density of the
buffer screen may be reduced by the Planning Board if it is found that
the proposed use is visually attractive and not detrimental to the
appearance of the neighboring uses.
B. The entire buffer area and all required yard areas not occupied by
parking areas shall be graded and planted with grass seed or sod and
such shrubbery or trees as may be desired by the Planning Board. The
entire area shall be attractively maintained and kept free of all debris
and rubbish. In the event that any of the plantings in accordance with
this section do not live within the first year, they shall be immediately
replaced.
C. The required height for a landscape screen shall be measured in
relationship to the elevation of the land at the edge of the adjacent area
or structure to be buffered. In such cases as when the ground elevation
of the location at which the screen is to be planted is less than the
elevation of the edge of adjacent area to be buffered, the required
height of the screen shall be increased in an amount equal to the
difference in elevation. In the event that the ground elevation of the
location at which the screen is to be planted is greater than that at the
edge of the adjacent area to be buffered, the required height may be
reduced in an amount equal to said difference in elevation, provided
that in no case shall the required height be reduced to less than three
feet.
D. All nonpaved areas in commercial, industrial, public and semi-public
buildings and use areas shall be suitably landscaped with grass, trees,
shrubs and other landscaped materials.
E. When a parking area of four or more vehicles or a loading and
unloading area adjoins an adjacent residential property area, a
landscaped buffer screen shall be provided between the parking area
and the adjoining property. The buffer screen shall be no less than six
feet in height.
F. The buffer screen around parking lots and loading and unloading areas
may be constructed of wood or other fence material, provided that not
more than 25% of the fence is open on its vertical surface. In such
cases, evergreen and deciduous trees and shrubs shall be planted along
the fence to break up the monotony of the fence. Such landscaping may
§ 205-106 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-106
198:775
be omitted if it is the finding of the Planning Board that the type of
fence to be erected is visually attractive and not detrimental to the
appearance of surrounding areas.
G. If the Construction Official or Zoning Officer, upon inspection,
determines that the landscape materials, buffer areas and screens are
not being maintained in good condition, he shall notify the owner, in
writing, of his findings and order that any negligent maintenance on the
part of the owner be corrected within 30 days of the notice. In the event
that any planting required by this chapter fails to live, it shall be
replaced. If the owner fails to correct these conditions, after proper
notification by the Construction Official or the Zoning Officer, the
Mayor and Council may authorize correction of the condition by
authorizing the appropriate legal action.
H. The certificate of occupancy for the use on the premises shall not be
issued until such time as the landscaping requirements set forth in this
section are installed in accordance with the plan approved by the
Planning Board or until a performance bond is posted with the
Township in an amount equal to the estimated cost of said landscaping
installation. In any event, a performance bond shall be posted with the
Township in an amount equal to 50% of the total estimated cost to
ensure that the installed landscaping complies with the requirements
set forth at the completion of the second growing season.
I. Prior to commencing construction of any buildings, structures, railroad
tracks, driveways or parking areas, a permanent fence shall be
constructed along the entire length of any side or rear lot line that
abuts a residential zone or lot utilized for residential purposes in a
commercial or industrial zone. Such fence shall be a solid fence six feet
in height or an open fence eight feet in height and shall be of a type and
material approved by the Planning Board.
J. Unless the delineated buffer area shall contain such existing trees
either maintained at present grade or suitably welled so as to qualify to
meet the standards above, such buffer area shall be landscaped with
two rows of spruce trees or approved equal, with 10 feet between each
row. The trees in each row shall be 20 feet on centers. Each tree in one
row shall be 14 feet from any other tree in the other row so as to be
staggered in appearance. Each tree shall be a minimum of five feet in
height.

serve the needs and conveniences of the Township of North Brunswick
and, at the same time, recognizing that such uses may be or may
become inimical to the public health, safety and general welfare if
located and operated without proper consideration being given to
existing conditions and character of the surrounding area, such uses
are hereby designated as conditional uses. In addition to other powers
conferred by this chapter and applicable statutes, the Planning Board
shall have jurisdiction and power to approve conditional uses, under the
terms and conditions established by this chapter under the following
stipulations and guiding principles:

construction shall be in accordance with the applicable
requirements of the Standard Specifications. No excavated
material may be removed from the site except in accordance with
an approved final plat nor without the prior approval of the
Township Engineer. Where borrow excavation materials from offsite
sources are required to complete the necessary grading, such
material shall meet the requirements of the Standard
Specifications for Borrow Excavation Zone 3, and shall be subject
to the approval of the Township Engineer.
(2) Material which the Township Engineer judges is unsuitable for use
in roadway embankments may be used for grading outside the
roadway right-of-way of building areas with the permission of the
Township Engineer. Any unsuitable material which cannot be
satisfactorily utilized on the site shall be removed from the site and
disposed of at places to be provided by the subdivider.
(3) All construction layout and grading stakes shall be set by a licensed
land surveyor or professional engineer employed by the subdivider
or his contractor.
(4) All rough grading must be completed prior to the construction of
the roadway subgrade. All sidewalk areas and slope areas must be
fully graded prior to the construction of finished pavements or
pavement base courses.
D. Roadways.
(1) General requirements. Roadways and all appurtenances, including
subgrade, subbases, base courses and pavements, shall be
constructed in accordance with the applicable requirements of the
Standard Specifications as modified herein. All subsurface utilities
including service connections (terminating at least two feet behind

the sidewalk, or if no sidewalks are to be installed, terminating at
least seven feet behind the curb), to each lot and all storm drains
shall be installed in all roadway areas prior to the construction of
final pavement surfaces.
(2) Type of pavement. All roadways shall be constructed with either a
bituminous concrete flexible pavement structure or a portland
cement concrete rigid pavement structure. Only one type of
pavement shall be utilized throughout any subdivision.
(3) Pavement structure design.
(a) The pavement structure design for each particular subdivision
utilizing either a flexible or rigid pavement type shall be the
responsibility of the subdivider or his engineer. The pavement
design shall be based upon traffic loading projections and field
sampling and laboratory analysis of the subgrade soils to be
encountered in roadway areas in the subdivision and shall
follow current design recommendations of the Asphalt
Institute, the Portland Cement Concrete Association or such
other generally recognized standards as may be acceptable to
the Township Engineer.
(b) As minimum requirements, rigid Portland cement paving shall
be expansion joint type paving utilizing joints similar to Type A
expansion joints, according to the Standard Construction
Details of the New Jersey Department of Transportation, shall
be reinforced, constructed with Class B air-entrained concrete,
and shall have a minimum thickness of six inches for local and
minor collector streets and eight inches for other
classifications. Flexible bituminous concrete pavements shall
have an equivalent structural depth of at least eight inches of
bituminous concrete for local and minor collector streets,
having a minimum wearing surface of not less than two inches
of pavement Type FABC and a minimum bituminous stabilized
base course of not less than six inches. This required pavement
shall be a minimum requirement and may be modified or
increased by the Planning Board if required by soil, traffic
volumes or other conditions.
(4) Subgrades. All subgrade shall be prepared in accordance with the
applicable requirements of the Standard Specifications for
bituminous concrete and reinforced concrete pavements. Prior to
the construction of any subbase base of pavement course all salt or
unyielding portions of the subgrade which do not attain the
required stability will be removed and replaced with the suitable
material, and the whole surface of the subgrade shall be
compacted. The provision of a uniform roadway subgrade meeting
the requirements of the Standard Specifications shall be the full
responsibility of the subdivider. In certain cases, special treatment
may be required because of the character or nature of the subsoil.
§ 205-133.2 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-133.2
198:819
Such special treatment may include lime or cement stabilization,
wet excavation or construction of underdrainage fields. Any
proposal by the subdivider to stabilize subgrade shall be subject to
the approval of the Township Engineer.
(5) Subbase and/or aggregate base courses. Where granular subbase
courses are included in the pavement design section proposed by
the subdivider, they shall be constructed in accordance with the
applicable requirements of the Standard Specifications.
Bituminous concrete pavements and stabilized bases may be
constructed on subgrade without subbase or aggregate base
courses, provided that the subgrade can be satisfactorily prepared
as hereinbefore described. Dense graded aggregate base courses
shall comply with the requirements of the Standard Specifications
for soil aggregate Type 5, Class A, or Type 2, Class A or B. Portland
cement concrete pavements must be constructed with a minimum

base course (stone mix or gravel mix) in accordance with the
requirements of the Standard Specifications, except that the
requirements for the construction of base course shall be
amended to allow the laying of the base course with a single lift
maximum thickness not exceeding four inches.
(b) Prior to placement of any bituminous stabilized base coat, the
finished surface of any underlying subbase or aggregate base
shall receive a prime coat in accordance with the requirements
of the Standard Specifications.
(7) Bituminous pavements. Bituminous pavements shall consist of a
bituminous concrete surface course Type FABC 1 in accordance
with the requirements of the Standard Specifications. The
bituminous pavement wearing surface should generally not be
installed until just prior to the time the streets are prepared for
final acceptance. Prior to the installation of a bituminous concrete
surface, the bituminous base course shall be inspected by the
Township Engineer. Any areas of the base course in need of repair
shall be removed and replaced at the direction of the Township
Engineer. If the Township Engineer directs, a leveling course of
FABC material shall be placed on any uneven or below-grade base
courses prior to the placement of finished pavement. No pavement
surfaces shall be placed unless permission to do so has been
granted by the Township Engineer. No paving shall be done until all
§ 205-133.2 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-133.2
198:820
road structures, such as manholes, catch basins and other
underground utility access chambers, are brought to grade level.
(8) Concrete pavements. Concrete pavements shall be constructed in
accordance with the requirements of the Standard Specifications.
Expansion joints shall be New Jersey State Department of
Transportation Type A expansion joints. The subdivider may submit
at the time of submission of the tentative plat for preliminary
approval an alternate expansion joint detail. The use of such an
alternate must be recommended by the Township Engineer and
approved by the Planning Board. Where existing concrete
roadways are being widened as the result of abutting properties,
the widened pavement shall be required to be of portland cement
concrete. The remaining pavement in the subdivision may, if the
subdivider elects, be bituminous concrete. This will be an
exception. The requirement is that all pavement constructed within
a subdivision be of the type as specified in this section.
(9) Alternate pavement types. In areas where alternate pavement
types are proposed or desired for decorative purposes because of
physical restrictions on existing conditions or because of
limitations or shortages in certain types of construction materials,
a detail of the type and/or location of alternate pavement types
proposed shall be submitted for approval with the tentative and/or
final plat. The use of alternate pavement types may only be
permitted if the applicant submits for review and approval details
and specifications concerning the equipment, materials and
methods proposed for use and if the Township Engineer has
inspected the installation of and tested and approved a suitable
sample section of such pavement. In the event that the Township
Engineer does not approve the sample section of pavement, the
subdivider shall remove the same section and replace it with a type
of pavement permitted by this chapter or such other alternate as
may be approved by the Planning Board.
E. Curbs and gutters.
(1) General requirements. The Planning Board may require curbs and
gutters to be constructed along both sides of every street within a
subdivision. Any existing properties damaged by curb construction
shall be repaired to the standards herein and/or as shown on the
final plat. Where one side of the subdivision boundary shall be
constructed only on the subdivision side, curbs and/or
combinations of curb and gutter shall be constructed of concrete
having a twenty-eight-day compressive strength of 4,500 pounds
per square inch in accordance with the requirements of the
Standard Specifications. Preformed bituminous cellular-type joints
filled 1/2 inch thick and cut to match the cross section of the curb
shall be used at all expansion joints at intervals not greater than 20
feet. Intermediate plate joints shall be provided at intervals not
exceeding 10 feet. At places where the concrete curb shall be
§ 205-133.2 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-133.2
198:821
placed to match the paving joints, intermediate joints shall be
placed so as to create equal curb panels not longer than 20 feet.
When a concrete curb and gutter are required, the gutter shall be
eight inches thick and shall be constructed of concrete having a
twenty-eight-day compressive strength of 4,500 pounds per square
inch. Joints in the gutter shall be formed simultaneously with joints
in the curb. Curb and combination curb and gutter cross sections
shall be shown. The requirements of the Standard Specifications
regarding curing precautions must be strictly observed.
(2) Use of combination curb and gutter. Use of a combination curb and
gutter will be allowed in all areas and required in those areas
having a bituminous pavement with profile grade greater than 5%,
with the following exceptions:
(a) Both sides of a street for the entire block length shall be
constructed with one type of curb; that is, where only a portion
of a block is required to have a combination curb and gutter,
the entire block shall be constructed using the combination
curb and gutter.
(b) Where 50% or more of the curb length of any street would be
required to have a combination curb and gutter, the entire
street shall be constructed with the combination curb and
gutter.
(c) Where 50% or more of any subdivision is required to have a
combination curb and gutter, the entire subdivision shall be
constructed with a combination curb and gutter.
(3) Timing of curb construction. In areas with bituminous concrete
pavement, the required curb and/or curb and gutter shall be
constructed prior to the construction of the bituminous base
courses. Any required repairs to curbs and/or combination curbs
and gutters which are not suitable for acceptance shall be made
prior to construction of the final pavement wearing course. In those
areas having portland cement concrete pavement, the curb shall be
constructed after the construction and curing of the portland
cement concrete pavement.
(4) Alternate curb types. In certain instances it may be necessary or
desirable to construct alternate curb types. For example, these may
be required by the Planning Board on the perimeter of channelizing
islands or in areas of unusually heavy gutter drainage flow or may
be desired by the subdivider for decorative purposes or to preserve
vegetation, e.g., granite block curb, rolled concrete curb, etc. If
alternate curb types are to be permitted, an appropriate
construction detail shall be submitted for approval with the
tentative and final plat. A continuous slip-formed curb or a
combination curb and gutter may be permitted if such is
considered to be desirable by the Township Engineer. The use of a
§ 205-133.2 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-133.2
198:822
continuous slip-formed curb or a combination curb and gutter may
only be permitted if the applicant submits for review and approval
details and specifications concerning equipment, materials and
methods proposed for use, and if the Township Engineer has
inspected the installation of and tested and approved as suitable
a sample section of curb or combination curb and gutter, the
subdivider shall remove the sample section and replace it with a
type of curb or curb and gutter permitted by this chapter or such
other alternate as may be approved by the Planning Board.
F. Parking lots. Parking lots shall be constructed with a minimum of two
inches of fine aggregate bituminous concrete surface course and four
inches of bituminous stabilized base, unless otherwise approved by the
Planning Board with such other requirements as approved by the
Planning Board.
G. Sidewalks and aprons.
(1) General requirements. Sidewalks shall be constructed on both
sides of all streets within a subdivision and entirely around the
perimeter of all culs-de-sac. Where the subdivision abuts one side
of an existing street, the sidewalk shall be constructed only on that
side. Sidewalks shall also be constructed at any other places, such
as pedestrian walkways or access points to open space, as shown
on or required at the approval of the final plat.
(2) Location. Sidewalks shall generally be located within the roadway
right-of-way with the sidewalk edge farthest from the roadway
placed one foot from the property line. In cases where topography
dictates or a proposed subdivision provides for the extension of an
existing street or abuts an existing street, where sidewalks have
already been installed in a location other than as specified above,
or where such variations in sidewalk locations are needed to
preserve trees or natural features, the Planning Board may approve
alternate sidewalk locations in order to provide for the
preservation of physical features or the continuation of the existing
sidewalks.
(3) Sidewalk construction. Sidewalks shall be four feet wide and four
inches thick, except that when crossing driveways the thickness
shall be increased to six inches. Where the Planning Board
determines that a sidewalk may be subject to unusually heavy
pedestrian traffic, it may require that the width be increased to a
maximum of eight feet, except for two-way bike paths. All sidewalk
construction shall be in accordance with the applicable
requirements of the Standard Specifications. Concrete shall be
Class A, air-entrained. One-half-inch-thick preformed bituminous
cellular joint fillers shall be placed at intervals not exceeding 20
feet. Dummy (formed) joints shall be cut into the concrete sidewalk
between the expansion joints at equal intervals not exceeding the
width of the sidewalk. The sidewalk subgrade shall be compacted
§ 205-133.2 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-133.2
198:823
prior to the placement of any sidewalk. Any unsuitable material
encountered in the subgrade shall be removed and replaced with
suitable material acceptable to the Engineer. All six-inch sidewalk
areas crossing driveways shall be reinforced at the midpoint of
the sidewalk section. Reinforcement shall be welded wire fabric
(66-1212) or an equivalent approved by the Township Engineer.
(4) Apron construction. Reinforced concrete aprons shall be
constructed at all driveways between the concrete curb, or
combination curb and gutter, and the concrete sidewalk. Such
aprons shall be six inches thick and shall be reinforced with welded
wire fabric (66-1212) or an equivalent approved by the Township
Engineer located at the midpoint of the apron section. Concrete
shall be Class C, air-entrained. The width of the apron at the

building lots and in open space areas for public or quasi-public use,
the subdivider shall selectively thin to remove all dead or dying
vegetation, either standing or fallen, and shall remove, including
grubbing out stumps, all undesirable trees and other growth. The
subdivider shall, in accordance with overall site development and
his proposed landscaping scheme, provided cleared, graded and
drained pathways approximately four feet wide through all public
or quasi-public open space in heavily wooded areas. Such pathways
should be sited to conform to the existing natural conditions and
should remain unobtrusive. They are not intended to provide
improved walkways but only to provide easy access to open space.
(7) Additional trees. Besides the shade tree requirements outlined
above, additional trees shall be planted throughout the subdivision
in accordance with a planting plan approved by the Planning Board
at the time of final approval. The variety of plantings may vary from

public sewage disposal system, septic systems may be installed,
provided that:
(a) The requirements of state statutes, including the New Jersey
Realty Improvements Act, are met.
(b) They are installed in accordance with the regulations of the
North Brunswick Township Board of Health.153
(c) The lot use conforms to the requirements herein.
(d) If any existing land drainage structures, such as French drains,
are encountered during the course of construction of any
subdivision, no septic system or any part thereof shall be
installed on any lot within 400 feet thereof without the prior
approval of the Township of North Brunswick Board of Health.
Such approval shall only be granted if new percolation tests,
taken at least two months after such drainage structures are
removed, show that satisfactory soil conditions exist and that
installation of such septic system in the area affected by the
removal of the drainage structures will not be detrimental to
the health of the Township residents or cause pollution of any
of its waters.
N. Streetlighting. Streetlights shall be of a type approved by resolution of
the Township Council and by the electric utility company serving the
proposed subdivision. The subdivider shall pay the full cost for initial
installation of any streetlights. After final acceptance, operation and

proposed traffic control devices shall be in accordance with standards
prepared by the Township Engineer and approved by the Township
Council. [Amended 3-19-1990]
U. Inspection notice. All of the above-listed public improvements, except
those utility improvements which are not the responsibility of the
Township, shall be subject to an inspection and approval by the
Township Engineer, who shall be notified by the developer at least five
days prior to the initial start of construction and again 24 hours prior to
the resumption of work after any idle period exceeding one working
day. All of the utility improvements shall be subject to inspection and
approval by the owner or an agency controlling the utility, who shall be
notified by the developer in accordance with the utility's requirements.
No underground installation shall be covered until it is inspected and
approved by the owner of or agency controlling the facility for utilities
or by the Township Engineer in all other cases. [Amended 3-19-1990]
A. General requirements. Where the Planning Board determines that offtract
public improvements are necessary for proper development and
utilization of the proposed subdivision and the surrounding area, it may
require the subdivider to install or contribute to the installation of offtract
public improvements. Where the Planning Board has determined
that off-tract public improvements are required, the subdivider, prior to
the granting of final approval, shall have constructed or made payments
toward the ultimate installation of off-tract public improvements, such
as but not limited to streets, curb and gutters, sidewalks, water mains,
§ 205-133.2 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-133.3
198:831
sanitary sewers, storm sewers and culverts, monuments and
streetlights, all in accordance with the specifications governing on-site
public improvements. Required off-tract public improvements shall be
based upon adopted circulation plans and comprehensive utility plans
for the Township. [Amended 3-19-1990]
B. Cost allocation. The Planning Board shall allocate the cost of said offtract
public improvements in accordance with the standards
hereinafter set forth. The improvement of a stream and/or widening of a
street or road fronting on the tract to be subdivided shall not constitute
an off-tract public improvement, and the cost of said improvement shall
not be allocated. [Amended 3-19-1990]
(1) The allocation of cost for off-tract public improvements shall be
determined in accordance with the following:
(a) The Planning Board may consider the total cost of the off-tract
public improvements, the benefits conferred upon the
subdivision, the needs created by the subdivision population
and land use projections for the general areas of the
subdivision and other areas to be served by the off-tract public
improvements, the estimated times of construction of off-tract
public improvements and the condition and periods of
usefulness. The Planning Board may further consider the
criteria set forth below.
(b) Road, curb, gutter and sidewalk improvements may be based
upon the anticipated increase of traffic generated by the
subdivision. In determining such traffic increase, the Planning
Board may consider traffic counts, existing and projected
traffic patterns, quality of roads and sidewalks in the area and
the other factors related to the need created by the subdivision
and anticipated thereto.
(c) Drainage facilities may be based upon the percentage
relationship between the subdivision acreage and the acreage
of the total drainage basins involved or upon calculations
developing the percentage contribution that the storm runoff
from a particular subdivision bears to the total design capacity
of any public improvement, the particular methods to be
selected in each instance by the Township Engineer.
(d) Sewerage facilities shall be based upon a proportion as
determined by the current rules and regulations of the North
Brunswick Mayor and Council.
(e) Water supply and distribution facilities may be based upon the
current rules and regulations governing the particular utility
supplying water service.156

§ 205-133.4. Inspections; payment to contractors; acceptance of
public improvements.
(2) All moneys received by the Township in accordance with the
provisions of this section shall be paid to the Township Treasurer,
who shall provide for a suitable depository therefor. Such funds
shall be used only for the public improvements for which they are
deposited or public improvements serving the same purposes,
unless such public improvements are not initiated for a period of
five years from the date of payment, after which time said funds
shall be transferred to the capital improvement fund of the
Township.
(3) The apportionment of costs shall be determined by the Planning
Board. The subdivider shall be afforded an opportunity before said
Board to present evidence relative thereto.
C. Assessment not precluded. Nothing in this section shall preclude the
Township from assessing any property benefitting from installation of
any off-tract improvements as provided in this Article pursuant to the
provisions of the New Jersey Revised Statutes, allowance being made to
the respective parcels of realty for payments herein.
A. General requirements. All public improvements, except as otherwise
provided, shall be subject to inspection and approval by the Township
Engineer. No underground installation shall be covered until inspected
and approved by the Township Engineer or those agencies having
jurisdiction over the particular installation. If such installation is
covered prior to inspection, it shall be uncovered or other inspection
means used, such as television or other pipeline camera, as may be
deemed necessary by the Township Engineer, and charges for such
work will be paid by the subdivider. [Amended 3-19-1990]
B. Inspection not acceptance. Inspection of any work by the Township
Engineer or his authorized representative shall not be considered to be
final approval or rejection of the work, but shall only be considered to
be a determination of whether or not the specific work involved was
being done to Township specifications or other required standards at
the time of inspection. Any damage to such work or other unforeseen
circumstances, such as the effect of the weather, other construction,
changing conditions, settlement, etc., between the time of installation
and the time that the developer wishes to be released from his
performance guaranty, shall be the full responsibility of the developer,
and no work shall be considered accepted until release of the
performance guaranty.
C. Payment to contractors. No developer shall enter into any contract
requiring the Township Council, the Township Engineer or any of their
agents, employees or other representatives to make any declarations,
written or otherwise, as a condition of payment of said developer to a
contractor as to the acceptance or rejection of the work. Neither the
§ 205-133.3 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-133.4
198:833
Township Council, the Township Engineer nor any of their agents,
employees or representatives shall make any such declaration.
[Amended 3-19-1990]
D. Procedure on acceptance of public improvements. [Amended
4-7-1980; 3-19-1990]
(1) When the subdivider has constructed and installed the streets,
drainage facilities, curbs, sidewalks, street signs, monuments and
other improvements in accordance with Township regulations,
standards and specifications and desires the Township to accept
said public improvements, he shall notify the Township Council, in
writing, by certified mail addressed in care of the Township Clerk,
of the completion of said public improvements, with copies thereof
to the Township Engineer, requesting inspection of the public
improvements. The Township Engineer shall inspect the public
improvements as directed by the Township Council and shall file a
detailed written report indicating approval, partial approval or
rejection of the public improvements. The Township Engineer's
report may be filed subsequent to any public hearing which is held
concerning said public improvements pursuant to this section. The
Township Council shall notify the subdivider, in writing, by certified
mail, of the action to be taken not later than 45 days after receipt of
the Township Engineer's report that public improvements have
been completed. However, any request by the developer/subdivider
for postponement or adjournment of the decision to be made on the
release or reduction request, inspection or public hearing shall
eliminate the forty-five-day action requirement, and the developer
shall be required to renew his request thereafter. If the public
improvements have been constructed under a performance
guaranty after approval of a final plat, the subdivider shall submit
an as-built plan showing as-built grades, profiles and sections and
location of all subsurface utilities, such as French drains,
combination drains, sanitary sewage disposal systems, both public
and individual waterlines and control valves, gas lines, telephone
conduits, monuments, property iron markers and any other utilities
or public improvements which are constructed prior to final plat
approval, and the final plat shall reflect all changes and as-built
conditions and be so certified. Said as-build plan(s) shall be
submitted on reproducible media. [Amended 6-7-1993]
(2) Prior to any request for release or reduction of the performance
guaranty, the subdivider shall file the as-built plans with the
Township Engineer. The subdivider shall also submit digital vector
data of all bonded utilities associated with the project, in New
Jersey State Plane Coordinate System NAD83 in or compatible with
one of the following formats: AutoCAD drawing (DWG), ESRI
shapefile or Drawing Exchange (DXF) format. Thereafter the
subdivider/developer shall, in writing to the Township Clerk,
submit a request for release or reduction of the performance
§ 205-133.4 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-133.4
198:834
guaranty. The request shall state either the percentage of the
original performance guaranty amount sought to be reduced or
that complete release of the performance guaranty is requested.
In the event that the request is for a complete release of the
performance guaranty or for a reduction of the performance
guaranty which would result in 30% or less of the original
performance guaranty amount to remain in effect, the developer
shall determine from the Township Clerk the date when the
Township Council shall hold a public hearing on the release or
reduction of the performance guaranty, said date to be fixed during
the period within 45 days following the submission by the
developer of such as-built tracings and written request to the
Township Clerk. At least 10 days prior to the date fixed for said
hearing by the Township Clerk, the subdivider shall notify, by
certified mail or personal service, each property owner within the
development and shall cause to be advertised in the Township's
official newspaper a notice of the time and place of the hearing
during which the Township Council will consider the release of
the subdivider's performance bond. At least one week prior to said
hearing, the subdivider shall submit and file with the Township
Clerk a listing of all property owners within the development upon
whom notice was served; photostats or other acceptable
reproduction copies of all receipts for certified mail or an affidavit
stating that personal service was made and indicating the method
of personal service that was utilized; and proof in affidavit form
of publication in the Township's official newspaper. In the event
that the request is for a complete release of the performance
guaranty or for a reduction of the performance guaranty which
would result in 30% or less of the original performance guaranty
amount to remain in effect, the request shall be accompanied by
a certification of the developer/subdivider that all of the public
improvements covered under the performance guaranty have been
completed. Any such request not accompanied by the required
certification shall be rejected by the Township Clerk. [Amended
6-7-1993; 11-14-2005 by Ord. No. 05-34]
(3) The Township Council shall approve, partially approve or reject the
developer's request for release or reduction of the performance
guaranty based upon a determination as to whether those public
improvements coming within the scope of the performance
guaranty have been completed in accordance with the municipal
requirements which may be established by the various municipal
agencies having jurisdiction and in accordance with all
agreements, conditions of approval and other requirements of the
various municipal agencies having jurisdiction. The public
improvements generally included within the scope of the
performance guaranty constitute items as specifically enumerated
in the performance guaranty to be accepted by the Township.
Additional items which shall be included within the scope of the
performance guaranty are all nonpublic improvements whose
§ 205-133.4 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-133.4
198:835
operation may substantially affect or decrease the life of any and all
public improvements included within the scope of the performance
guaranty.
E. Procedure on release of performance bond for private site work
improvements. [Added 6-7-1993]
(1) When the subdivider has constructed and installed the private site
work improvements in accordance with Township regulations,
standards and specifications and desires the Township to accept
said private site work improvements, he shall notify the Township
Council, in writing, by certified mail addressed in care of the
Township Clerk, of the completion of said private site work
improvements, with copies thereof to the Township Engineer,
requesting inspection of the private site work improvements. The
Township Engineer shall then inspect the private site work
improvements as directed by the Township Council and shall file a
written report indicating whether the private site work
improvements have been installed, which report shall in part be
based upon the as-built drawing for subsurface utilities. The
Township Engineer's report may be filed subsequent to any public
hearing which is held concerning said private site work
improvements pursuant to this section. The Township Council shall
notify the subdivider, in writing, by certified mail, of the action to
be taken not later than 45 days after receipt of the Township
Engineer's report. However, any request by the developer/
subdivider for postponement or adjournment of the decision to be
made on the release or reduction request, inspection or public
hearing shall eliminate the forty-five-day action requirement, and
the developer shall be required to renew his request thereafter.
Said as-built plans shall be certified to by the applicant's
professional engineer. Said as-built plan(s) shall be submitted on
reproducible media.
(2) Prior to any request for release of the private site work
performance guaranty, the subdivider shall file the as-built plans
with the Township Engineer. The subdivider shall also submit
digital vector data of all bonded utilities associated with the
project, in New Jersey State Plane Coordinate System NAD83 in or
compatible with one of the following formats: AutoCAD drawing
(DWG), ESRI shapefile or Drawing Exchange (DXF) format.
Thereafter the subdivider/developer shall, in writing to the
Township Clerk, submit a request for release or reduction of the
performance guaranty. The developer shall determine from the
Township Clerk the date when the Township Council shall hold a
public hearing on the release or reduction of the performance
guaranty, said date to be fixed during the period within 45 days
following the submission by the developer of such as-built tracings
and written request to the Township Clerk. At least 10 days prior to
the date fixed for said hearing by the Township Clerk, the

subdivider shall notify, by certified mail or personal service, each
property owner within the development and shall cause to be
advertised in the Township's official newspaper a notice of the
time and place of the hearing during which the Township Council
will consider the release of the subdivider's private site work
performance bond. At least one week prior to said hearing, the
subdivider shall submit and file with the Township Clerk a listing
of all property owners within the development upon whom notice
was served; photostats or other acceptable reproduction copies of
all receipts for certified mail or an affidavit stating that personal
service was made and indicating the method of personal service
that was utilized; and proof in affidavit form of publication in the
Township's official newspaper. [Amended 11-14-2005 by Ord.
No. 05-34]
(3) The Township Council shall approve or reject the developer's
request for release or reduction of the performance guaranty based
upon determination as to whether those private site work
improvements coming within the scope of the performance
guaranty have been completed in accordance with the municipal
requirements which may be established by the various municipal
agencies having jurisdiction and in accordance with all
agreements, conditions of approval and other requirements of the
various municipal agencies having jurisdiction. The private site
work improvements generally included within the scope of the
performance guaranty constitute items as specifically enumerated
in the performance guaranty to be accepted by the Township.
A. (Reserved)157
B. Modification of public improvements. At any time, whether as a result
of his inspection of work underway or otherwise, the Township
Engineer may recommend that the subdivider be required to modify the
design and extent of the public improvements required, notifying the
Planning Board of his recommendations. The Planning Board shall, if it
considers such modifications to be major or if requested by the
subdivider or the Township Engineer, take formal action to approve or
disapprove such recommendations; provided, however, that it must first
afford the subdivider an opportunity to be heard. If the Board takes no
formal action within 30 days of such recommendations, or where the
subdivider has not requested formal Planning Board action, its approval
will be assumed. Similarly, the Planning Board may grant or deny the
subdivider permission to effect such modification upon his application
and the Township Engineer's approval. In either event, where such
modification is to be effected, the appropriate subdivision map or plat

A. Before recording final subdivision plats or recording of minor
subdivision deeds or as a condition of a final site plan approval or as a
condition to the issuance of a zoning permit pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-65, the Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment may
require and shall accept, in accordance with the standards adopted
herein, for the purpose of assuring the installation and maintenance of
certain on-tract public improvements:
(1) Performance guaranty required.
(a) The furnishing of a performance guaranty in favor of the
Township of North Brunswick in an amount equal to 120% of
the cost of only those improvements required by an approval or
developer's agreement, ordinance, or regulation to be
dedicated to a public entity, and that have not yet been
installed, which cost shall be determined by the developer and
approved by the Municipal Engineer, according to the method
of calculation set forth in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4, for the
following improvements as shown on the approved plans or
plat: streets, pavement, gutters, curbs, sidewalks, street
lighting, street trees, surveyor's monuments, as shown on the
final map and required by the Map Filing Law, P.L. 1960, c.
141,158 water mains, sanitary sewers, community septic
systems, drainage structures, public improvements of open
space, and any grading necessitated by the preceding
improvements.
(b) The performance guaranty may also be required to include, at
the discretion of the Township, Planning Board or Zoning
Board of Adjustment, a guaranty for the installation of
privately owned perimeter buffer landscaping. A separate
performance guaranty, if required, shall be posted for the
privately owned perimeter buffer landscaping or may be
included in the performance guaranty for the bonded public
improvements. The developer shall prepare an itemized cost
estimate of the improvements covered by the performance
guaranty for review and approval by the Municipal Engineer,
which improvements shall be appended to each performance
guaranty posted by the obligor. The developer shall also submit
digital vector data of all bonded as-built utilities associated
158. Editor's Note: See N.J.S.A. 46:26B-1 et seq.
§ 205-133.5 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-133.6

with the project, in New Jersey State Plane Coordinate System
NAD83 in or compatible with one of the following formats:
AutoCAD drawing (DWG), ESRI shapefile or Drawing
Exchange (DXF) format.
(2) The developer shall post with the Township, prior to the release of
the performance guaranty, a maintenance guaranty in an amount
equal to 15% of the cost of the installation of the improvements
covered under the performance guaranty, along with the following
private site improvements: stormwater management basins, inflow
and water quality structures within the basins, and the outflow
pipes and structures of the stormwater management system, if any,
which itemized cost shall be determined by the developer and
approved by the Municipal Engineer according to the method of
calculation set forth in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4. The term of the
maintenance guaranty shall be for a period not to exceed two years
and shall automatically expire at the end of the established term.
(3) The furnishing of a safety and stabilization guaranty in favor of the
Township of North Brunswick to ensure that the Township has an
adequate guaranty to return the property that has been disturbed
to a safe and stable condition or otherwise implement measures to
protect the public from access to an unsafe or unstable condition.
The Township shall be permitted to access the guaranty when site
disturbance has commenced and, thereafter, all work on the
development has ceased for a period of at least 60 consecutive days
following such commencement for reasons other than force
majeure, and work has not recommenced within 30 days following
the provision of written notice by the Township to the developer of
the Township's intent to claim payment under the guaranty. At the
developer's option, the safety and stabilization guaranty may be
included as a line item for safety and stabilization in the
performance guaranty rather than in the form of a separate
guaranty. The amount of the safety and stabilization guaranty shall
be calculated pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4 as follows:
(a) $5,000 for the first $100,000 of bonded improvement costs;
plus
(b) 2.5% of bonded improvement costs in excess of $100,000 up to
$1,000,000; plus
(c) 1% of bonded improvement costs in excess of $1,000,000.
B. The time allowed for installation of the bonded improvements for which
the performance guaranty has been provided may be extended by the
governing body by resolution. As a condition or part of any such
extension, the amount of any performance guaranty shall be increased
or reduced, as the case may be, to an amount not to exceed 120% of the
cost of the installation as determined by the developer and approved by
§ 205-133.6 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-133.6
198:839
the Municipal Engineer according to the method of calculation set forth
in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4 as of the time of the passage of the resolution.
C. If the required bonded improvements are not completed or corrected in
accordance with the performance guaranty, the obligor and surety, if
any, shall be liable thereon to the Township for the reasonable cost of
the improvements not completed or corrected, and the Township may,
either prior to or after the receipt of the proceeds thereof, complete
such improvements.
D. Approved bonded improvements.
(1) Upon substantial completion of all required street improvements
(except for the top course) and appurtenant utility improvements
and the connection of same to the public system, the obligor may
notify the governing body, in writing, by certified mail addressed in
care of the Municipal Clerk, of the completion or substantial
completion of bonded improvements and shall send a copy thereof
to the Municipal Engineer. The request shall indicate which bonded
improvements have been completed and which bonded
improvements remain uncompleted in the judgment of the obligor.
Thereupon, the Municipal Engineer shall inspect all bonded
improvements of which such notice has been given and shall file a
detailed report, in writing, with the governing body, indicating
either approval, partial approval or rejection of such improvements
with a statement of reasons for any rejection. The cost of the
improvements as approved or rejected shall be set forth.
(2) The governing body, by resolution, shall either approve the bonded
improvements determined to be complete and satisfactory by the
Municipal Engineer or reject any or all of these bonded
improvements upon the establishment in the resolution of cause for
rejection and shall approve and authorize the amount of reduction
to be made in the performance guaranty relating to the
improvements accepted, in accordance with the itemized cost
estimate prepared by the Municipal Engineer and appended to the
performance guaranty. This resolution shall be adopted not later
than 45 days after receipt of the list and report prepared by the
Municipal Engineer. Upon adoption of the resolution by the
governing body, the obligor shall be released from all liability
pursuant to its performance guaranty with respect to those
approved bonded improvements, except for that portion adequately
sufficient to secure completion or correction of the improvements
not yet approved, provided that 30% of the amount of the total
performance guaranty and safety and stabilization guaranty posted
may be retained to ensure completion and acceptability of all
improvements. The safety and stabilization guaranty shall be
reduced by the same percentage as the performance guaranty is
being reduced at the time of each performance guaranty reduction.
§ 205-133.6 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-133.6
198:840
(3) For the purpose of releasing the obligor from liability pursuant to
its performance guaranty, the amount of the performance guaranty
attributable to each approved bonded improvement shall be
reduced by the total amount for each such improvement, in
accordance with the itemized cost estimate which formed the basis
of the performance guaranty and appended to the performance
guaranty pursuant to Subsection A of this section, including any
contingency factor applied to the cost of installation. If the sum of
the approved bonded improvements would exceed 70% of the total
amount of the performance guaranty, then the municipality may
retain 30% of the amount of the total performance guaranty and
safety and stabilization guaranty to ensure completion and
acceptability of bonded improvements, as provided above, except
that any amount of the performance guaranty attributable to
bonded improvements for which a temporary certificate of
occupancy guaranty has been posted shall be released from the
performance guaranty even if such release would reduce the
amount held by the municipality below 30%.
E. If any portion of the required improvements is rejected, the approving
authority may require the obligor to complete such improvements, and
upon completion, the same procedure of notification as set forth in this
section shall be followed.
F. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed to limit the right of the
obligor to contest by legal proceedings any determination of the
governing body or the Municipal Engineer.
G. Inspection fees.
(1) The obligor shall reimburse the municipality for reasonable
inspection fees paid to the Municipal Engineer for the foregoing
inspection of the improvements, which fees shall not exceed the
sum of the amount set forth in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53. The municipality
may require the developer to post the inspection fees in escrow in
an amount calculated as follows: except for extraordinary
circumstances, the greater of $500 or 5% of the cost of
improvements subject to a performance guaranty, plus an amount
not to exceed 5% of the cost of private site improvements not
subject to a performance guaranty, which cost shall be determined
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4. If the inspection fees required are
less than $10,000, the developer shall have the option of paying
same in two equal installments with the initial amount deposited to
be 50% of the inspection fees. When the balance of inspections fees
on deposit reaches 10%, the remaining installment shall be due and
payable. If the inspection fees required are $10,000 or greater, the
developer shall have the option of paying same in up to four
installments with the initial amount deposited to be 25% of the
inspection fees. When the balance of inspection fees on deposit
reaches 10%, the developer shall make additional deposits of 25%
of the inspection fees.
§ 205-133.6 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-133.6
198:841
(2) If the Township determines that the amount in escrow for the
payment of inspection fees, as calculated herein, is insufficient to
cover the cost of additional required inspections, the Township may
require the developer to deposit additional funds in escrow,
provided that the Township delivers to the developer a written
inspection escrow deposit request, prepared by the Municipal
Engineer, which informs the developer of the need for additional
inspections, details the items or undertakings that require
inspection, estimates the time required for those inspections, and
estimates the cost of performing those inspections.
(3) In the event that final approval is by stages or sections of
development pursuant to Subsection (a) of Section 29 of the
Municipal Land Use Law (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-38), the provisions of this
section shall be applied by stage or section.
H. Temporary certificate of occupancy guaranty.
(1) In the event that the developer shall seek a temporary certificate of
occupancy for a development, unit, lot, building, or phase of
development, as a condition of the issuance thereof, the developer
shall furnish a separate guaranty, referred to herein as a
"temporary certificate of occupancy guaranty," in favor of the
Township of North Brunswick in an amount equal to 120% of the
cost of installation of only those improvements or items which
remain to be completed or installed under the terms of the
temporary certificate of occupancy and which are required to be
installed or completed as a condition precedent to the issuance of
the permanent certificate of occupancy for the development, unit,
lot, building or phase of development and which are not covered by
an existing performance guaranty. Upon posting of a temporary
certificate of occupancy guaranty, all sums remaining under a
performance guaranty, required pursuant to § 205-133.6 of the
North Brunswick Code, which relate to the development, unit, lot,
building, or phase of development for which the temporary
certificate of occupancy is sought, shall be released.
(2) The scope and amount of the temporary certificate of occupancy
guaranty shall be determined by the Construction Code Official,
Zoning Officer, Municipal Engineer, or any other municipal official
designated by ordinance. The temporary certificate of occupancy
guaranty shall be released by the Construction Code Official,
Zoning Officer, Municipal Engineer, or other municipal official
designated by ordinance upon the issuance of a permanent
certificate of occupancy with regard to the development, unit, lot,
building, or phase as to which the temporary certificate of
occupancy relates.
I. If the property or any part of same is sold, or otherwise conveyed to a
successor developer prior to the completion and acceptance of all
improvements, an assignment of developer's agreement and new

performance, maintenance or other guaranties shall be required from
the new owner or successor developer. Upon the transfer of ownership
of property that is the subject of a construction permit, and prior to
beginning or continuing work authorized by the construction permit,
the new owner or successor developer shall file with the Building
Department an application for a permit update to notify the Building
Department of the name and address of the new owner or successor
developer and of all other changes to information previously submitted
to the Building Department. The Building Department shall not approve
the application for a permit update until it receives notification from
the governing body, or its designee, that the new owner or successor
developer has furnished adequate replacement performance,
maintenance or other guaranties and assignment of developer's
agreement.
A. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to maintain the entire
subdivision in a safe and orderly condition during construction.
Necessary steps shall be taken by the subdivider to protect occupants
of the subdivision and the general public from hazardous and unsightly
conditions during the entire construction period. These steps shall
include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) Open excavation shall be enclosed by fencing or barricades during
nonconstruction hours. Movable barricades shall be equipped with
yellow flashing hazard markers or other lighting during hours of
darkness.
(2) Excavation of previously installed sidewalk and pavement areas
which provide access to occupied buildings in the subdivision shall
be clearly marked with signs and barricades. Alternate safe access
shall be provided for pedestrians and vehicles to the occupied
buildings.
(3) Materials stored on the site shall be screened from the view of
occupants of the subdivision and adjoining streets and properties.
(4) Construction equipment, materials and trucks shall not be stored
within 150 feet of occupied buildings in the subdivision and
adjoining streets and properties during nonconstruction hours.
(5) Safe vehicular and pedestrian access to occupied buildings in the
subdivision shall be provided at all times.

adjoining properties and streets shall not be permitted.
(7) Construction activities which will result in damage to trees and
landscaping on occupied lots in the subdivision or adjoining
properties shall not be permitted.
(8) All locations and activities in the subdivision which present
potential hazards shall be marked with signs indicating the
potential hazard.
(9) Unsightly construction debris, including scrap materials, cartons,
boxes and wrappings must be removed daily at the end of each
working day.
(10) Construction traffic control devices shall be provided in
accordance with the Uniform Manual of Traffic Control Service,
with any subsequent addendum, as approved by the New Jersey
Department of Transportation.
(11) Snow shall be removed from all streets and roadways not yet
accepted by the Township but used by residents of the development
within 12 hours after daylight after any such street or roadway is
covered with snow or ice, and if same cannot be wholly removed
from such streets and roadways, sand, salt or other proper
substance shall be sprinkled thereon so that such street or roadway
shall be safe for travel. This obligation shall commence upon the
first occupancy of the development. [Added 5-5-2003 by Ord. No.

B. Should the developer fail in his obligation to maintain the subdivision in
a safe and orderly condition, the Township may, on two days' written
notice, or immediately in the case of hazard to life, health, or property,
undertake whatever work may be necessary to return the subdivision to
a safe and orderly condition. The cost thereof shall be charged against
the performance guaranty.
A. Before any subdivider transfers or assigns any of his interest in any
tentative or final approval of any subdivision, he must notify the
Township Council and supply detailed information with regard to the
name, address, principals, type of organization, competency,
experience and past performance of the assignee, transferee or agent.
Notice of such assignment or transfer shall be given at least 10 days
prior to its effective date, and the assignee must be made acquainted
with all the conditions of approval, and the subdivider shall so certify.
B. No contractor, builder, developer or subcontractor shall engage any
personnel in any of the work on constructing any public improvements

on the site of the subdivision unless they are continually supervised by
a competent supervisor acceptable to the Township Engineer.
C. Not less than five days prior to commencing construction of any public
improvements on the site, the subdivider or his agent shall provide the
Township Engineer with the names, addresses, phone numbers and
emergency phone numbers of the subdivider and/or a representative
empowered to act for the subdivider and of each contractor and the
supervisor in charge of the construction, setting forth the aspect of
construction for which each is responsible.

ARTICLE XXXIII
Subdivision Design Standards; Miscellaneous Requirements
§ 205-134. General standards; waiver of requirements.
A. Responsibility for design. Within the criteria established by and subject
to the review and approval of the Planning Board, all design of a
subdivision is the responsibility of the subdivider, and he shall be
responsible for and bear the entire cost of any and all investigations,
tests, reports, surveys, samples, calculations, environmental
assessments, designs, researches or any other activity necessary to the
completion of the subdivision design. The standards set in this Article
shall be taken to be the minimum necessary to meet its purposes as set
forth elsewhere herein. The responsibility of the Planning Board shall
be to see that these minimum standards are followed and, in those
cases not covered by these standards, that sufficient precautions are
taken to assure that the eventual subdivision design is conducive to the
implementation of the purposes of this chapter. The Planning Board
may employ professionals in various disciplines to advise and assist it in
its determinations. Any decision of the Planning Board regarding the
suitability or sufficiency of any design proposal, taken upon advice of its
professionals and subject to the provisions of this Article, shall be
deemed conclusive.
B. Design data. To properly execute the design of a subdivision, it is
anticipated that the subdivider will obtain or cause to be obtained
certain design data, including but not limited to soil tests and analyses,
environmental assessments, traffic studies and traffic projections,
surveys, reports and similar design data. Any and all such data obtained
by the subdivider, or by others retained by him to complete the design
of the subdivision, shall be made available to the Planning Board and its
employees and professional staff for the purposes of reviewing the
proposed subdivision design. Should the Planning Board feel the design
data submitted is not sufficient for the purpose of completing a full
review of the subdivision proposal, it may request the applicant to
provide such additional information as is deemed necessary. Until the
applicant supplies such information, no submission under the
provisions of this section shall be termed complete. Nothing contained
herein shall be interpreted to prevent the Planning Board from making
or causing to be made such independent studies, calculations or other
undertakings as it deems necessary in the review of any proposal.
C. Design standards. When a subdivider determines that it will be
necessary to utilize design standards in addition to or other than those
minimum requirements established herein, he is advised to consult with
the Township Engineer prior to beginning his detailed design, for
review and approval of his proposed design standards. Standards
utilized should generally be nationally recognized and in common use in
this area. Design standards may not be utilized if they do not have the
approval of the Township Engineer.
§ 205-134 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-134
198:847
§ 205-134.1. Streets and roadways.
D. Waiver of requirements. It is recognized that, in certain instances,
preexisting conditions or the uniqueness of a particular proposal may
require the waiver of some of the standards presented herein. The
Planning Board may consider and, for cause shown, may waive strict
conformance to such of these detailed design standards as it sees fit.
Any subdivider desiring such action shall present with his application
for final approval a listing of all such waivers desired together with the
reasons therefor.
A. Street extensions. The arrangement of streets within the subdivision
shall provide for the extension and/or realignment of existing major
arterial highways, major thoroughfares and collector streets.
Arrangements should be made to extend existing minor streets only
when such extension is necessary and the Planning Board concurs that
such extension will promote safety and conform to the minor street
standards contained in this section.
B. Street widening. Where subdivisions abut existing roadways, sufficient
right-of-way shall be reserved to provide the right-of-way width
proposed for the functional classification of the street in question.
C. Design of local streets. Local streets shall be designed in accordance
with the schedule of street design standards and the following
requirements:
(1) Local streets shall be so arranged that there exists a minimum
possibility of their use by traffic which does not have its origin or
destination at the lots to which the local streets provide access.
(2) Culs-de-sac (dead-end streets) may be used where necessary, but
should not have a center-line length from the intersecting street
center line to the center point of the cul-de-sac of less than 100 feet
nor longer than 1,200 feet. They shall provide an end turnaround
with a pavement radius of not less than 50 feet, which shall have its
center point at or to the left of the center line of the street, when
viewed toward the closed end. In the event that it is contemplated
that a dead-end street shall be extended in the future, a temporary
cul-de-sac meeting the aforementioned design criteria shall be
required.
(3) When their use is possible, short loop streets are preferred to culsde-
sac. Loop streets shall have both of their terminuses located on
the same major street to be so classified.
(4) P-loops, which are loop streets with a single access point, should
have an entrance not exceeding 700 feet in distance from the loop
intersection. There should also be provided an emergency
vehicular and pedestrian right-of-way of 15 feet, minimum width,
from the loop and providing access to a street which is not a part of
§ 205-134 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-134.1
198:848
the P-loop. The loop of a P-loop should have a street length not
exceeding 3,000 feet. The entrance street of P-loops should be
designed in accordance with the design standards for minor
collector streets.
(5) Artificial modifications in street rights-of-way for the purpose of
increasing lot frontage shall be prohibited. Such prohibited
modifications shall include but not be limited to widening the rightof-
way of a continuous street through the use of semi-circular
projections.
(6) One-way streets. When a loop street provides access to 25 or fewer
lots and topographical conditions provide for difficult construction,
the Planning Board may consider the use of a one-way street and a
reduced paving width in accordance with the schedule of street
design standards. The Planning Board may also consider the use of
one-way streets and reduced paving width where, by reason of
topography, physical features or other conditions, reduced width
would substantially reduce disruption of the subdivision's
environment. Such one-way streets and reduced paving width are
subject to the review and approval of the Traffic Bureau of the New
Jersey Department of Transportation. Such review and approval
must be obtained by the subdivider before tentative approval of a
preliminary plat will be granted.
D. Classification of streets.
(1) In any subdivision it shall be the duty of the Planning Board to
approve classification of proposed streets according to their use. In
making its decisions, the Planning Board shall refer to the Master
Plan and shall consider conditions within the subdivision and the
surrounding areas and shall use as a guide the following street
classifications and criteria:
LOCAL STREET  A street providing access to abutting properties
and, where feasible, should be either a cul-de-sac or a loop street
meeting the requirements hereinabove set forth. A street which
serves traffic having origins and destinations other than within the
lots which abut the street shall not be considered a local street.
MINOR COLLECTOR STREET  Generally a street gathering
traffic from local streets and feeding it into a system of major
collectors, major thoroughfares or major arterial roadways and
could be utilized by traffic other than residential in nature.
MAJOR COLLECTOR STREET  Generally a street gathering
traffic from local streets or minor collector streets and feeding
it into a system of major thoroughfares or arterial highways and
could be utilized by traffic other than residential in nature.
MAJOR THOROUGHFARE  A street gathering traffic from more
than one minor or major collector and leading it to a system of
other major thoroughfares or major arterial streets.
§ 205-134.1 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-134.1
198:849
MAJOR ARTERIAL HIGHWAY  Any federal, state or county
highway or Township street or road intended to carry traffic
between other major arterials and major thoroughfares and
between the various neighborhoods of the Township or from the
Township's neighborhoods to destinations outside the Township.
(2) Classification criteria. Street classifications will be approved by the
Planning Board in accordance with the foregoing definitions, in
accordance with the provisions of the Master Plan and Official Map
if such are adopted, in accordance with the provisions of applicable
county and state regulations or plans or, in the absence of specific
information, from the above, in accordance with its own best
judgment concerning the use to which the various streets in any
subdivision will be put.
E. Lots abutting major collector streets, major thoroughfares and arterial
highways. In any subdivision abutting or being traversed by a major
collector street, major thoroughfare or major arterial highway, one of
the following conditions shall be required by the Board:
(1) A marginal street meeting the classifications herein for a local
street shall be provided along each major collector, major
thoroughfare or major arterial highway and shall be separated
from the major collector, major thoroughfare or arterial highway by
a landscaped strip at least 25 feet in width.
(2) The frontage of all lots abutting the major collector, major
thoroughfare or major arterial highway shall be reversed so that
the lots will front on an internal local street. A natural wooded or
landscaped buffer strip at least 50 feet in width will be provided on
the abutting lots along the right-of-way of the major collector, major
thoroughfare or major arterial highway. The area of such buffer
strip shall not be considered part of the required minimum lot size.
(3) All lots abutting major collector streets may, in lieu of the above, be
provided with suitable driveway turnarounds eliminating any
necessity for vehicles to back into a collector street [or may be
designed as in Subsection E(1) or (2) above].
(4) Other means of providing a satisfactory buffer separating through
and local traffic shall be provided as may be deemed proper by the
Planning Board.
(5) Dwellings on corner lots shall be diagonally oriented or shall have
their driveway access on the roadway designed and intended to
carry the lesser amount of traffic.
F. Street design standards. Street design standards shall be appropriate
to the expected use of the street, soil, topographical and other physical
conditions and to the maintenance of the purposes of this section, but
shall not be less than those set forth in the Schedule of Street Design
Standards contained herein.

9 When dissimilar streets interest, the larger radius will be used.
G. Street intersections. Street intersections shall be designed according to
the following standards:
(1) No more than two streets shall cross the same point. Street
intersections shall be at right angles wherever possible, and
intersections of less than 70° (measured at the center line of
streets) shall not be permitted.
(2) Streets should not enter the same side of major collector streets at
intervals of less than 500 feet, major thoroughfares at intervals of
less than 1,200 feet or arterials at intervals of less than 2,500 feet.
Streets which enter collectors, major thoroughfares or major
arterials from opposite sides shall be directly opposite to each
other or must be separated by at least 150 feet between their
center lines measured along the center line of an intersected
collector or 500 feet along the center line of a major thoroughfare
or 800 feet along the center line of a major arterial.
(3) Approaches of any major collector, major thoroughfare, or major
arterial street shall be tangent or have a center-line radius greater
than 5,000 feet for at least 500 feet from the intersection.
(4) Where a minor or major collector, major thoroughfare or major
arterial street intersect, the right-of-way of each minor collector
shall be widened by 10 feet (five feet on each side) for a distance of
300 feet in all directions from the intersection of the center lines,
and the right-of-way of each major collector, major thoroughfare
and major arterial shall be widened by 20 feet (10 feet on each
side) for 500 feet in all directions from the intersection of the
center lines.
(5) Approaches of any local or minor collector street to any other street
shall be tangent (straight) for a distance of at least 50 feet from the
intersection or have a center-line radius greater than 1,000 feet for
at least 150 feet from the intersection and have a clear sight of a
point three feet high in the intersection for a distance of not less
than 400 feet.
§ 205-134.1 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-134.1
198:853
H. Street layout.
(1) Curved local and minor collector streets are preferred to
discourage speed and monotony. The maximum straight line
distance should not exceed 1,000 feet.
(2) In all cases the Planning Board may, and in the case of subdivisions
having 100 or more lots the Planning Board shall, require provision
for continuing circulation patterns onto adjacent properties and,
for this purpose, may require the provision of stub streets abutting
adjacent properties.
(3) Subdivisions containing more than 150 lots should have two access
points from collector streets, major thoroughfares or arterial
highways.
I. Grading for roadways. To preserve the integrity of pavements,
embankments and excavations for streets or roadways shall be
provided with slopes no steeper than one foot vertical rise for every
three feet of horizontal distance. Such slopes shall be suitably planted
with perennial grasses or other ground cover plantings in accordance
with the plans approved by the Planning Board. In areas where
excavations or embankments would extend significantly beyond road
rights-of-way, thereby causing disruption to the natural environment of
the subdivision, the Planning Board may, upon the application of the
subdivider, consider or may, upon its own initiative, direct the use of
terraces, retaining walls, crib walls or other means of maintaining
roadway slopes. In any event, the entire roadway right-of-way shall be
fully graded, and any retaining walls, crib walls or terraces shall be
located out of the right-of-way, and maintenance shall be the
responsibility of the owner of the property on which they are
constructed. The subdivider shall make suitable provisions in the
instruments transferring title to any property containing such terraces,
retaining walls or crib walls and shall provide a copy thereof to the
Planning Board. All graded areas within or outside of the roadway rightof-
way shall be neatly graded, topsoiled and fertilized and seeded, to
establish a stand of perennial grasses. Top of slopes in excavations and
top of slopes in embankment areas shall coincide with the right-of-way
line or the exterior line of the five-foot-wide shade tree and utility
easement required herein. Sidewalk and easement areas shall slope at
2% to the top of curb elevation, and sidewalk construction shall
conform to this slope.
J. Limit of improvements. The subdivider shall complete all improvements
to the limits of the subdivision, unless other provisions have been made
and approved by the Planning Board. In those instances where
completion of certain improvements would not be possible until the
development of adjacent land takes place, alternate temporary
improvements may be constructed subject to the approval of the
Planning Board, and cash or a certified check representing the
difference between the value of the temporary improvements and the
§ 205-134.1 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-134.1
198:854
§ 205-134.2. Drainage facilities.
required improvements may be accepted by the Mayor and Council to
be credited toward the completion of such improvements at such time
as the adjacent land develops.
K. Streets serving other than single-family detached homes. The right-ofway
width and other standards for internal roads and alleys in
multifamily commercial and industrial subdivisions shall be determined
by the Board on an individual basis and shall in all cases be at sufficient
width and design to safely accommodate maximum traffic, parking and
loading needs and maximum access for fire-fighting equipment and
shall generally conform to the requirements herein.
L. Reserve strips. There shall be no reserve strips or areas controlling
access to streets except where control and disposal of the land
comprising such strips or areas have been placed in the hands of the
Mayor and Council under conditions approved by the Planning Board.
A. Layout of storm sewer system.
(1) Inlet spacing shall not exceed 600 feet or a design inlet flow of 4.0
cubic feet per second for Type B inlets and 1.5 cubic feet per
second for Type E inlets, and, in addition, gutter flow shall also be
limited to provide a maximum gutter flow surface width of nine feet
for local and minor collector streets, six feet for major collector
streets and shall be retained within the shoulder areas on all major
thoroughfares and major arterials.
(2) Gutter flow across intersections will not be allowed. Sufficient
inlets will be placed to prevent flow across intersections. No swales
or dish gutters will be permitted. Sewers shall be tangent between
junctions. Manholes shall be placed at all sewer junctions where
inlets are not required and at maximum intervals of 600 feet in
continuous drainage runs.
B. Type of inlets. All street inlets shall be New Jersey Department of
Transportation Standard Type B; and all yard inlets shall be Standard
Type E. Casting heights on street inlets shall be two inches greater than
the specified curbface.
C. Open channels.
(1) Open channels shall be designed to contain the required flow and
shall have a design velocity low enough in the judgment of the
Township Engineer to prevent erosion. The minimum easement for
open channel sections shall be the maximum design top width of
the channel section segment plus 25 feet rounded to the next
highest five-foot increment. The excess easement area shall be
provided offset to that side of the channel most convenient for use
by maintenance crews; and the minimum distance between the
channel top edge and any easement line shall be five feet. Excess
§ 205-134.1 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-134.2
198:855
velocity, if any, as determined by the Township Engineer, in open
channels must be controlled by sod, riprap, paving, ditch checks
or other suitable methods. Changes of direction in open channels
must have a minimum radius of 800 feet or be adequately paved or
riprapped.
(2) Generally, unlined open channel cross sections shall have side
slopes not steeper than four to one for channel depths of two feet or
less and not steeper than six to one for channel depths of more than
two feet. Lined open channel side slopes shall not be steeper than
two to one.
(3) The bottoms of all unlined open channels and the channel side
slopes to at least the design flow level will be sodded with suitable
coarse grass sod.
(4) All unlined open channel side slopes above the design minimum
flow level will be topsoiled and seeded or otherwise suitably
stabilized in accordance with an approved soil disturbance permit.
(5) All unlined open channels which can be expected to have a base
flow of five cubic feet per second or more for at least two out of
every 12 months will be provided with a low flow channel using
gabions, riprap, lining, one-third pipe sections or other
arrangements approved as part of the final plat submission.
D. Minimum basis for calculations. The following criteria shall be utilized
unless other agencies having appropriate jurisdiction require design
criteria for greater flows.
(1) Design storm frequency:
(a) For closed conduits: 15 years; or if the above results in a
conduit size at least equivalent to a twenty-one-inch reinforced
concrete pipe, then 20 years for that conduit; or if the above
results in a conduit size at least equivalent to a thirty-inch
reinforced concrete pipe, then 25 years for that conduit; or if
the above results in a conduit size at least equivalent to a fiftyfour-
inch reinforced concrete pipe, then 50 years for that
conduit.
(b) For open channels: 15 years; or if the tributary area exceeds 50
acres, then 25 years; or if the tributary area exceeds 250 acres,
then 50 years. The flooding limits for storms with a return
period of twice the design storm shall be determined for all
open channels. Such limits shall be in the drainage or
conservation easements delineated on the plat.
(c) For detention facilities: a twenty-four-hour flood with a return
period not less than 50 years; or if the tributary area exceeds
50 acres, then 100 years. Design shall be in accordance with
§ 205-134.2 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-134.2
198:856
the criteria established by the Soil Conservation Service,
United States Department of Agriculture.
(d) For gutter flow calculations: 15 years for local and minor
collector streets; 25 years for major collectors and major
thoroughfares; and 50 years for major arterials.
(2) Runoff calculations. Runoff determinations should be made using
the rational formula or, in unusual cases, other methods with the
prior approval of the Planning Board. Upstream areas should be
considered based on their full development potential according to
current zoning or the current use, whichever produces the greatest
runoff. Runoff coefficients used should generally fall in the
following ranges:
Classification, Fully Developed Range of Coefficient
Public parks, open space and land
conservation
0.15 to 0.30
Low-density residential 0.30 to 0.45
Medium-density residential 0.40 to 0.60
High-density residential 0.55 to 0.70
Commercial and industrial 0.60 to 0.90
Pavements, roadways and shoulders 1.00
(3) Velocity restriction.
(a) In general, velocities in closed conduits at design flow should
be at least two feet per second but not more than that velocity
which will cause erosion damage to the conduit. In general,
velocities in open channels at design flow shall not be less than
1/2 foot per second and not greater than that velocity which
will begin to cause erosion or scouring of the channel. For
unlined earth channels, the maximum velocity allowed will be
two feet per second. For other channels, sufficient design data
and soil tests to determine the character of the channel shall
be made by the subdivider and shall be made available to the
Planning Board at the time of drainage review.
(b) At transitions between closed conduits and open channels or
different types of open channels, suitable provisions must be
made to accommodate the velocity transitions. These
provisions may include riprapping, gabions, lining, aprons,
chutes and checks or others, all suitably detailed and approved
as part (c) of the final plat submission. For all flow of 40 cubic
feet per second or more, tailwater depth and velocity
calculations shall be submitted.
(4) Design formulas and friction factors. In general, the Manning
Formula will be used by the Planning Board to review the adequacy
§ 205-134.2 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-134.2
198:857
of proposed drainage facilities. Other formulas may be used in
particular cases with the previous agreement of the Board. A
friction factor (n) of 0.0212 will be used for nonporous concrete
pipe; and a factor of 0.020 will be used for fully coated corrugated
metal pipe with paved invert. Commensurate factors will be used
for other pipe type or shapes. A friction factor (n) not less than
0.012 will be used for fully lined concrete channels; a factor not
less than 0.025 will be used for good earth channels; and a factor
not less than 0.100 will be used for fair to poor natural streams
and watercourses. Commensurate factors will be used for other
channel types.
(5) All drainage facilities Carrying runoff from tributary areas larger
than 1/2 square mile must have the approval of the New Jersey
Division of Water Policy and Supply. Such approval shall be granted
prior to approval of a tentative plat.
(6) All encroachments of natural waterways must be referred to the
New Jersey Division of Water Policy and Supply for approval in
accordance with statute. The state may retain jurisdiction, in which
case a permit will be necessary, or may refer the matter to the
County Engineer for review.
(7) All nonpipe culverts shall be designed for AASHO H20-44 loading.
All culverts of any type shall be carried to the roadway right-of-way
and shall terminate with headwalls or other approved end
treatment. All conduits terminating or beginning in open channels
shall be provided with headwalls or other appropriate end
treatment.
(8) Guardrail and/or railings shall be placed at all drainage structures
where the interests of pedestrian or vehicular safety would dictate.
The Planning Board may require that any open channel, other than
naturally occurring streams, be fenced with forty-eight-inch-high
chain link fencing if the banks of the channel are steeper than one
foot vertical for every four feet horizontal and either the total depth
of the channel exceeds four feet or the channel would be expected
to have a depth of flow greater than two feet more often than once
every 10 years. For maintenance purposes, gates may be required
by the Planning Board at intervals of approximately 200 feet.
(9) Storm drainage systems shall be designed to include not only the
proper drainage of the actual area of the specific subdivision, and
the area tributary thereto, but shall also include the disposal of the
stormwater runoff to an adequate outlet or other means of final
disposal of the stormwater, such as lake, pond, running stream or
existing adequate storm sewers.
(10) The use of siltation and sedimentation basins with controlled
outflows may be required during construction or permanently.
E. Special drainage provisions.
§ 205-134.2 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-134.2
198:858
§ 205-134.3. Lots.
(1) The existing system of natural drainage within each subdivision
shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. To this end the
Board may require the preservation of natural drainage swales,
recharge areas, wet-weather ponds and similar features and may
require suitable drainage and conservation easements and possible
increases in lot size to allow usable lots with the preservation of
such features.
(2) Subject to review and approval by the Board, the design of the
subdivision may be modified to take advantage of the natural
drainage features of the land. In such review the Board will use the
following criteria:
(a) The utilization of the natural drainage system to the extent
possible.
(b) The maintenance of the natural drainage system as much as
possible in its unimproved state.
(c) When drainage channels are required, wide shallow swales
with natural vegetation will be preferred to other sections.
(d) The construction of flow-retarding devices, detention areas
and recharge berm to minimize runoff value increases.
(e) Maintenance of base flow in streams, reservoirs and ponds.
(f) The reinforcement, improvement and/or extension of the
natural drainage system to such an extent as is necessary to
eliminate flooding and excess maintenance requirements.
(3) All developments or portions of total schemes of development
which, based upon the tentative plat submission, total 15 or more
acres will be expected, to the extent that the Board considers
possible, to limit the total stormwater runoff from the site after
development to not more than 115% of the runoff from the site in
its undeveloped state. The utilization of the provisions of this
section to limit such runoff are encouraged. However, the Board
may require the use of reasonable artificial methods of detention
and/or recharge if it determines that natural provisions are not
feasible.
(4) The Board may waive the provisions of Subsection E if the nature of
the development, the character of adjacent previously developed
areas or other factors make the utilization of natural drainage
features or runoff limiting devices inadvisable or impractical.
F. Pipe sizes. Minimum pipe sizes shall be 15 inches in diameter or elevenby-
eighteen-inch elliptical pipe, unless otherwise specified herein.
§ 205-134.2 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-134.3
198:859
A. Lot size. Minimum lot size and dimensions shall be governed by other
sections of this chapter, except that:
(1) When either on-site sewage disposal or water supply or both are
proposed, the minimum lot size for PUD shall not be less than 30,000 square
feet. However, the Board of Health may require a larger lot size if it
deems that such increased lot size is necessary for such purposes.
The Planning Board shall abide by the decisions of the Board of
Health in this matter.
(2) The Planning Board may require larger lots where additional area
will partially or completely eliminate the necessity of changes in
grade which in the opinion of the Board would cause unreasonable
destruction of the topography or environment or would create
drainage or erosion problems.
(3) The Planning Board may require larger lots adjacent to collector,
major thoroughfare or major arterial streets where, in the opinion
of the Board, the larger lots promote the health, safety and general
welfare of the public.
B. Lot and block numbers. In accordance with the Tax Map Specifications
of the State of New Jersey, dated January 1968, prepared by the State of
New Jersey, Department of the Treasury, as amended, subdivided lots
and blocks shall generally bear the original numbers with a number
added as a subscript. The use of letter designations should particularly
be avoided. Prior to final plat approval by the Planning Board, assigned
lot and block number designations shall be reviewed and approved by
the Township Engineer, Tax Assessor and Planning Director.
C. House numbers. House numbers shall be assigned each lot by the
Planning Board after lot and block numbers have been approved, but
prior to final plat approval by the Planning Board.
D. Area and side lot lines. Lot dimensions and area shall not be less than
the requirements of this chapter or as may be approved by the Planning
Board. Insofar as is practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to
straight streets and radial to curved streets.
E. Unsuitable lots. All lots shall be suitable for the purpose for which they
are intended to be used. To prevent the use of lots which are not
suitable because of adverse topography, rock formations, flood
conditions or similar circumstances, the Planning Board may require
such revisions in the layout of the subdivision as will accomplish one of
the following:
(1) The area of the unsuitable lots is included in other lots by
increasing the size of the remaining lots.
(2) It is included in an area to be deeded to the Township or other
public or quasi-public body and will be held in its natural state for
conservation and/or recreation purposes.
§ 205-134.3 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-134.3
198:860
§ 205-134.4. Blocks.
§ 205-134.5. Easements.
(3) Some other suitable arrangement is made.
A. Block length and width or acreage within bounding roads shall be such
as to accommodate the size of lot required in the zone and to provide
for convenient access, circulation control and safety of vehicles and
pedestrians.
B. Block lengths may vary between 500 and 3,000 feet, but blocks along
other than local, minor collector or collector streets shall not be less
than 1,200 feet long. Interior crosswalks with a right-of-way 20 feet
wide containing a sidewalk of from four feet to 16 feet wide and fenced
on both sides may be required for blocks longer than 1,200 feet, from
the ends of culs-de-sac to adjacent streets and elsewhere as required by
the public convenience, including the provision of walks giving access
to schools, playgrounds and shopping centers, without the necessity of
crossing traffic thoroughfares.
A. Drainage easements.
(1) If the property on which a proposed subdivision is to be located is
or is proposed to be traversed by a drainage facility of any kind,
including a pipe, a channel, a stream or a swale, the Planning
Board may require that a stormwater and drainage easement or
right-of-way along said facility be provided by the subdivider. If
existing land drainage structures, such as French drains, are
encountered during the course of construction of any subdivision,
such drainage structures shall either be removed entirely or a
revised final plat showing the location of such drainage structures
and accompanied with detailed cross sections thereof shall be filed
with the Township Engineer for consideration by the Planning
Board.
(2) All easements shall be shown on the final plat with a notation as to
the purpose and restrictions of the easement. Easement lines on
the final plat shall be shown with accurate dimensions and bearings
unless the easement lines are parallel or concentric with lot lines.
(3) The Planning Board, after consulting its Engineer and the Board of
Health, shall either require a drainage easement, require that the
structure be removed in part or in its entirety or recommend such
other action to the Mayor and Council as it deems appropriate. The
land which is the subject of an easement or right-of-way shall, in
the case of storm drains or constructed channels, be of a suitable
width meeting the requirements for design of drainage facilities
enumerated hereinbefore or be a strip which conforms
substantially to the floodplain of any watercourse along both sides
of the watercourse to a width of 50 feet in each direction from the

supplements thereto, and with the provisions of this chapter.
(2) It is further the intent of this chapter to confer upon the Zoning
Board of Adjustment as full and complete powers as may lawfully
be conferred upon such Board, including, but not by way of
limitation, the authority, in connection with any case, action or
proceeding before the Board, to interpret and construe the
provisions of this chapter, or any term, clause, sentence or word
hereof, and the Zoning Map, in accordance with the general rules
of construction applicable to legislative enactments.
(3) The Board may, in appropriate cases and subject to appropriate
conditions and safeguards, grant variances from the terms of this
chapter in accordance with the general or specific rules hereby laid
down that equity shall be done in cases where the strict
construction of the provisions of this chapter would work undue
hardship. The powers and duties of the Board having been
delegated to and imposed upon it by statute, the Board shall in all
cases follow the provisions applicable to it in said P.L. 1975, c. 291,
or subsequent statutes in such case made and provided, and it shall
from time to time furnish to any person requesting the same a copy
of its rules and information as to how appeals or applications may
properly be filed with the Board for its decision thereon.
G. Appeals and applications; checklist.
(1) Appeals to the Board of Adjustment may be taken by any person
aggrieved or by an officer, department, board or agency of the
Township affected by any decision of the administrative officer.
Each appeal shall be taken within the 65 days prescribed by the
statute by filing a notice of appeal with the officer from whom the
appeal was taken, together with four copies of said notice with the
Secretary of the Board of Adjustment. Said notice of appeal shall
specify the grounds for said appeal. The officer from whom the

date set for the hearing, the applicant shall also file all plot plans,
maps or other papers required by virtue of any provision of this
chapter or any rule of the Board of Adjustment. The applicant shall

198:871
applicant of the steps to be taken to initiate proceedings and of the
regular meeting dates of the Board.
(3) An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action in
respect to which the decision appealed from was made, unless the
officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Board of
Adjustment after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him
that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his
opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case,
proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining
order which may be granted by the Superior Court of New Jersey
on application or notice to the officer from whom the appeal is
taken and on due cause shown.
(4) Applications for bifurcated "d" variances, under N.J.S.A.

by appendix E.166
H. Power to reverse or modify decisions. In exercising the abovementioned
power, the Board of Adjustment may, in conformity with the
provisions of P.L. 1975, c. 291, or amendments thereto or subsequent
statutes applying, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or modify the
order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from and make
such other requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made,
and to that end have all the powers of the administrative officer from
whom the appeal was taken.
I. Expiration of variance. Any variance from the terms of any ordinance
hereafter granted by the Board of Adjustment permitting the erection
or alteration of any structure or structures or permitting a specified use
of any premises shall expire by limitation, unless such construction or
alteration shall have been actually commenced on each and every
structure permitted by said variance or unless such permitted use has
actually been commenced within 12 months from the date of entry of
the judgment or determination of the Board of Adjustment; except,
however, that the running of the period of limitation herein provided
shall be tolled from the date of filing an appeal from the decision of the
Board of Adjustment to the governing body or to a court of competent
jurisdiction until the termination in any manner of such appeal or
proceeding.

that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or

(b) Hear and decide requests for interpretation of the Zoning Map
or Zoning Ordinance, or for decisions upon other special
questions upon which such Board is authorized by the Zoning
Ordinance to pass.
(c) Where, by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or
shape of a specific piece of property or by reason of exceptional
topographic conditions or by reason of other extraordinary and
exceptional situations or conditions of such piece of property,
the strict application of any regulation in the Zoning Ordinance
would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to
or exceptional and undue hardship upon the developer of such
property, grant, upon an application or an appeal relating to
such property, a variance from such strict application of such
regulation so as to relieve such difficulties or hardship;
provided, however, that no variance shall be granted under this
subsection to allow a structure or use in a district restricted
against such structure or use, and further provided that the
proposed development does not require approval by the
Planning Board of a subdivision, site plan or conditional use in
conjunction with which the Planning Board shall review a
request for a variance pursuant to Section 47a of the Municipal
Land Use Law of 1975, P.L. 1975, c. 291.167
(d) Grant a variance to allow a structure or use in a district
restricted against such structure or use in a particular case

this section unless such variance or other relief can be granted
without substantial detriment to the public good and will not
substantially impair the intent and purpose of the zone plan and
Zoning Ordinance. Any application under any subsection of this
section may be referred to any appropriate person or agency,
including the Planning Board, for its report, provided that such
reference shall not extend the period of time within which the
Zoning Board of Adjustment shall act.

constitute a decision favorable to the applicant.
A. Conflict of interest. No member of the Planning Board or Zoning Board
of Adjustment shall act on any matter in which he has, either directly or
indirectly, any personal or financial interest. Whenever any such
member shall disqualify himself from acting on a particular matter, he

escrow deposit to support inspection fees shall be required to be posted
prior to the issuance of any Township permits to construct public
improvements or private site work improvement as specified in
§ 205-133.6D of the Code as follows:
(1) The developer shall, at the time of filing for any Township permits
to construct public improvements or private site work
improvements as specified in § 205-133.6D herein, post an escrow
deposit equal to the greater of $5,000 or 5% of the amount of the
performance guaranty estimates.

performance guaranty estimates for public improvements and
private site work improvements.
(3) For those developments for which the escrow deposit is less than
$10,000, the escrow deposit may, at the option of the developer, be
paid in two installments. The initial amount deposited by the
developer shall be 50% of the total required escrow deposit. When
the balance on deposit drops to 10% of the total required escrow
deposit because the amount deposited by the developer has been
reduced by the amount paid by the Township for inspection, the
developer shall deposit the remaining 50% of the required escrow
deposit.
(4) For those developments where the escrow deposit is greater than
$10,000, the escrow deposit may, at the option of the developer, be

H. Procedures for assessment of charges for technical review and
inspection fees.
§ 205-139 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-139
198:893
(1) General procedures.
(a) All technical review fee and inspection fee escrow deposits
shall be placed into an escrow account which shall be
maintained by the Chief Financial Officer of the Township of
North Brunswick. The Chief Financial Officer shall make all
payments from said escrow account.
(b) All payments charged to an applicant's technical review fee
and inspection fee escrow deposit shall be issued pursuant to
vouchers from the professional performing professional
services in connection with the application. All vouchers shall
identify the professional performing the services, the dates
when services were performed, the hours spent to at least onefourth-
hour increments, the hourly rate and the expenses
incurred.
(c) All outside professionals shall submit vouchers to the Chief
Financial Officer on a monthly basis. A copy of the voucher
shall be sent to the applicant simultaneously. All in-house
professionals shall submit to the Chief Financial Officer, on a
monthly basis, a statement containing the same information as
the voucher of an outside professional. A copy of the statement
shall be simultaneously sent to the applicant.
(d) The Chief Financial Officer shall prepare and send to the
applicant, on a monthly basis, a statement providing an
accounting of the applicant's technical review fee and
inspection fee deposits. The accounting shall include all
deposits made, interest earned, disbursements made and
cumulative deposit balance. Notwithstanding the foregoing to
the contrary, if monthly charges to an applicant's deposit are
$1,000 or less, such statement may be provided by the Chief
Financial Officer on a quarterly basis.
(2) Replenishing of deposit.
(a) If a technical review fee or inspection fee escrow deposit shall
be insufficient to enable the Township or the reviewing board
to perform the required application reviews, the Chief
Financial Officer shall notify the applicant (this notice is
referred to herein as an "insufficiency notice") of both the
insufficient deposit balance and the amount of additional funds
required, in the judgment of the Chief Financial Officer, to cure
the insufficiency. In order for work to continue on the
application, the applicant shall, within a reasonable time
period, post additional funds to the escrow account in an
amount to be agreed upon by the Township (acting through its
Chief Financial Officer) and the applicant.
(b) The determination of insufficiency shall be made by the Chief
Financial Officer in his or her reasonable discretion.
§ 205-139 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-139
198:894
Furthermore, as used herein, a "reasonable time period" for
the posting of additional funds to the escrow account shall be
no longer than 15 days after the date of the Chief Financial
Officer's insufficiency notice. The applicant shall be deemed to
agree to the terms of the insufficiency notice unless within 15
days after the date of such notice the applicant shall deliver to
the Chief Financial Officer a written notice of objection.
(c) If the applicant timely files such an objection, the applicant
shall have the right to pay the amount requested under protest
and the right to challenge the same in the Superior Court, Law
Division, in an action in lieu of prerogative writs filed within 45
days after the applicant received the Chief Financial Officer's
final accounting with respect to the applicant's technical
review fee deposit.
(d) If the applicant fails to timely pay (under protest or otherwise)
the amount requested, the Township, the reviewing board and
all professionals shall have the right to cease all further work
on the application immediately, and the reviewing board shall
have the right to deny, without prejudice, any pending
application because of the applicant's failure to post additional
technical review fees needed for the proper review of such
application. In no event shall any approved plans be signed or
delivered to the applicant nor shall any construction permits,
certificates of occupancy or other approvals or authorizations
be issued to an applicant when there exists any deficiency in
the applicant's technical review fee or inspection fee deposits.
(3) Final accounting and return of unused balance of deposit. After the
reviewing board has granted final approval and signed the
approved subdivision plat or site plan or otherwise taken final
action on the application or upon completion of the construction of
the improvements for which an inspection escrow has been posted,
the applicant shall provide written notice of the same, by certified
mail, returned receipt requested, or by personal delivery, to the
Chief Financial Officer, the reviewing board and all professionals
who have rendered services in connection with the application.
Within 30 days after receipt of such notice, each professional shall
submit a final bill to the Chief Financial Officer with a copy to the
applicant. The Chief Financial Officer shall render to the applicant
a final accounting within 45 days after receipt of all final bills and/
or statements. The Chief Financial Officer shall return to the
applicant with the final accounting any unused balance of the
deposit, including any interest earned thereon.
(4) Interest and administrative expenses.
(a) Whenever an amount of money in excess of $5,000 shall be
deposited by an applicant with the Township for technical
review fee deposits, for inspection fees or to satisfy the

06-25]
§ 205-146. Scope and purpose.
A. Policy statement. This article is written in accordance with the
provisions of N.J.A.C. 7:8. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and
pollutant reduction through nonstructural or low-impact techniques
shall be explored before relying on structural best management
practices (BMPs). Structural BMPs should be integrated with
nonstructural stormwater management strategies and proper
maintenance plans. Nonstructural strategies include both
environmentally sensitive site design and source controls that prevent
pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed to
stormwater. Source control plans should be developed based upon
physical site conditions and the origin, nature, and the anticipated
quantity or amount of potential pollutants. Multiple stormwater
management BMPs may be necessary to achieve the established
performance standards for water quality, quantity, and groundwater
recharge.
B. Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for "major
development," as defined in § 205-147.
C. Applicability.
(1) This article shall be applicable to all site plans and subdivisions for
the following major developments that require preliminary or final
site plan or subdivision review:
(a) Nonresidential major developments; and
(b) Aspects of residential major developments that are not
preempted by the Residential Site Improvement Standards at
N.J.A.C. 5:21.
(2) This article shall also be applicable to all major developments
undertaken by the Township of North Brunswick.
D. Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements.
Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans pursuant
to this article are to be considered an integral part of development
approvals under the subdivision and site plan review process and do not
relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or
approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable code, rule,
act, or ordinance. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this article shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare. This article

198:903
§ 205-149. Requirements for major development.
Stormwater management requirements for major development are as
follows:
plan or Water Quality Management Plan adopted in accordance with
Department rules. Note: Alternative standards shall provide at least
as much protection from stormwater-related loss of groundwater
recharge, stormwater quantity and water quality impacts of major
development projects as would be provided under the standards in
N.J.A.C. 7:8-5.
A. The development shall incorporate a maintenance plan for the
stormwater management measures incorporated into the design of a
major development in accordance with § 205-155.

documented in the Department's Landscape Project or Natural
Heritage Database established under N.J.S.A. 13:1B-15.147 through
15.150, particularly Helonias bullata (swamp pink) and/or Clemmys
muhlnebergi (bog turtle).
C. The following linear development projects are conditionally exempted
from the groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity, and
stormwater runoff quality requirements of Subsections F and G:
(1) The construction of an underground utility line, provided that the
disturbed areas are revegetated upon completion;

existing conditions are maintained to the maximum extent
practicable; and
(3) The construction of a public pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk
or trail with a maximum width of 14 feet, provided that the access
is made of permeable material.
D. A waiver from strict compliance from the groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
requirements of Subsections F and G may be obtained for the
enlargement of an existing public roadway or railroad, or the
construction or enlargement of a public pedestrian access, provided
that the following conditions are met:
(1) The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the
project that cannot be accomplished by any other means;
(2) The applicant demonstrates through an alternatives analysis, that
through the use of nonstructural and structural stormwater
management strategies and measures, the option selected
§ 205-148 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-149
198:904
complies with the requirements of Subsections F and G to the
maximum extent practicable;
(3) The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the requirements
of Subsections F and G, existing structures currently in use, such

condemnation lands not falling under Subsection D(3) above within
the upstream drainage area of the receiving stream, that would
provide additional opportunities to mitigate the requirements of
Subsections F and G that were not achievable on-site.
E. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in Subsections F
and G shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies set forth in this subsection into the design.
The applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures
incorporated into the design of the project. If the applicant
contends that it is not feasible for engineering, environmental, or
safety reasons to incorporate any nonstructural stormwater
management measures identified in Subsection E(2) below into the
design of a particular project, the applicant shall identify the
strategy considered and provide a basis for the contention.
(2) Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated
into site design shall:

particularly susceptible to erosion and sediment loss;
(b) Minimize impervious surfaces and break up or disconnect the
flow of runoff over impervious surfaces;
(c) Maximize the protection of natural drainage features and
vegetation;
(d) Minimize the decrease in the "time of concentration" from

198:905
(h) Provide vegetated open-channel conveyance systems
discharging into and through stable vegetated areas;
(i) Provide other source controls to prevent or minimize the use or
exposure of pollutants at the site, in order to prevent or
minimize the release of those pollutants into stormwater
runoff. Such source controls include, but are not limited to:
[1] Site design features that help to prevent accumulation of
trash and debris in drainage systems, including features
that satisfy Subsection E(3) below;
[2] Site design features that help to prevent discharge of trash
and debris from drainage systems;
[3] Site design features that help to prevent and/or contain
spills or other harmful accumulations of pollutants at
industrial or commercial developments; and
[4] When establishing vegetation after land disturbance,
applying fertilizer in accordance with the requirements
established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and implementing rules.
(3) Site design features identified under Subsection E(2)(i)[2] above
shall comply with the following standard to control passage of solid
and floatable materials through storm drain inlets. For purposes of
this subsection, "solid and floatable materials" means sediment,
debris, trash, and other floating, suspended, or settleable solids.
For exemptions to this standard see Subsection E(3)(c) below.
(a) Grates.
[1] Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a
storm drain or surface water body under that grate:
[a] The New Jersey Department of Transportation
(NJDOT) bicycle-safe grate, which is described in
Chapter 2.4 of the NJDOT Bicycle Compatible
Roadways and Bikeways Planning and Design
Guidelines (April 1996); or
[b] A different grate, if each individual clear space in that
grate has an area of no more than seven square
inches, or is no greater than 0.5 inch across the
smallest dimension.
[2] Examples of grates subject to this standard include grates
in grate inlets, the grate portion (non-curb-opening
portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm sewer
manholes, ditch grates, trench grates, and grates of spacer
§ 205-149 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-149
198:906
bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground surfaces
include surfaces of roads (including bridges), driveways,
parking areas, bikeways, plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields,
open channels, and stormwater basin floors.
(b) Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear
space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if
the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an
area of no more than seven square inches, or be no greater
than two inches across the smallest dimension.
(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in Subsection G(1) are conveyed through any
device (e.g., end-of-pipe netting facility, manufactured
treatment device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed,
at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
[a] A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches
wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inch.
[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars, to
the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified
in Subsection G(1); or
[4] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register listed historic property.
(4) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in Subsections F and
G shall be dedicated to a government agency, subjected to a
conservation restriction filed with the appropriate County Clerk's
office, or subject to an approved equivalent restriction that ensures
that measure or an equivalent stormwater management measure
approved by the reviewing agency is maintained in perpetuity.
§ 205-149 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-149
198:907
(5) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 205-152, or found on the Department's Web
site at www.njstormwater.org.
F. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity and
peak flow rate impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq. and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at § 205-150, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain 100% of the average annual
preconstruction groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from preconstruction to postconstruction for the twoyear
storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the urban redevelopment area, or to
projects subject to Subsection F(1)(b)[3] below.
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or
applied, areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than "reportable
quantities" as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
§ 205-149 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-149
198:908
with a Department-approved remedial action work
plan or landfill closure plan and areas with high risks
for spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
(c) Industrial stormwater exposed to source material. "Source
material" means any material(s) or machinery located at an
industrial facility that is directly or indirectly related to
process, manufacturing or other industrial activities, which
could be a source of pollutants in any industrial stormwater
discharge to groundwater. Source materials include, but are
not limited to, raw materials; intermediate products; final
products; waste materials; by-products; industrial machinery
and fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents that are
related to process, manufacturing, or other industrial activities
that are exposed to stormwater.
[1] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
downgradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(d) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 205-150, complete one of
the following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, postconstruction
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten-, and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the
preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten-, and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
and projected land uses assuming full development under
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage
area;
§ 205-149 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-149
198:909
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
postconstruction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten- and
one-hundred-year storm events are 50%, 75% and 80%,
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the postconstruction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
site on which the proposed development or project is to be
constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to
postconstruction stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or
[4] In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with Subsection F(1)(c)[1], [2] and
[3] above shall only be applied if the increased volume of
stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the
point of discharge.
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of major development at § 205-147 shall be submitted to
the appropriate Soil Conservation District for review and
consideration in accordance with the requirements of this section
and any applicable Soil Conservation District guidelines for
stormwater runoff rate and erosion control. For the purposes of this
section, "agricultural development" means land uses normally
associated with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale.
Such uses do not include the development of land for the
processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally
related products.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
postconstruction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater
runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the developed site,
expressed as an annual average. Stormwater management
measures shall only be required for water quality control if an
additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being proposed on a
development site. The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to
any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric
effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in
a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this
requirement. The water quality design storm is 1.25 inches of
rainfall in two hours. Water quality calculations shall take into
account the distribution of rain from the water quality design
storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation of the volume of
runoff may take into account the implementation of nonstructural
and structural stormwater management measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 205-152, or found on the Department's Web
site at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other sources
of technical guidance are listed in § 205-152. TSS reduction shall
be calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2
below. Alternative removal rates and methods of calculating
removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides
documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative
rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any approved
alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be
provided to the Department at the following address: Division of
Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, P.O. Box 418, Trenton, New Jersey 08625-0418.
(3) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
eighty-percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize
the following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A+B - (AXB)/100
Where
R = total TSS percent load removal from application of both
BMPs
§ 205-149 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-149
198:911
A = TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP
B = TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second BMP
Table 2: TSS Removal Rates for BMPs
Best Management Practice TSS Percent Removal Rate
Bioretention systems 90%
Constructed stormwater
wetland
90%
Extended detention basin 40% to 60%
Infiltration structure 80%
Manufactured treatment
device
See § 205-151C
Sand filter 80%
Vegetative filter strip 60% to 80%
Wet pond 50% to 90%
(4) If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the eighty-percent
TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the
runoff from the subareas converge on site, in which case the
removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a
weighted average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the postconstruction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in Subsections F and G.
(6) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, which may
be obtained from the address identified in § 205-152.
(7) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FWI.
(8) Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and perennial
or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category
One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the
County Soil Surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area.
These areas shall be established for the protection of water quality,
aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional
recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance,
§ 205-149 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-149
198:912
and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category
One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A three-hundred-foot special water resource protection
area shall be provided on each side of the waterway,
measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of
the bank outwards or from the center line of the waterway
where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing
vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural
succession.
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under Subsection G(8)(a)[1]
above shall only be allowed where previous development
or disturbance has occurred (for example, active
agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn area).
The encroachment shall only be allowed where applicant
demonstrates that the functional value and overall
condition of the special water resource protection area will
be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no
case shall the remaining special water resource protection
area be reduced to less than 150 feet as measured
perpendicular to the top of bank of the waterway or center
line of the waterway where the bank is undefined. All
encroachments proposed under this subsection shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(b) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the Standard for Off-Site Stability in the Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under
the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et
seq.
(c) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
Standard for Off-Site Stability in the Standards for Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under the Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq.,
then the stabilization measures in accordance with the
requirements of the above standards may be placed within the
special water resource protection area, provided that:
[1] Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150 feet
of the Category One waterway;
§ 205-149 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-149
198:913
§ 205-150. Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater
recharge.
[2] Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
section shall achieve a ninety-five-percent TSS
postconstruction removal rate;
[3] Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
[4] The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable;
[5] A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate Department staff and Soil Conservation
District staff to identify necessary stabilization measures;
and
[6] All encroachments proposed under this section shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(d) A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan, or by a
municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to Subsection G(8) has been approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection, then the provisions
of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource
protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream
corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to Subsection
G(8) shall maintain or enhance the current functional value
and overall condition of the special water resource protection
area as defined in Subsection G(8)(a)[1] above. In no case shall
a stream corridor protection plan allow the reduction of the
special water resource protection area to less than 150 feet as
measured perpendicular to the waterway subject to this
subsection.
(e) Subsection G(8) does not apply to the construction of one
individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
§ 205-149 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-150
198:914
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Section 4 - Hydrology and
Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds;
or
(b) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition
of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at Subsection A(1)(a) and the Rational and
Modified Rational Methods at subsection A(1)(b). A runoff
coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing
condition may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design
engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has existed on the
site or portion of the site for at least five years without interruption
prior to the time of application. If more than one land cover has
existed on the site during the five years immediately prior to the
time of application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential
shall be used for the computations. In addition, there is the
presumption that the site is in good hydrologic condition (if the
land use type is pasture, lawn, or park), with good cover (if the land
use type is woods), or with good hydrologic condition and
conservation treatment (if the land use type is cultivation).
(3) In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or
culverts, that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds and other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater
management measures.

§ 205-151. Standards for structural stormwater management
measures.
B. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
following:
(1) The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32 A Method for
Evaluating Ground-Water Recharge Areas in New Jersey,
incorporated herein by reference as amended and supplemented.
Information regarding the methodology is available from the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual; at
http://www.state.nj.us/dep/njgs/; or at New Jersey Geological
Survey, 29 Arctic Parkway, P.O. Box 427, Trenton, New Jersey
08625-0427; (609) 984-6587.
A. Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as
follows:
(1) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
take into account the existing site conditions, including, for
example, environmentally critical areas; wetlands; flood-prone
areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high water table; soil type,
permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage patterns; and
the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone).
(2) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and
ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the
intake to the outlet structure as appropriate, and shall have parallel
bars with one-inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of the
water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the water
quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure shall
be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the diameter of the
orifice or 1/3 the width of the weir, with a minimum spacing
between bars of one inch and a maximum spacing between bars of
six inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must comply with
the requirements of § 205-153B.
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosionresistant.
Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions
of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3,
7.4, and 7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
(4) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin,
the orifice size shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 inches in diameter.
(5) Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins at
§ 205-153.

ARTICLE XXXVIII
Personal Wireless Telecommunications Facilities and Equipment
[Added 12-4-2006 by Ord. No. 06-34]
§ 205-157. Findings.
§ 205-158. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ANTENNA or ANTENNAS  Any exterior transmitting or receiving device
mounted on a tower, building or structure and used in communications that
radiate or capture electromagnetic waves, digital signals, analog signals,
radio frequencies (excluding radar signals), wireless telecommunications
signals, television signals, pagers and other communications signals. For
the purposes of this article, "cellular antennas," as referred to in the 1966
Federal Telecommunications Act, shall not be deemed a public utility.
ANTENNA SUPPORT STRUCTURE  A structure, other than a
telecommunications tower, which is attached to a building and on which one
or more antennas are located.
A. The federal government, through the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC), has issued personal wireless telecommunications
licenses for personal telecommunications services and other wireless
technologies; and
B. The FCC requires license holders to provide coverage to areas where
personal wireless telecommunications licenses have been acquired and
this may require that such facilities be constructed in specified
locations and manners determined by engineering standards to achieve
such coverage; and
C. The Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 (FTA) preserves local
zoning authority to reasonably regulate personal wireless
telecommunications facilities (PWTFs); but the FTA mandates that
localities may not unreasonably discriminate among FCC license
holders and that localities cannot prohibit or adopt regulations which
have the effect of prohibiting the provision of wireless services, and the
FTA gives the FCC sole jurisdiction over radio frequency emissions of
PWTFs so long as PWTFs meet FCC standards; and
D. It is necessary to reasonably regulate PWTFs and associated personal
wireless telecommunications equipment facilities (PWTEFs) to
minimize potential aesthetic impacts; and
E. There is a public need for new provisions in the Township of North
Brunswick's Land Use Ordinance to address the site locations of
PWTFs, PWTEFs and antennas.
§ 205-157 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-158
198:927
BACKHAUL NETWORK  Lines that connect a provider's towers/cell sites
to one or more telephone switching offices, and/or long distance providers,
or the public switched telephone network.
COLLOCATION  Use of a common PWTF or a common site by two or more
wireless license holders or by one wireless license holder for more than
one type of communications technology and/or placement of a PWTF on a
structure owned or operated by a utility or other public entity.
FAA  The Federal Aviation Administration.
FCC  The Federal Communications Commission.
PERSONAL WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITY (PWTF) 
Facilities for the provision of wireless communications services, including,
but not limited to, antennas, antenna support structures,
telecommunications towers, and related facilities other than PWTEFs.
PERSONAL WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT
FACILITIES (PWTEF)  Accessory facilities serving and subordinate in
area, extent and purpose to, and on the same lot as, a telecommunications
tower or antenna location. Such facilities include, but are not limited to,
transmission equipment, storage sheds, storage buildings, and security
fencing.
PLANNING BOARD  The Planning Board of the Township of North
Brunswick.
PUBLIC VIEW  Visible from a public thoroughfare, public lands or
buildings or navigable waterways.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWER  Any structure that is designed and
constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one or more antennas
for telephone, radio and similar communications purpose, including selfsupporting
lattice towers, guy towers or monopole towers. The term
includes radio and television transmission towers, microwave towers,
common carrier towers, cellular telephone towers, alternative tower
structures and the like. The term includes the structure and any supports
thereunto: freestanding structures on which one or more antennas are
located, including lattice towers, guyed towers, monopoles and similar
structures.
WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS  Any personal wireless services as
defined in the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 (FTA), which
includes FCC-licensed commercial wireless telecommunications services,
including cellular, personal communication services (PCS), specialized
mobile radio (SMR), enhanced specialized mobile radio (ESMR), paging,
and similar services that currently exist or that may in the future be
developed. It does not include any amateur radio facility that is owned
and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station operation or is
used exclusively for receive-only antennas, nor does it include noncellular
telephone services.
§ 205-159. Purpose and goals.
§ 205-158 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-159
198:928
§ 205-160. Overall objective.
The overall objective of this article is to allow the provision of personal
wireless communications services which have been determined by the
Telecommunications Act to be necessary and protected to provide full and
seamless communication services, while simultaneously limiting the
number of telecommunications PWTFs and PWTEFs to the fewest possible
as reasonably practicable and only in those locations which do not
negatively impact upon the prevailing visual character of the Township of
North Brunswick. Because the Telecommunications Act has recognized that
service carriers have the right to provide cellular communication service
within municipalities, it is also the objective of this article that many of
the different carriers locate their antennas on the same telecommunications
tower to limit the overall number of telecommunications towers within the
Township of North Brunswick to the extent reasonably practicable.
A. The purpose of this article is to provide sound land use policies,
procedures, regulations and specific zoning conditions for PWTFs and
PWTEFs to protect the Township of North Brunswick from the visual or
other adverse impacts of these facilities, and to safeguard the public
good, health, safety and welfare and preserve the intent and the
purposes of the Township of North Brunswick's Master Plan and Land
Use Ordinance while encouraging the unobtrusive development of
PWTFs and PWTEFs to provide comprehensive wireless
telecommunications services in the Township of North Brunswick to
benefit its residents and businesses. This article expresses a preference
that telecommunications providers locate antennas on existing
buildings and telecommunications towers, or that any PWTFs and
PWTEFs be constructed on municipal or other priority locations as set
forth herein; and, further, encourages collocation and site sharing of
new and existing PWTFs and PWTEFs. This article seeks to meet the
mandate of the Telecommunications Act of 1966, while simultaneously
seeking to limit the proliferation of telecommunications towers and
appurtenances.
B. It is understood by the Township of North Brunswick that the federal
government, through the FCC; issues licenses for personal wireless
communications and that the FCC requires license holders to provide
coverage within the areas so licensed.
C. It is also understood by the Township of North Brunswick that the FTA
expressly preserves the zoning authority of a municipality to regulate
the placement, construction and modification of PWTEFs subject to the
six limitations cited at § 332(c)(7)(B) of the FTA. Accordingly, the FTA
does not abrogate local zoning authority in favor of the commercial
desire to offer optimal service to all current and potential customers,
and the providers of the personal wireless services must bear the
burden of proving that any proposed service facility is the least
intrusive means of filling a significant gap in personal wireless
communications services in a given area.
§ 205-159 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-161
198:929
§ 205-161. Specific goals.
The specific goals of this article are:
§ 205-162. Exemptions.
This article shall not apply to any telecommunications tower or the
installation of any antennas that are under 70 feet high and which are
owned and operated solely by a federally licensed amateur radio station
operator or which are used exclusively to receive transmissions; nor shall it
apply to any parabolic satellite antennas or nonwireless telephone services.
§ 205-163. Collocation policy.
A. To limit the impact of personal wireless communications antennas,
telecommunications towers and related facilities upon the residences
and streetscapes throughout the Township of North Brunswick.
B. To encourage the location of antennas upon, or within, existing
structures, including, but not limited to, existing steeples, cupolas,
industrial buildings, telecommunications towers, catenary support
towers and other towers and water standpipes.
C. To encourage the collocation of antennas on the fewest number of
existing structures within the Township of North Brunswick.
D. To encourage the communications carriers to configure their facilities
in a manner that minimizes and mitigates any adverse impacts upon
affected properties, streetscapes and viewscapes through careful
design, site location, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging
techniques.
E. To encourage the use of alternative technologies which do not require
the use of telecommunications towers or require telecommunications
towers at relatively lesser heights.
F. To enhance the ability of the carriers of personal wireless
communications services who adhere to the letter and intent of this
article to provide such services quickly, effectively and efficiently.
G. To comply with the mandate of the FTA, 47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7), which
preserves local government authority to enforce zoning requirements
that protect public safety, public and private property and community
aesthetics.
A. The Township Engineer shall maintain an inventory of existing PWTF
and PWTEF locations within or near the Township of North Brunswick.
B. An applicant proposing a PWTF/PWTEF at a new location shall
demonstrate that it made its best business efforts to find a collocation
site acceptable to Township engineering standards and that none was
available, or practicable or economically feasible.
§ 205-161 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-163
198:930
C. An applicant proposing a PWTF/PWTEF at a new location, who has
demonstrated its inability to collocate pursuant to Subsection B herein,
shall provide a letter of intent, in a form to be reviewed and approved
by the Township Planning Board Attorney or Zoning Board of
Adjustment Attorney, as applicable, which warrants and represents that
applicant shall share the use of its PWTFs/PWTEFs with any other
approved cellular communication services providers at fair market
value. Such collocation requirement shall be a material condition of
approval.
D. Each application for a PWTF/PWTEF shall be accompanied by a plan
which shall reference all existing PWTF/PWTEF locations in the
applicant's Township of North Brunswick inventory, any such facilities
in the abutting towns which provide service to areas within the
Township of North Brunswick and any anticipated changes proposed
within the following twelve-month period, including plans for new
locations and the discontinuance or relocation of existing facilities.
E. Each application shall include a site location alternative analysis
describing the location of other sites considered, the availability of
those sites, the extent to which other sites do or do not meet the
providers' service or engineering needs, and the reason why the subject
site was chosen. The analysis shall address the following issues:
(1) How the proposed location of the PWTF/PWTEF relates to the
objective of providing full wireless communication services within
the Township of North Brunswick at the time full service is
provided by the applicant throughout the Township of North
Brunswick.
(2) How the proposed location of the proposed PWTF/PWTEF relates
to the location of any existing antennas within and near the
Township of North Brunswick.
(3) How the proposed location of the proposed PWTF/PWTEF relates
to the anticipated need for additional antennas within and near the
Township of North Brunswick by the applicant and by other
providers of wireless communication services within the Township
of North Brunswick.
(4) How the proposed location of the proposed PWTF/PWTEF relates
to the objective of collocating the antennas of many different
providers of wireless communication services on the same PWTF;
and
(5) How its plan specifically relates to and is coordinated with the
needs of all other providers of wireless communication services
within the Township of North Brunswick.
F. The Planning Board, or Board of Adjustment, may retain technical
consultants as it deems necessary to provide assistance in the review of
the site location alternatives analysis. The applicant and/or service

Steep Slopes
[Added 10-1-2012 by Ord. No. 12-18]
§ 205-176. Scope and purpose.
§ 205-177. Applicability.
This article shall be applicable to new development or land disturbance on
a steep slope within the Township of North Brunswick.
§ 205-178. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
DISTURBANCE  The placement of impervious surface, the exposure or
movement of soil or bedrock, or the clearing, cutting, or removing of
vegetation.
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE  Any structure, surface, or improvement that
reduces or prevents absorption of stormwater into land, and includes
porous paving, paver blocks, gravel, crushed stone, decks, patios, elevated
structures, and other similar structures, surfaces, or improvements.
REDEVELOPMENT  The construction of structures or improvements on
areas which previously contained structures or other improvements.
STEEP SLOPES  Any slope equal to or greater than 20% as measured over
any minimum run of 10 feet. Steep slopes are determined based on contour
intervals of two feet or less.
§ 205-179. Designation of areas.
The percent of slope (rise in feet per horizontal distance) shall be
established by measurement of distance perpendicular to the contour of the
A. The purpose of this article is to regulate the intensity of use in areas of
steeply sloping terrain in order to limit soil loss, erosion, excessive
stormwater runoff, the degradation of surface water and to maintain
the natural topography and drainage patterns of land.
B. Disturbance of steep slopes results in accelerated erosion processes
from stormwater runoff and the subsequent sedimentation of
waterbodies with the associated degradation of water quality and loss
of aquatic life support. Related effects include soil loss, changes in
natural topography and drainage patterns, increased flooding potential,
further fragmentation of forest and habitat areas, and compromised
aesthetic values. It has become widely recognized that disturbance of
steep slopes should be restricted or prevented based on the impact
disturbance of steep slopes can have on water quality and quantity, and
the environmental integrity of landscapes.
§ 205-176 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-179
198:943
slope. The percent of slope shall be calculated for each two-foot contour
interval. For example, any location on the site where there is a one-foot rise
over a ten-foot horizontal run constitutes a ten-percent slope; a one-andone-
half-foot rise over a ten-foot horizontal run constitutes a fifteen-percent
slope; a two-foot rise over a ten-foot horizontal run constitutes a twentypercent
slope.
§ 205-180. Steep slope limits.
For steep slopes any disturbance shall be prohibited except as provided
below:
§ 205-181. Enforcement; violations and penalties.
A. Redevelopment within the limits of existing impervious surfaces.
B. New disturbance necessary to protect public health, safety or welfare,
such as necessary linear development with no feasible alternative; to
provide an environmental benefit, such as remediation of a
contaminated site; or, to prevent an extraordinary and exceptional
situation uniquely affecting a specific property that would create a
hardship affecting the property, preventing a minimum economically
viable use of the affected property based upon reasonable investment,
provided that the hardship was not created by the property owner, for
example, redevelopment, within the footprint of existing impervious
cover should be allowed to support efforts to revitalize development
that has fallen into disrepair.
C. The applicant shall demonstrate through site plans depicting proposed
development and topography that new disturbance is not located in
areas with a twenty-percent or greater slope.
A. A prompt investigation shall be made by the appropriate personnel of
the Township of North Brunswick, of any person or entity believed to be
in violation hereof. If upon inspection, a condition which is in violation
of this article is discovered, a civil action in the Special Civil Part of the
Superior Court, or in the Superior Court, if the primary relief sought is
injunctive or if penalties may exceed the jurisdictional limit of the
Special Civil Part, may be commenced by the filing and serving of
appropriate process. Nothing in this article shall be construed to
preclude the right of the Township of North Brunswick, pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 26:3A2-25, to initiate legal proceedings hereunder in Municipal
Court. The violation of any section or subsection of this article shall
constitute a separate and distinct offense independent of the violation
of any other section or subsection, or of any order issued pursuant to
this article. Each day a violation continues shall be considered a
separate offense.
B. Any person who erects, constructs, alters, repairs, converts, maintains,
or uses any building, structure or land in violation of this article shall be
subject to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or imprisonment for a term not
§ 205-179 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 205-181
198:944
exceeding 90 days, or both. Each day in which such violation continues
shall constitute a separate violation or offense. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the Township of North Brunswick from taking
such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation.

Riparian Zones
[Added 10-1-2012 by Ord. No. 12-17]
§ 205-182. Intent and purpose.
A. The governing body of the Township of North Brunswick finds that
riparian lands adjacent to streams, lakes, or other surface water bodies
that are adequately vegetated provide an important environmental
protection and water resource management benefit. It is necessary to
protect and maintain the beneficial character of riparian areas by
implementing specifications for the establishment, protection, and
maintenance of vegetation along the surface water bodies within the
jurisdiction of the Township of North Brunswick, consistent with the
interest of landowners in making reasonable economic use of parcels of
land that include such designated areas. The purpose of this article is to
designate riparian zones, and to provide for land use regulation therein
in order to protect the streams, lakes, and other surface water bodies of
the Township of North Brunswick and to comply with N.J.A.C.
7:15-5.25(G)3 which requires municipalities to adopt regulations to
protect the water quality of watercourses, reservoirs, lakes, and other
significant water resources within the Township of North Brunswick; to
protect the riparian and aquatic ecosystems of the Township of North
Brunswick; to provide for the environmentally sound use of the land
resources of the Township of North Brunswick, and to complement
existing state, regional, county, and municipal stream corridor
protection and management regulations and initiatives.
B. The specific purpose and intent of this article is to:
(1) Restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological
integrity of the water resources of the Township of North
Brunswick;
(2) Prevent excessive nutrients, sediment, and organic matter, as well
as biocides and other pollutants, from reaching surface waters by
optimizing opportunities for filtration, deposition, absorption,
adsorption, plant uptake, biodegradation, and denitrification,
which occur when stormwater runoff is conveyed through
vegetated buffers as stable, distributed flow prior to reaching
receiving waters;
(3) Provide for shading of the aquatic environment so as to moderate
temperatures, retain more dissolved oxygen, and support a healthy
assemblage of aquatic flora and fauna;
(4) Provide for the availability of natural organic matter (leaves and
twigs) and large woody debris (trees and limbs) that provide food
and habitat for aquatic organisms (insects, amphibians,
crustaceans, and small fish), which are essential to maintain the
food chain;
§ 205-182 HOUSING PRESERVATION AND § 205-182
198:947

ACID-PRODUCING SOILS  Soils that contain geologic deposits of iron
sulfide minerals (pyrite and marcasite) which, when exposed to oxygen
from the air or from surface waters, oxidize to produce sulfuric acid. Acidproducing
soils, upon excavation, generally have a pH of 4.0 or lower.
After exposure to oxygen, these soils generally have a pH of 3.0 or lower.
Information regarding the location of acid-producing soils in New Jersey can
be obtained from local Soil Conservation District offices.
ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY  The Planning Board or Zoning Board
of Adjustment or Construction Office with all of the powers delegated,
assigned, or assumed by them according to statute or ordinance.
APPLICANT  A person, corporation, government body or other legal entity
applying to the Planning Board, Board of Adjustment or the Construction
(5) Increase stream bank stability and maintain natural fluvial
geomorphology of the stream system, thereby reducing stream

riparian zone, including obtaining variances from setback or other
requirements that would allow conformance with the riparian zone
requirements, and provided the following demonstrations are made:
(1) An applicant shall be deemed to have established the existence of
an extreme economic hardship, if the subject property is not
capable of yielding a reasonable economic return if its present use
is continued or if it is developed in accordance with provisions of
this article, and that this inability to yield a reasonable economic
return results from unique circumstances peculiar to the subject
property which:
(a) Do not apply to or affect other property in the immediate
vicinity;
(b) Relate to or arise out of the characteristics of the subject
property because of the particular physical surroundings,
shape or topographical conditions of the property involved,

not defined in this article have the same meaning as those defined in
N.J.A.C. 7:29.
CONSTRUCTION  Any site preparation, assembly, erection, repair,
alteration or similar action of buildings or structures.
dBC  The sound level as measured using the "C" weighting network with
a sound level meter meeting the standards set forth in ANSI S1.4-1983 or

a state of emergency declared by a governing agency.
A. Whereas, excessive sound is a serious hazard to the public health,
welfare, safety and the quality of life; and whereas a substantial body of
science and technology exists by which excessive sound may be
substantially abated; and whereas the people have a right to and should
be ensured an environment free from excessive sound; now, therefore,
it is the policy of Township of North Brunswick to prevent excessive
sound that may jeopardize the health, welfare or safety of the citizens
or degrade the quality of life.
B. This article shall apply to the control of sound originating from
stationary sources within the limits of the Township of North

as defined herein, the vertical or horizontal boundaries between the two
portions of the property on which different categories of activity are being
performed (e.g., if the multiuse property is a building which is residential
upstairs and commercial downstairs, then the real property line would be
the interface between the residential area and the commercial area, or
if there is an outdoor sound source such as an HVAC unit on the same
parcel of property, the boundary line is the exterior wall of the receiving
unit). Note: This definition shall not apply to a commercial source and a

§ 238-10.3 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 238-10.4
222:1032
§ 238-10.5. Motor vehicles.
Violations of each subsection of this section shall be considered purposeful
and therefore nonminor violations.
E. Self-contained, portable, nonvehicular music or sound production
devices shall not be operated on a public space or public right-of-way in
such a manner as to be plainly audible at a distance of 50 feet in any
direction from the operator between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 9:00
p.m., Sunday through Thursday, and 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., Friday
and Saturday. At all other times, sound operated on a public space or
public right-of-way from such equipment shall not be plainly audible at
a distance of 25 feet in any direction from the operator.
F. It shall be unlawful for any property owner or tenant to allow any
domesticated or caged animal to create a sound across a real property
line which unreasonably disturbs or interferes with the peace, comfort,
and repose of any resident, or to refuse or intentionally fail to cease the
unreasonable noise when ordered to do so by a Noise Control Officer or
Noise Control Investigator.
(1) Prima facie evidence of a violation of this section shall include but
not be limited to:
(a) Vocalizing (howling, yelping, barking, squawking, etc.) for five
minutes without interruption, defined as an average of four or
more vocalizations per minute in that period; or
(b) Vocalizing for 20 minutes intermittently, defined as an average
of two vocalizations or more per minute in that period.
(2) It is an affirmative defense under this subsection that the dog or
other animal was intentionally provoked to bark or make any other
noise.
A. No person shall remove or render inoperative, or cause to be removed
or rendered inoperative or less effective than originally equipped, other
than for the purposes of maintenance, repair, or replacement, of any
device or element of design incorporated in any motor vehicle for the
purpose of noise control. No person shall operate a motor vehicle or
motorcycle which has been so modified. A vehicle not meeting these
requirements shall be deemed in violation of this provision if it is
operated stationary or in motion in any public space or public right-ofway.
B. No motorcycle shall be operated stationary or in motion unless it has a
muffler that complies with and is labeled in accordance with the
Federal Noise Regulations under 40 CFR 205.
C. Personal or commercial vehicular music amplification or reproduction
equipment shall not be operated in such a manner that it is plainly
§ 238-10.4 MEAT PACKAGING AND LABELING § 238-10.5
222:1033
§ 238-10.6. Enforcement; violations and penalties.
audible at distance of 25 feet in any direction from the operator
between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m.
D. Personal or commercial vehicular music amplification or reproduction
equipment shall not be operated in such a manner that is plainly
audible at a distance of 50 feet in any direction from the operator
between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.
A. Violation of any provision of this article shall be cause for a notice of
violation (NOV) or a notice of penalty assessment (NOPA) document to
be issued to the violator by the Noise Control Officer or Noise Control
Investigator.
B. Any person who violates any provision of this article shall be subject to
a civil penalty for each offense of not more than the maximum penalty
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:49-5, which is $2,000 as of December 2014. If
the violation is of a continuing nature, each day during which it occurs
shall constitute an additional, separate, and distinct offense.
C. Upon identification of a violation of this article, the Noise Control
Officer or Noise Control Investigator shall issue an enforcement
document to the violator. The enforcement document shall identify the
condition or activity that constitutes the violation and the specific
provision of this article that has been violated. It shall also indicate
whether the violator has a period of time to correct the violation before
a penalty is sought.
D. If the violation is deemed by the Noise Control Officer or Noise Control
Investigator to be a minor violation (as defined in § 238-6), an NOV shall
be issued to the violator.
(1) The document shall indicate that the purpose of the NOV is
intended to serve as a notice to warn the responsible party/violator
of the violation conditions in order to provide them with an
opportunity to voluntarily investigate the matter and voluntarily
take corrective action to address the identified violation.
(2) The NOV shall identify the time period (up to 90 days), pursuant to
the Grace Period Law, N.J.S.A. 13:1D-125 et seq., where the
responsible party's/violator's voluntary action can prevent a formal
enforcement action with penalties issued by the Noise Control
Officer or Noise Control Investigator. It shall be noted that the NOV
does not constitute a formal enforcement action, a final agency
action or a final legal determination that a violation has occurred.
Therefore, the NOV may not be appealed or contested.
E. If the violation is deemed by the Noise Control Officer or Noise Control
Investigator to be a nonminor violation, the violator shall be notified
that if the violation is not immediately corrected, an NOPA with a civil
penalty of not more than the maximum penalty allowed pursuant to
§ 238-10.5 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 238-10.6
222:1034
N.J.S.A. 40:49-5, which is $2,000 as of December 2014, will be issued.
If a nonminor violation is immediately corrected, an NOV without a civil
penalty shall still be issued to document the violation. If the violation
occurs again (within 12 months of the initial violation), an NOPA shall
be issued regardless of whether the violation is immediately corrected
or not.
F. The violator may request from the Noise Control Officer or Noise
Control Investigator an extension of the compliance deadline in the
enforcement action. The Noise Control Officer or Noise Control
Investigator shall have the option to approve any reasonable request for
an extension (not to exceed 180 days) if the violator can demonstrate
that a good faith effort has been made to achieve compliance. If an
extension is not granted and the violation continues to exist after the
grace period ends, an NOPA shall be issued.
G. The recipient of an NOPA shall be entitled to a hearing in a municipal
court having jurisdiction to contest such action.
H. The Noise Control Officer or Noise Control Investigator may seek
injunctive relief if the responsible party does not remediate the
violation within the period of time specified in the NOPA issued.
I. Any claim for a civil penalty may be compromised and settled based on
the following factors:
(1) Mitigating or any other extenuating circumstances.
(2) The timely implementation by the violator of measures which lead
to compliance.
(3) The conduct of the violator.
(4) The compliance history of the violator.

any elementary or secondary school or school board and of the areas on or
within 1,000 feet of such school property.
§ 238-23. Drug Free School Zone Map constitutes official record.
The Drug Free School Zone Map approved and adopted pursuant to
§ 238-22 of this article shall continue to constitute an official finding and
record as to the location and boundaries of areas on or within 1,000 feet
of property owned by or leased to any elementary or secondary school
or school board which is used for school purposes until such time, if any,
that this article shall be amended to reflect any additions or deletions with

Middlesex County Prosecutor.
§ 238-26. Findings and declarations.
The following additional matters are hereby determined, declared, recited
and stated for the purpose of this article:
A. It is understood that the Drug Free School Zone Map approved and
adopted pursuant to § 238-22 of this article was prepared and is
intended to be used as evidence in prosecutions arising under the
criminal laws of this state and that, pursuant to state law, each Drug
Free School Zone Map shall constitute prima facie evidence of the
following:
(1) The location of elementary and secondary schools within the
Township of North Brunswick;
(2) The boundaries of the real property which is owned by or leased to
such schools or a school board;
(3) That such school property is and continues to be used for school
purposes; and
(4) The location and boundaries of areas which are on or within 1,000
feet of such school property.
B. Except as otherwise expressly noted on the face of the approved and

property was owned or leased by or to a school or school board and is
being used for school purposes.

The failure of the Drug Free School Zone Map approved and adopted by
this article to depict the location and boundaries of any property which
is, in fact, used for school purposes and which is owned by or leased to
any elementary or secondary school or school board, whether the
absence of such depiction is the result of inadvertent omission or the
result of any changes in the location and boundaries of such property
which have not yet been incorporated into a revised approved Drug
Free School Zone Map, shall not be deemed to be an official finding and
record that such property is not owned by or leased to a school or
school board or that such property is not used for school purposes.
D. All of the requirements set forth in N.J.S.A. 2C:35-7 et seq. concerning
the preparation, approval and adoption of a Drug Free School Zone
Map have been complied with.

ARTICLE II
General Provisions
[Adopted 5-15-1989]
§ 243-24. Findings of fact. [Amended 5-18-1998 by Ord. No. 98-6]
It is hereby found that there exists a need in the Township of North
Brunswick for the establishment of minimum standards for the maintenance
of building exteriors and outside property areas and to establish minimum
heating requirements for rental dwelling units where furnishing heat is
the responsibility of the owner. This finding is based upon observance of
properties where the lack of maintenance and upkeep has resulted in either
the creation of threats of the public health, safety and welfare or the
presence of potentially blighting conditions which could negatively affect
property values.
§ 243-25. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety and welfare
by establishing minimum standards to govern the maintenance, appearance
and condition of building exteriors and outside property areas for both
residential and nonresidential premises.

All residential and nonresidential buildings, structures and premises shall
comply with the provisions of this article, regardless of whether such
buildings or structures shall have been constructed, altered or repaired
before the enactment of this article and irrespective of any permits or
licenses which shall have been issued for the use or occupancy of the
premises.
§ 243-27. Construal.
This article establishes minimum standards for property maintenance, and
the provisions of this article shall not be construed to prevent the
enforcement of other ordinances or regulations which may be more
stringent.
§ 243-28. Effect on existing remedies.
Nothing in this article shall be deemed to abolish or impair existing
remedies available to the township, its officers or agencies relating to the
removal or demolition of any buildings or structures which are deemed to
be dangerous, unsafe or unsanitary.
§ 243-29. Definitions.

charged against the owner of the said premises, and the amount thereof
shall become a lien upon such lands and shall be added to and become
and form part of the taxes next to be assessed and levied upon such

(2) Change of tenant. Where there is change of tenant as a result of the
previous tenant's vacating a unit, the unit vacated shall be
decontrolled for the initial lease only. The landlord shall not be

(1) In the event that a tax appeal is taken and the landlord is successful
in the appeal and taxes are reduced and a rebate made to the
landlord, the tenants shall receive 50% of the total rebate, as
applied pro rata to each tenant's proportionate living space so
leased. The landlord shall not be entitled to deduct from said
reduction amount any expenses incurred in connection with the
appeal. The landlord shall, within 30 days of receipt of this tax
refund, identify for each tenant and the Rent Leveling Board, in
writing:
(a) The total tax refund.
(b) The tenant's share of the refund.
(c) The individual tenant's proportionate share of the tax refund.
(d) The method of computation of the tenant's proportionate share
of the tax refund.
(2) If the tenant is still residing in the dwelling or complex, then the
tenant's proportionate share of the refund shall be deducted from
his next rent payment. A tenant who is no longer residing in the
dwelling or complex is entitled to his proportionate share of the tax
refund. The landlord shall so inform him by sending a notice to his
198. Editor's Note: Section 12 of this ordinance provided that the provisions of the amendatory
ordinance shall be retroactive to January 1, 1989. Any rents paid from January 1, 1989,
which include a tax surcharge shall be reimbursed or credited to the tenant equal to the

forwarding address. Money unclaimed after 60 days shall revert to
the township for general purposes.
D. Major capital improvement surcharge. [Amended 5-1-1989]
(1) A landlord may seek a major capital improvement surcharge for
qualified improvements, subject to the following requirements:
(a) Following the completion of the improvement, but in no event
later than six months after such completion, the landlord shall
make application to the Board for a major capital improvement
surcharge. The application shall be made on the form provided
by the Board and shall be submitted to the Board, along with
all supporting documentation, at least 90 days before the
proposed effective date of the surcharge.
(b) At least 60 days prior to the proposed effective date of the
surcharge, the Board shall establish a hearing date. Thirty
days prior to the hearing date, the owner shall notify all
tenants of the total cost of the completed improvement, the
number of years of useful life of the improvement as
determined with reference to the regulations of the Internal
Revenue Service concerning straight-line depreciation of
capital improvements, the average annual cost of the
improvement as described below, the need for such
improvement, the benefit to the tenant and the effective date of
the proposed increase.
(c) At the hearing, the Board shall afford all parties a full
opportunity to be heard and to present any testimony or
evidence relevant to the matter before the Board. The Board
will then determine if the improvement is major in character
and, if so, whether the cost was reasonable. A capital
improvement surcharge, however, shall not include any
interest expense paid by the landlord or the cost of repair or
service of the improvement, as only the initial cost of the
improvement is eligible for inclusion in the surcharge. In
calculating the capital improvement surcharge to be granted, if
any, the cost of the improvement shall be divided by the
number of years of useful life of such improvement, with
reference again being made to the regulations of the Internal
Revenue Service concerning straightline depreciation of
capital improvements, to determine the average annual cost of
such improvement. If the improvement will benefit all units in
the dwelling, the average annual cost of the improvement shall
be divided by the total square feet of the dwelling to determine
the surcharge per square foot, which figure shall then be
multiplied by the total square feet occupied by the tenant to
arrive at the surcharge. If the improvement effects only
specific units, then only those tenants who receive the benefit
shall be surcharged.
§ 268-6 REFRIGERATORS, ABANDONED § 268-6
262:1109
(d) The total annual surcharge for all capital improvements
applicable to each tenant shall not exceed 10% of his base
rental and shall be payable in 12 equal monthly installments.
(e) Surcharges granted shall not be considered as base rent in
calculating future annual rent increases.
(2) A landlord may also seek an early determination from the Board as
to whether a contemplated improvement, or any part thereof, will
be considered a major capital improvement under this section and
what portion of the estimated cost of the improvement is eligible
for the surcharge. The Board will also make a determination as to
the useful life of the improvement. The landlord must submit an
application for an early determination with the Board and a hearing
date will then be set. The landlord must notify all tenants effected
at least 30 days before the scheduled hearing date and provide
them with a copy of the application. At the hearing, all sides will
have the opportunity to be heard, and then the Board will make a
determination. Upon completion of the improvement, the landlord
will submit appropriate documentation demonstrating that the
improvement was completed in accordance with the specifications
previously submitted to the Board and that the total cost of the
improvement has been paid. The Board will then schedule another
hearing date, at which the surcharge will be granted if all of the
information submitted to the Board at the early determination
hearing remains unchanged. All of the tenants effected shall again
be given notice by the landlord at least 30 days in advance of this
hearing date.
E. Mandated expenditure surcharge. [Amended 5-1-1989]
(1) A landlord shall be entitled to a surcharge representing each
tenant's proportionate share of new expenditures mandated by new
federal, state, county or municipal laws, ordinances or regulations.
Such surcharges shall be payable in 12 equal monthly payments
and shall be calculated by dividing the cost of the expenditure by
the number of units in the dwelling.
(2) To obtain a mandated expenditure surcharge, the landlord must
make application to the Board at least 60 days in advance of the
proposed effective date of the surcharge, but in no event later than
six months from the date of the expenditure. The Board shall then
establish a hearing date. Ten days prior to the hearing date, the
owner shall notify all tenants who would receive an increase in
gross rent if the requested mandated expenditure surcharge was to
be granted. Notice shall be by certified mail, return receipt
requested, or by personal service, certified either by affidavit or by
acknowledgment of service. Said notice and application shall
include the following:
(a) The date, time and location of the hearing.
§ 268-6 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 268-6
262:1110
§ 268-7. Rent Leveling Board.
(b) The amount of the expenditure.
(c) The law, ordinance or regulation requiring such expenditure.
(d) The number of units in the dwelling.
(e) The total monthly mandated expenditure surcharge and
monthly gross rent to be charged the tenant if the request is
granted.
(3) Following the hearing, the Board shall grant or deny the request for
the mandated expenditure surcharge.
(4) The surcharge granted hereunder shall not exceed 3% of the
tenant's base rent in effect at the time of the granting of the
surcharge.
(5) Surcharges granted hereunder shall not be considered as base rent
in calculating future annual rent increases.
A. There is hereby created a Rent Leveling Board within the Township of
North Brunswick. [Amended 3-18-2019 by Ord. No. 19-05]
B. The Board shall consist of seven members appointed by the Mayor, one
of whom shall be the Director of Community Development who shall
serve as Chairperson, two landlords owning property in the township or
their representatives, two tenants residing in the township, one owner
of a manufactured home park in the township, and one resident from a
manufactured home park in the township. There shall also be two
alternate members, one of whom shall be a landlord and one of whom
shall be a tenant. All appointments shall be made for three-year terms
and any existing appointment which is terminated during the pendency
of a term shall be filled by a qualified member of the same class for the
remainder of the unexpired term. To achieve staggered terms, the
initial terms of office shall be one, two and three years to be designated
by the Mayor in making the appointment. [Amended 1-15-1990;
3-18-2019 by Ord. No. 19-05]
C. Attendance by four members or alternates without regard to class shall
constitute a quorum. In the event a regular member does not attend a
meeting, the alternate member for that category shall have all of the
powers of a regular member for that meeting. Passage of any motion
requires an affirmative vote by a majority of members present and
requires a minimum of four affirmative votes with the chair voting only
in the case of tie. [Amended 8-3-1987; 1-15-1990; 3-18-2019 by
Ord. No. 19-05]
D. The Rent Leveling Board is hereby granted and shall have and exercise,
in addition to other powers therein granted, all powers necessary and
§ 268-6 REFRIGERATORS, ABANDONED § 268-7
262:1111
§ 268-8. Hardship rent increases.
appropriate to carry out and execute the purposes of this chapter,
including but not limited to the following:
(1) To recommend rules to the Township Council, which will adopt
regulations governing the operation of the Board and its powers.
(2) To supply information and assistance to landlords and tenants to
help them comply with the provisions of this chapter.
(3) To hold hearings and adjudicate applications from landlords for
additional rental as determined by §§ 268-6 and 268-8 of this
article. [Amended 8-3-1987]
(4) To hold hearings and adjudicate applications from tenants for
reduced rental as determined by §§ 268-6, 268-9 and 268-10 of this
article. [Amended 8-3-1987]
(5) To request experts to be provided by the Township Council in order
to help render decisions.
(6) To require that certain rental information be furnished by every
landlord within the borders of the Township of North Brunswick
who is presently renting or who has dwelling units available to rent,
regardless of whether the units in question are presently subject to
other provisions of this article and to impose those sanctions
enumerated under § 268-13 of this article necessary to obtain this
information. [Added 8-5-1985; amended 8-3-1987]
E. The Rent Leveling Board shall give 10 days' written notice of a hearing
to both landlord and tenant except as provided in §§ 268-6 and 268-8C.
[Amended 8-3-1987]
F. The Rent Leveling Board shall render a written decision within 45 days
after the conclusion of presentment of all evidence and testimony.
G. The Rent Leveling Board shall continue to function during the effective
term of this article and shall act as hearing tribunal concerning
landlord-tenant disputes under this article.
H. Any harassment by a landlord or tenant as defined by N.J.S.A. 2C:33-4 is
hereby prohibited, and as such the landlord or tenant may seek the
remedies provided by law.
A. A landlord may apply to the Rent Leveling Board for an increment in
rent due to hardship on the grounds that he is not receiving a just and
reasonable rate of return on his investment when that investment is
compared to other similar types of investment. To be just and
reasonable, a rate of return must be high enough to encourage good
management including adequate maintenance of services, to furnish a
reward for efficiency, to discourage the flight of capital from the rental
housing market, and to enable operators to maintain and support their
§ 268-7 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 268-8
262:1112
credit. The Board shall scrutinize all hardship applications for selfinduced
hardship.
B. The original application, plus 15 duplicates, shall provide in detail
financial and ownership information to be completed by the applicant
on a form to be furnished by the Rent Leveling Board.
C. The Rent Leveling Board, upon at least 30 days' notice to the landlord,
shall hold a public hearing on the landlord's application. At least 20
days prior to the public hearing, the landlord shall notify each tenant of
said hearing by regular mail or by personal service. The notification
shall include the date, place and time of the hearing and the substance
of the landlord's application. An affidavit of service shall be filed with
the Board showing compliance with the notice provision above. The
Rent Leveling Board shall either grant or deny a hardship rental
increase within 45 days after the conclusion of presentment of all
evidence and testimony.
D. If the services of a financial consultant are necessary to assist the Board
in evaluating accounting data, the financial consultant's fee shall be
funded through an escrow account required of landlords making
hardship appeals. The escrow may not be more than $1,000 for a
landlord of 100 or more units, $500 for a landlord of 10 to 99 units and
$200 for a landlord of less than 10 units. Any money not required for
consulting fee shall be refunded to the landlord.
E. The Board shall not grant a hardship increase if it finds that:
(1) The conditions sought to be cured by the hardship increase were
caused by sustained and systematic neglect on the part of the
landlord over a period of time during which the landlord had the
resources available to properly maintain his property.
(2) The landlord has failed, without just cause, to supply any data
required by the Board.
(3) The landlord has practiced poor or improper management.
F. The Board may condition the grant of a hardship increase on the
applicant's compliance with such reasonable terms as are consistent
with the laws of North Brunswick and the laws or Constitution of the
State of New Jersey and the United States of America. The Board is
further empowered to order such inspections and investigations as are
necessary to confirm compliance with said conditions.
G. If the Board finds that the landlord is receiving an insufficient return on
his investment, that his lack of return has not been due to poor
management practices or extraordinary nonrecurring expenses and
that the same conditions would persist without an increase in total rent,
then it may authorize an increase in total rent.

date of this article shall contain the following statement in boldface
type on the first page of the lease: "This dwelling is controlled by the

the percentage increase in the consumer price index from March of
the present year, subject to not exceeding a maximum base rent of
$425 per month. However, the owner may increase rents by a
lesser amount. Any such increase, if applicable, shall be effective
upon renewal for base periods commencing on and after the first
day of September immediately following the March-to-March
period for which the CPI increase was calculated. Only one such
rental increase can be exacted upon any one tenant within any one
year at any one manufactured home site. For a subsequent twoyear
period beginning September 1, 1994, the monthly base rent
may increase any an amount not to exceed 100% of the percentage

represented by such increase.
(e) The total gross rent, including the annual increase in base rent.
(2) The failure of the owner to provide the tenant with this information

the owner/operator must satisfy the Board that he is an efficient
operator of the manufactured home park, that the park is in a safe
and sanitary condition and that the park complies with all township

(4) Following the public hearing, if the Board is satisfied that the
applicant is an efficient landlord and that a hardship increase is
necessary in order to realize a just and reasonable rate of return on
the owner's investment, the Board may grant a hardship rent
increase sufficient to ensure said return.

item considered as such under the federal internal revenue
enactments and regulations.
(3) An owner seeking a capital improvements surcharge shall apply to

provided with an opportunity to approve or disapprove said capital
improvement. Notice of a meeting to vote on said improvement
shall be by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal
service certified either by an affidavit or by an acknowledgment of
service executed by the person served. Notification shall be a

improvement shall not be eligible for a capital improvements
surcharge.
(4) Any increase granted by authority of this section shall be paid over
the period of the useful life of the completed capital improvement,
as established by the Board at public hearing.

owner shall notify all tenants who would receive an increase in
gross rent if the requested capital improvements surcharge was to
be granted. Said notice shall include the following:
(a) The date, time and location of the hearing.
(b) The total cost of the completed capital improvement.
(c) The number of useful years of life of the improvement.

the manufactured home park.)
(e) The capital improvements surcharge being sought from each
tenant.
(2) Following the public hearing, the Board may grant a capital
improvements surcharge in an amount determined to be
appropriate.
A. Criteria for mandated expenditures surcharge. An owner of a
manufactured home park shall be entitled to a surcharge representing
each tenant's proportionate share of new expenditures mandated by
new federal, state, county or municipal laws, ordinances or regulations.
Such surcharge shall be payable in 12 equal payments owing monthly
and shall be equal to an amount calculated by dividing the cost of the
expenditure by the number of spaces occupied and available for
occupancy at the time the expenditure was made. However, any
surcharge granted hereunder shall not exceed 3% of the tenant's base
rent in effect at the time of the granting of the surcharge. Additional
spaces which are made available after the expenditure shall not have

amount.
A. Criteria for reduction.
(1) Every owner/operator shall maintain substantially the same
standards of service, maintenance, recreational facilities and
landscaping connected with the tenancy as was provided at the
inception of the tenancy. A failure on the part of the owner/operator
to properly maintain the grounds or services may entitle the
manufactured home tenant to withhold rent. The obligation of the
tenant to pay the approved gross rent in its entirety is dependent
upon the owner's continuing ability to provide substantially the
same level of services and property maintenance which were being
provided upon execution of the lease.
(2) Should minimum property maintenance livability standards not be
maintained by an owner/operator, or should facilities and services
which were provided upon execution of the lease be substantially
reduced by the owner/operator, or should the failure of the owner/
operator to make necessary repairs or improvements result in the
failure of the manufactured home park to comply with federal, state
or local codes, then tenants so affected shall be entitled to a
reduction in rent until such time as the deficiency has been
corrected.
B. Procedure for reduction.
(1) Any tenant or group of tenants who is affected by either a failure of
the owner/operator to comply with township codes or by a
reduction in standards of maintenance and services may, on 30
days' prior written notice to the owner by certified mail, return

of fact, shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $500. A violation
affecting more than one rental space shall be considered a separate

service to the Board, ask the Board to determine the percentage
reduction in the gross rent in view of the deficiency. The Board,
after hearing, shall determine the percentage reduction in rent by
using the following suggestive, but not exhaustive, guidelines:
(a) The extent of violations of applicable codes.
(b) The nature of the deficiency or extent of the reduction in
service.
(c) Whether the owner knew or should have known of the
condition.
(d) The potential or actual effects upon safety and sanitation.
(e) The length of time of the existence of the condition has existed.
(2) Upon finding that a rent reduction is in order, the tenant(s) shall
only be required to apply the rent as determined by the Board until
such time as the owner proves to the Board that the deficiency has
been corrected. Said payment shall constitute fulfillment of the
tenant's payment obligation during that time. Where a reduction in
rent has been ordered for a past deficiency, the tenant shall be
entitled to a credit against the rent(s) next due, as reduced by any
continuing deficiency which may be found by the Board, until such
times the total credit has been exhausted.

water meter attached thereto, the owner thereof shall install at his own
expense, at the intake of the water supply, a meter of a type approved by the
Sewer Department of the Township of North Brunswick for the purpose of
measuring the amount of water used therein, which amount shall constitute
the measurement of the amount of sewage for the purpose of determining
the rental charge due to the Township of North Brunswick for the use of the
connecting sanitary sewer.
§ 276-12. Determining the amount of industrial or commercial
wastes.
Each industry discharging industrial waste into the sewer system of the
Township of North Brunswick shall install a suitable metering device,
approved by the Sewer Department of the Township of North Brunswick,
which meter shall continuously record the industrial waste flow discharged
into the sewer system for the purpose of measuring the amount of such
waste discharged. The rental charge due to the Township of North
Brunswick shall be computed on the basis of the readings recorded on said
metering device. Where the total annual charge for discharging industrial
waste is estimated to be less than $1,000, then no meter shall be required
and the volume of flow shall be determined on the basis of the metered
water consumption as aforesaid.
§ 276-13. Schedule of discharge of industrial wastes.
Each industry discharging industrial waste into the sewer system of the
Township of North Brunswick shall adopt a schedule of discharges of such
waste, which schedule is subject to the approval of the Sewer Department
of the Township of North Brunswick, to the end that peak concentrations of
sewage flows shall be minimized, giving due consideration to the capacities
of the sewer system and to the necessities of factory production.
§ 276-14. Change of discharge operations. [Amended 4-16-1962]
A. In the event that the industrial waste discharged by any industry
interferes with the efficiency of the operation of the sewer system of the
Township of North Brunswick or with the disposal of the sewage flowing
therein, or unduly increases the cost of the operation of said system,
then such industry shall be required by the Sewer Department of the
Township of North Brunswick to:
(1) Reduce its peak discharge;
(2) Construct equalizing tank;
(3) Partially pretreat the waste;
(4) Eliminate troublesome waste; or
(5) Use any approved means,

industry, upon notice from the Township Sewer Department, shall
immediately install a recording pH meter, the type and installation of
which shall first be approved by the Township consulting engineers.
The meter readings shall determine acceptability of such waste in
accordance with standards set up by § 276-2 concerning prohibited
discharges. Said meter shall be so installed as to make it readily
accessible for inspection or reading at any time by a representative of
the North Brunswick Township Sewer Department.
A. Industrial wastes. Each industry discharging industrial waste into the
sewer system of the Township of North Brunswick shall provide
facilities and means whereby the waste being discharged may be
inspected by designated employees of the Township of North Brunswick
for the purpose of determining the character of the waste, its
concentration and its rate of flow. Determination of character,
concentration and rate of flow by the Sewer Department of the
Township shall be binding for the purpose of computing applicable
charges, fees and/or fines. Samples may be collected and evaluated,
pursuant to standard methods of analyses, for the purpose of
determining the quality and quantity of such industrial waste.

routed around the trap/interceptor or cooled to below said temperature
before entering the trap/interceptor.
C. Pretreatment of waste from FOG generators. Any establishments,
except for private residential dwellings, that generate FOG shall, at
their sole cost and expense, pretreat their waste with a Townshipapproved
bacteriological product in a manner and dosage approved by
the Township for the purpose of controlling and eliminating the
introduction of FOG into the Township's sewers. This includes but is not
limited to all retail food establishments, commercial food processors,
meat processors or similar food processors or food service
establishments, including schools, churches, banquet halls, clubs and/
or other social or charitable associations, athletic facility food facilities,
and/or any other private or commercial establishment that periodically
prepares food for more than 25 persons in any one day.
(1) The bacteriological product must be free of wetting agents,
surfactants, reducing agents and other additives, enzymes,
solvents, and chemical degreasers and must be approved by the
Township's Director of Public Works or his designee prior to
application and/or installation of the feeding equipment or the start
of application of the bacteriological product. The bacteriological
product shall be introduced into the waste system upstream from
the grease trap/interceptor once in every twenty-four-hour period
or as directed by the Director of Public Works or his designee after
the closing of business or during the period of time with the least
business activity (at the beginning of the period of time with the
least wastewater for the longest time). If the establishment fails to
apply the bacteriological product correctly or sufficiently, the
Township of North Brunswick shall have the right to require the
use of an automated feed system or extended release block
bacteriological product, regardless of whether such feed system or
block increases the cost of treatment. Chemicals, cleaners,
undiluted bleach or other disinfectants that are toxic to the
bacteria being added must not be allowed to enter the grease trap/
interceptor unless otherwise required by law.

(3) The traffic reduction plan shall be designed, for each year after the
complex becomes occupied, to reduce that year's anticipated peak
hour automobile trips to 70% of the projected peak hour vehicle
trips, based on professionally provided trip projections as
presented in the traffic reduction plan approved at the time of site
plan approval. These maximum vehicle usage goals shall be
maintained after building occupancy commences, regardless of the
variation between projected trip generation and the actual trip
generation. Subsequent annual vehicle reduction targets shall be
§ 316-5 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § 316-6
316:1228
calculated as the difference between the initial vehicle reduction
goal and the actual vehicle trips generated by the site employment
as revealed in the annual report.

approval within 45 days of submission unless the OTM determines
that said plan as designed cannot achieve required traffic reduction
goals. If such a determination is made, the OTM shall recommend
that the Planning Board not accept the plan and require that said
plan be revised.
B. Continued existence of traffic coordinator. Any nonresidential
development which exceeds 100,000 square feet shall continue to
provide a traffic coordinator on a permanent basis.

ongoing traffic management services and provide annual surveys to
the OTM of all businesses occupying the premises.
(2) An annual report on the effectiveness of the plan, as updated, shall
be submitted to the OTM. Failure to achieve the intended levels of
trip reduction will be grounds for review and revision of any
previously approved plans or other remedies as allowed under
§ 316-8.
§ 316-6 TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT § 316-6
316:1229
§ 316-7. Waiver for exceptional difficulties.
Where, by reason of the nature of a particular business or operation or
the location, nature or circumstances affecting a particular proposed new
development, measures required to achieve the traffic reduction goals
specified herein would entail exceptional practical difficulties to an existing
business or developer, the OTM may grant, upon submission of a traffic
reduction plan and accompanying application for relief hereunder, a waiver
from the traffic reduction goals required herein. In granting such a waiver,
the OTM shall require a traffic reduction plan which furthers the intent and
purpose of this chapter as much as is practicable, given the circumstances.
(3) It shall be a condition of site plan approval that all new businesses
which occupy 15,000 square feet or more of gross building area be
notified that they are individually required to comply with the
survey requirements of § 316-4A of this chapter within five months
of occupancy. Subsequent occupants of 15,000 square feet or more
shall be required to submit annual reports in accordance with the
requirements of § 316-4B, unless a waiver is granted by the OTM
for good cause shown. Developers or subsequent owners shall be
required to submit the names of all businesses leasing 15,000
square feet or more in a building or complex to the OTM.
D. Transition from new development to existing business. If, upon
submission of its first required annual report, a new business owning or
leasing 15,000 square feet or more can document that it employs fewer
than 50 employees in the Township of North Brunswick, said business
shall be exempted from the requirements of this chapter. Said business
shall thereafter reapply for exemption each year by March 15.
E. Maintenance of traffic reduction measures in complexes. Developers or
subsequent owners of complexes, as defined in this chapter, shall be
responsible for assuring ongoing impact on traffic reduction goals from
the facilities, services, incentives and/or activities included in the traffic
reduction plan incorporated in the site plan approval. This requirement
will not preclude the developer from providing alternate but
commensurate traffic reduction facilities, services, incentives or
activities found or expected to be more successful in meeting the
vehicle reduction requirement. Revisions to the selected facilities,
services, incentives or activities should be made via the annual report
to the OTM. Approval for the revision of the traffic reduction plan shall
not be unreasonably withheld by the OTM.
F. Special information requirements for warehousing and distribution
developments. All existing and proposed ware housing and distribution
facilities in excess of 20,000 square feet shall be required to provide an
annual report to the OTM indicating the average number of trucks

Domestic service provides water for domestic, commercial or industrial use
other than for fire suppression, and fire service provides water for fire
suppression. The installation of water service lines and water meters shall
use the construction materials specified herein and shall be constructed as
follows, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Utility:
A. Submission of plans and records. The applicant for a new water service
or change in size of water service must provide the Utility with a copy of
the design drawing and design details of the installation. Installation of
the service line must be in accordance with the submitted drawing. Any
changes in the service line's design, such as due to underground
obstructions, must be approved by the Utility and a record drawing of
the final design submitted to the Utility. The location of the tap and
service line from the water main up to the curbline or property edge
must be accurately shown (within one foot) on the design drawing or, if
the installation is different from the design drawing, on the final record
drawing.
B. Taps and service line size. The domestic water service line and fire
service line to a property may be separate or combined (separate taps
and service lines from the water main or a single tap and combined fire
and domestic service line from the water main that splits into separate
fire service and domestic service lines prior to and near the building
line). Taps for two-inch and smaller lines should be made 60° above
horizontal. The minimum tap size is one inch. Fire lines must be two
inches (minimum size) or four inches and larger. Fire service and
domestic service lines of three inches are not permitted. The service
line from the water main must be equal to or larger than the size of the
tap and remain that size to the fire meter, if a combined fire and
domestic service line is used, or the fire meter or domestic meter, as
applicable, if separate service lines are used. The property owner is
responsible for having a qualified professional determine the sizes of
the fire and domestic service lines, or the combined fire and domestic
service line, in accordance with all applicable regulations, codes and
insurance or other requirements.
C. Curb valves; valve box covers. For service lines that provide only
domestic service or only fire service, install the curb valve 18 inches
behind the curb or edge of the property. For combined fire and domestic
service lines, install both the domestic service curb valve and fire
service curb valve within six feet of the building line and within six feet
of each other, following the connection tee to split the domestic and fire
services. The valve boxes of tapping valves, gate valves and curb valves
on service lines or portions thereof providing only domestic service or
combined fire and domestic service shall have metal valve box covers
with the word "Water" cast into them. The valve boxes of tapping valves,
gate valves and curb valves on service lines providing only fire service
shall have valve box covers with the word "Fire" cast into them,
§ 352-24 VENDING MACHINES, COIN-OPERATED § 352-24
342:1345
including the curb valve on a fire service line after it splits off of a
combined fire and domestic service line.
D. Service line connections and fittings. There may be no connections to
any water service line prior to any water meter used for billing
consumption with the one exception of the connection tee to split fire
and domestic services off of a combined fire and domestic service line.
There may be no bypasses of domestic water meters, detector checks
(other than the required bypass meter) or fire meters without written
approval of the Utility. Victaulic fittings are not allowed. Copper service
lines must be continuous from valve to valve (no connections or fittings
except the connection tee to split fire and domestic service off of a twoinch
combined fire and domestic service line) up to the maximum length
commercially available.

Department shall be by rotation. The Department shall maintain four

miscellaneous; 3) heavy-duty motor vehicle accident; and 4) heavy-duty

within said list. When, however, the owner or driver of the disabled
motor vehicle indicates a choice of a specific wrecker owner, that
wrecker owner should be called, and no wrecker shall be assigned from
the rotating list.
B. The rotation system shall be conducted in the following manner:
(1) The Township Clerk shall compile four lists of all licensees as
provided in this chapter designated as follows:
(a) Light duty.

vehicle weight of 12,000 pounds or less towed as a result
of a motor vehicle accident.
[2] Light-duty miscellaneous: vehicles having a gross vehicle
weight of 12,000 pounds or less towed for impounds,

address, telephone number and maximum towing fees shall be
printed and circulated in the municipality or county as appropriate.
The annual reporting of the list shall be available for inspection by
any member of the general public upon request and during regular
business hours.
(3) Each owner, lessee or bailee of a wrecker licensed hereunder shall
be placed on an initial call list, for light-duty motor vehicle
accident, light-duty miscellaneous, heavy-duty motor vehicle,
heavy-duty miscellaneous, or all if heavy-duty, based upon the date
on which the license is issued and upon the classification of the
wrecker. Where an owner, lessee or bailee shall own or lease more
than one wrecker classified for light-duty which shall be assigned
to the same areas, said owner's, lessee's or bailee's name shall
appear but once on said call list.
(4) Whenever the Police Department or any other department
summons a wrecker, the owner, lessee or bailee at the beginning of
the list for the area concerned will be called. After being
summoned, such owner, lessee or bailee shall be placed at the end
of such list, whether or not said owner, lessee or bailee responds to
the call. Thereafter, the next licensee shall be called until the
rotation is completed.
C. Additional rules and regulations regarding the rotation of wreckers as
may be promulgated hereunder by the Township Clerk shall take effect
immediately after service of a copy thereof to all holders of licenses for
wreckers in the Township, which may be made by addressing the same
to the licensees by mail at their last known addresses. If, pursuant to
the rules and regulations for rotation of wreckers adopted under this
chapter, the Police Department summons a wrecker to the scene of an
accident for the purpose of removing a vehicle and the owner of the
disabled vehicle declines to use the services of the wrecker summoned
and indicates that he or she prefers to have the vehicle handled by
another wrecker, the officer in charge shall authorize the summoned
wrecker to go to the garage designated by the owner of the disabled
vehicle. In any event, the summoned wrecker shall be entitled to collect
towing charges from either the owner of the disabled vehicle or the
owner of the garage to which the vehicle is towed at the discretion of its
owner.
D. A wrecker company that cannot respond when called shall not have any
other wrecker company, whether on the rotation list or not, respond in
its place. The next wrecker on the list shall be called to respond by the
Police Department.

such cat is free of rabies; provided, however, if any cat has received
antirabic treatment under the direction of the enforcement authority or a
licensed veterinarian within one year prior to the time that it has bitten
or abraded the skin of a human being, such cat may, in the discretion of
the enforcement authority, be quarantine into the care of its owner for
a period of not less than 10 days from the day of the bite or abrasion;
provided further that this section shall not be construed as preventing
the enforcement authority, where necessary, from quarantining the animals
referred to herein, so long as prior to such animal's release an examination
shall be made by a licensed veterinarian and a written report thereof be
transmitted to the enforcement authority.
B. Before the enforcement authority shall release said cat from detention
and if the cat so seized shall have been licensed and registered, the
owner or other person shall produce proof of such licensing and
registration; or if the cat shall not have been licensed and registered,
said owner or other person shall otherwise produce such evidence of
ownership or custody as may be deemed sufficient by the enforcement
authority.
C. Additionally, the enforcement authority shall not release any
impounded cat to such owner or other person unless and until such
owner or other person shall have paid to the Township of North

or notice cannot be given as set forth in said § 381-11 for a period of
seven days after its seizure. If after such respective periods of
detention, no person has claimed the cat or will pay the charges
required hereunder, the enforcement authority may cause the cat to be
destroyed in a manner causing as little pain as possible or to place the
cat with some responsible person desiring the cat as a household pet.
But the enforcement authority may sooner dispose of any cat, whether
or not the owner is known or whether it is licensed, if said cat is so ill or
injured as to justify such disposal. Prior to such actions, the owner shall
be notified, if known, and given the opportunity to provide any special
euthanizing instructions to the Animal Control Officer, which
instructions should be carried out at the expense of the owner.

The Township hereby grants to Cablevision its nonexclusive consent to

accordance with N.J.S.A 48:5A-16, and applicable state and federal rules
and regulations. In accordance with N.J.S.A. 48:5A-25.1, both the Township

such time as Cablevision converts the municipal consent (and any certificate
of approval) into a system-wide franchise.

equal to 2% of the actual gross revenues received from all recurring
charges in the nature of subscription fees paid by subscribers for its cable
television reception services in the Township. In the event applicable law
hereinafter permits a larger franchise fee to be collected, but does not fix

franchise fee by Cablevision that is higher than the fee paid by all other
cable television service providers offering service in the municipality.

§ A433-15. Liability insurance.
Cablevision agrees to maintain and keep in force and effect at its sole cost
at all times during the term of this consent, sufficient liability insurance
naming the Township as an additional insured and insuring against loss

amounts of $500,000 for bodily injury or death to one person, and
$1,000,000 for bodily injury or death resulting from any one accident or
occurrence stemming from or arising out of the company's exercise of its
rights hereunder.
C. Upon request of a person holding a building or moving permit issued by
the Township, the company shall temporarily move or remove
appropriate parts of its facilities so as to permit the moving or erection
of buildings or for the performance of other work. The expense of any

B. Cablevision shall implement a senior citizen discount in the amount of
10% off the monthly broadcast basic level of cable television service

television services provided by the company, subject to the following:
(1) Such discount shall only be available to eligible senior citizens who
do not share the subscription with more than one person in the
same household who is less than 62 years of age;
(2) In accordance with N.J.S.A. 48:5A-11.2, subscribers seeking

consent granted herein to a system-wide franchise in accordance with
N.J.S.A. 48:5A-25.1; or upon Board approval of a certification that
another cable television service provider offering services to residents
of the Township files, in accordance with N.J.S.A. 48:5A-30(d), that it is
capable of serving 60% or more of the households within the Township.
In the event the company does cease providing a senior discount
pursuant to this provision, it shall comply with all notice requirements
of applicable law.
§ A433-16 POLICE DEPARTMENT RULES AND § A433-18
A432:1431
The company shall in no way be held liable for any injury suffered by
the Township or any other person, during an emergency, if for any reason
the municipality is unable to make full use of the cable television system
as contemplated herein. The Township shall utilize the state-approved
procedures for such emergency uses.
§ A433-19. Equitable terms.
§ A433-20. Removal of facilities.
Upon expiration, termination or revocation of this chapter, Cablevision at
its sole cost and expense and upon direction of the Board, shall remove the
cables and appurtenant devices constructed or maintained in connection
with the cable services authorized herein, unless Cablevision, its affiliated
entities or assignees should, within six months after such expiration,
termination or revocation, obtain certification from the FCC to operate an
open video system or any other federal or state certification to provide
telecommunications.
§ A433-21. Public, educational, and governmental access.
A. In the event that the service of another multichannel video program
provider not subject to the Township's regulatory authority within the
Township creates a significant competitive disadvantage to Cablevision,
the company shall have the right to request from the Township lawful
amendments to its franchise that relieve it of burdens which create the
unfair competitive situation. Should the company seek such
amendments to its Franchise, the parties agree to negotiate in good
faith appropriate changes to the Franchise in order to relieve the
company of such competitive disadvantages. If the parties can reach an
agreement on such terms, the Township agrees to support the
company's petition to the Board for modification of the consent in
accordance with N.J.S.A 48:5A-47 and N.J.A.C. 14:17-6.7.
B. If the parties are unable to reach an agreement on appropriate
amendments to the franchise, the Township acknowledges that the
company shall have the right to petition the Board directly for such
amendments in accordance with N.J.S.A. 48:5A-47 and N.J.A.C.
14:17-6.7; provided, however, the Township shall be under no obligation
to support Cablevision's request for such relief from the Board.
C. In any subsequent municipal consent, the Township shall require, at a
minimum, the same terms and conditions of any other provider of
multichannel video programming subject to the Township's regulatory
authority as those contained in the instant consent. In the event such
subsequent consent does not contain the same terms and conditions as
the instant consent, Township agrees to support the company's petition
to the Board for modification of the consent in accordance with N.J.S.A.
48:5A-47 and N.J.A.C. 14:17-6.7 to relieve the company of competitive
disadvantages identified in the company's petition.
§ A433-18 NORTH BRUNSWICK CODE § A433-21
A432:1432
A. Cablevision shall continue to make available noncommercial public,
educational and governmental (PEG) access services to the residents of
the Township as described in the application for municipal consent. All
Cablevision support for PEG access shall be for the exclusive benefit of

B. The Township agrees that Cablevision shall retain the right to use the
PEG access channel, or portion thereof, for non-PEG access
programming, during times when the Township is not utilizing the
channel for purposes of providing PEG access programming. In the
event that the company uses said PEG access channel for the
presentation of such other programming, the PEG programming shall
remain the priority use and the company's rights with respect to using
the channel for non-PEG programming shall be subordinate to the
Township's provision of PEG access programming on such channel.
C. Cablevision shall continue to provide and maintain one fiber access
return feed at each of the following two locations: Township Hall (710
Hermann Road); and North Brunswick Township High School (1436 US
Highway 130). The Township shall use said return feeds exclusively for
noncommercial public, education and government access programming
in the cable system.
D. If, during the term of this Agreement, the PEG access channel provided
to the Township by Cablevision carries original, nontext, nonduplicative
programming for at least 50% of the time between 10:00 a.m. and 10:00
p.m. for 12 consecutive weeks, the Township shall have the right to
request an additional PEG access channel. Upon receipt of such
request, Cablevision shall make such additional PEG access channel
available within 120 days. In the event the additional PEG access
channel provided to the Township fails to carry original, nontext,
nonduplicative programming for at least 25% of the time between 10:00
a.m. and 10:00 p.m. within one year of being provided to the Township,
or at any time thereafter for 12 consecutive weeks, such additional PEG
access channel shall revert to Cablevision for its sole and exclusive use
after Cablevision provides the Township 90 days advance notice of such
reversion.
E. Cablevision shall have discretion to determine the format and method
of transmission of the PEG access programming provided for in this
section.
F. In consideration of the rights granted in this chapter, Cablevision shall
provide the Township with a one-time PEG grant of up to $110,000
payable as follows: an initial grant payment of $45,600 within 60 days
of the issuance of the Certificate of Approval by the Board of Public
Utilities (the "Initial Grant"); and two grants of $4,600 each provided in
annual installments upon written request by the Township (the "Annual
Grant"). The Annual Grant shall be payable to the Township within 90
days from receipt of the Township's annual written request. Cablevision

chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of

such written notice.
shall not be obligated to make any additional payments beyond year 15

support of PEG access programming, such as the purchase and/or
rental of PEG access equipment and facilities. On request, the Township
shall provide Cablevision with a certification of compliance with this
section.
H. The company shall have no further obligation to provide any PEG grant
payments due and payable after the date upon which the Company
converts the municipal consent granted herein to a system-wide
franchise in accordance with N.J.S.A. 48:5A-25.1.
