(f) Vacancies that occur on the board of aldermen (other than vacancies in the office

with the provisions of G.S. 160A-63, except that whenever a seat on the board of
aldermen (other than that of the mayor) becomes vacant at a time when one year
or more of the term of office of that seat remains unexpired, the board of
aldermen may instead adopt a resolution pursuant to G.S. 163-287 calling for a

(g) If the board of aldermen adopts a resolution calling for a special election to fill
one or more vacant seats as provided in subsection (f) of this section, and the
resolution sets as the date of such election the same date as municipal general
election, then the resolution shall provide that the same filing period, filing fee,
and absentee voting period that are applicable to the three seats on the board
whose terms are expiring shall also apply to the special election for the vacant
seat or seats. If the resolution sets as the date of such election concurrent with an
election other than the municipal general election, then the resolution shall
prescribe the filing period and the filing fee. If the resolution sets as the date of
such election a date other than the same date as another election, then the
resolution shall prescribe the filing period, filing fee, and absentee voting period
for such special election, including an alternative location for one-stop absentee
voting within the corporate limits of the municipality, rather than the office of the
board of elections, if no other elections are conducted within the county on the
same date. [Added by Ch. SL 2007-270 on 07/27/2007, Amend. By SL 2013-

Article 6. Capital Facilities Fees
Part 1. Impact Fees
Section 6-1. Impact Fees Authorized.
(a) The board of aldermen may provide by ordinance for a system of impact fees to
be paid by developers to help defray the costs to the town of constructing certain
capital improvements, the need for which is created in substantial part by the new
development that takes place within the town and its extraterritorial planning area.
(b) For purposes of this part, the term capital improvements includes capital
improvements to public streets, bridges, sidewalks, and on and off street surface
water drainage ditches, pipes, culverts, and other drainage facilities.
(c) An ordinance adopted under this part may be made applicable to all development
that occurs within the town and its extraterritorial planning area, as established by
local act or pursuant to the procedures set forth in G.S. 160A-360.
(d) The town may, with the approval of the Orange County Board of Commissioners,
construct capital improvements outside the town limits but within the town’s
extraterritorial planning area and may cooperate with the State in the construction
of capital improvements to State highway system streets within this area as well
as within the town.
Section 6-2. Amount of Fees.
(a) In establishing the amount of any impact fee, the town shall endeavor to approach
the objective of having every development contribute to a capital improvements
fund an amount of revenue that bears a reasonable relationship to that
development’s fair share of the costs of the capital improvements that are needed
in part because of that development. In fulfilling this objective the Board of
Aldermen shall, among other steps and actions:
(1) Estimate the total cost of improvements by category (e.g., streets,
sidewalks, drainage ways, etc.) that will be needed to provide in a
reasonable manner for the public health, safety and welfare of persons
residing within the town and its extraterritorial planning area during a
reasonable planning period not to exceed 20 years and that, consistent with
the objectives set forth herein, ought to be paid for at least in part by
impact fees. The Board may divide the town and its extraterritorial area
into two or more districts and estimate the costs of needed improvements
within each district. These estimates shall be periodically reviewed and
updated, and the planning period used may be changed from time to time.
Last Updated June 18, 2013 19
(2) Establish a percentage of the total costs of each category of improvements
that, in keeping with the objective set forth above, should fairly be borne
by those paying the impact fee.
(3) Establish a formula that fairly and objectively apportions the total costs
that are to be borne by those paying the impact fees among various types
of developments. By way of illustration without limitation:
a. In the case of street improvements, the impact fee may be related
to the number of trips per day generated by different types of uses
according to recognized estimates;
b. In the case of drainage improvements, the impact fee may be
related to the size of a development, the amount of impervious
surface the development has, or other factors that bear upon the
degree to which a development contributes to the need for drainage
improvements made at public expense.
Section 6-3. Capital Improvements Reserve Funds; Expenditures.
(a) Impact fees received by the town shall be deposited in a capital improvements
reserve fund or funds established under Article 3, part 2, Chapter 159 of the
General Statutes. Such funds may be expended only on the type of capital
improvements for which such impact fees were established, and then only in
accordance with the provision of subsection (b) of this section.
(b) In order to ensure that impact fees paid by a particular development are expended
on capital improvements that benefit that development, the town shall establish
for each category of capital improvement for which it collects an impact fee at
least two geographical districts or zones, and impact fees generated by
developments within those districts or zones must be spent on improvements that
are located within or that benefit property within those districts or zones.
Section 6-4. Credits for Improvements. An ordinance adopted under this part shall
make provision for credits against required fees when a developer installs improvements of a
type that generally would be paid for by the town out of a capital reserve account funded by
impact fees. The ordinance may spell out the circumstances under which a developer will be
allowed to install such improvements and receive such credits.
Section 6-5. Appeals Procedure. An ordinance adopted under this part may provide
that any person aggrieved by a decision regarding an impact fee may appeal to the Carrboro
Board of Adjustment. If the ordinance establishes an appeals procedure, it shall spell out the
time within which the appeal must be taken to the board of adjustment, the possible grounds for
an appeal and the board’s authority in the matter, whether the fee must be paid prior to resolution
of the appeal, and other procedural or substantive matters related to appeals. Any decision by the
Last Updated June 18, 2013 20
board of adjustment shall be subject to review by the superior court by proceedings in the nature

hazardous, the board may adopt an ordinance requiring the railroad company to
install and maintain such warning signs, gates, lights or devices as the board
deems reasonably necessary in the interest of public safety. The ordinance may
provide that up to seventy-five percent (75%) of the cost of the acquisition and

No Parking In Or Along Road, Violators Towed At Their Expense.’ Such

(c) What the telephone number is that should be called for information
about a towed vehicle. (This information may be in letters or

pursuant to the section, a city or county governing board or administrative agency

(b) Two or more municipalities or one or more municipalities and one or more
counties may enter into binding written agreements with each other to set forth
areas or boundaries within which or beyond which one or more of the
participating municipalities will refrain from engaging in annexation (voluntary,

exceed 20 years.
(c) Before engaging in involuntary annexation, a municipality that is a party to an
agreement shall send to the chief administrative official of every other party to
such agreement a copy of the notice of intent to annex territory specified in G.S.
160A-38(a) or 160A-49(a) (as applicable). Before engaging in involuntary
annexation, a municipality that is a party to an agreement shall send to each other
party to the agreement a copy of the statutorily required notice of public hearing
on such proposed voluntary annexation. A failure to send the notice required
herein shall render any annexation undertaken in disregard of this requirement
null and void with respect to any property covered under an agreement.
(d) If, on or before the date of a public hearing on voluntary annexation, an annexing
municipality that is a party to an agreement receives from another party to such

the annexing municipality may not make the annexation effective sooner than 30
days following the date of the adoption of such ordinance.
(e) Monetary damages shall not constitute a remedy for breach of any agreement.
However, an alleged breach of such agreement may be redressed as provided in
this subsection.

that another party has adopted an involuntary annexation ordinance in
violation of the agreement may appeal the annexation in the manner set
forth in G.S. 160A-38 or G.S. 160A-50 (as appropriate), except that the
petitioning party to such an agreement need not demonstrate material
injury or prejudice beyond the violation of the agreement. If the court
concludes that the agreement has been violated, it shall, in addition to any
other appropriate remedy, remand the ordinance to the municipal
governing board for amendment of the annexation boundaries to exclude
the area included in violation of the agreement.
(2) Any party to an agreement who believes that another party has adopted a
voluntary annexation ordinance in violation of the agreement may, not
later than 30 days after the adoption of any such ordinance, file a petition
Last Updated June 18, 2013 30
in the superior court of the county in which the municipality is located
seeking review of the action of the governing board adopting such
ordinance.
a. Such petition shall explicitly state what exceptions are taken to the
action of the governing body and what relief the petitioner seeks.
Within 5 days after the petition is filed with the court, the party
seeking review shall serve copies of the petition by certified mail,
return receipt requested, upon the annexing municipality.
b. Within 15 days after receipt of the copy of the petition for review,
or within such additional time as the court may allow, the
municipality shall transmit to the reviewing court a copy of the
annexation petition as well as a copy of the annexation ordinance
and any other minutes or documents that constitute the record of
the annexation procedure.
c. The court shall fix the date for review of annexation proceedings
under this Part, which review shall preferably be within 30 days
following the date of the petition to the end that review shall be
expeditious and without unnecessary delays. The review shall be
conducted by the court without a jury. The court may hear oral
arguments and receive written briefs, and may take evidence
intended to determine whether there has been a violation of an
agreement authorized under this section.
d. If the court determines that there has been a violation of an
annexation agreement, it shall declare the annexation null and void
and may order any additional relief that appears appropriate.
e. If an area that has been voluntarily annexed is the subject of an
appeal to the superior court or appellate division on the effective
date of the ordinance, then the ordinance shall be deemed amended
to make the effective date with respect to such area the date of the
final judgment of the superior court or appellate division,
whichever is appropriate.

for adoption. A matter concerning which this motion has been adopted may be brought before

consideration and put the matter to a vote. This motion shall be in order at any time, but unless

APPENDIX B
CODE OF ETHICS FOR THE TOWN OF
CARRBORO BOARD OF ALDERMEN
Section 1. Purpose.
The purpose of this Code of Ethics is to establish guidelines for ethical standards of
conduct for the Board of Aldermen (the “Board”) and to help determine what conduct is
appropriate in particular cases. It should not be considered a substitute for the law or for a Board
member’s best judgment.
Section 2. General Principles Underlying the Code of Ethics.
(A) The stability and proper operation of democratic representative government
depend upon public confidence in the integrity of the government and upon responsible exercise
of the trust conferred by the people upon their elected officials.
(B) Governmental decisions and policy must be made and implemented through
proper channels and processes of the governmental structure.
(C) Board members must be able to act in a manner that maintains their integrity and
independence, yet is responsive to the interests and needs of those they represent.
(D) Board members must always remain aware that at various times they play
different roles:
(1) As advocates, who strive to advance the legitimate needs of their citizens;
(2) As legislators, who balance the public interest and private rights in
considering and enacting decisions, ordinances, and resolutions; and
(3) As decision-makers, who arrive at fair and impartial quasi-judicial and
administrative determinations.
(E) Board members must know how to distinguish among these roles, to determine
when each role is appropriate, and to act accordingly.
(F) Board members must be aware of their obligation to conform their behavior to
standards of ethical conduct that warrant the trust of their constituents. Each official must find
within his or her own conscience the touchstone by which to determine what conduct is
appropriate.
Section 3. Obey the Law.

Board members should obey all laws applicable to their official actions as members of
the Board. Board members should be guided by the spirit as well as the letter of the law in
whatever they do.
Section 4. Act with Civility.
Board members should feel free to assert policy positions and opinions without fear of
reprisal from fellow Board members or citizens. To declare that a Board member is behaving
unethically because one disagrees with that Board member on a question of policy (and not
because of the Board member’s behavior) is unfair, dishonest, irresponsible, and itself unethical.
Section 5. Maintain Integrity and Independence.
Board members should act with integrity and independence from improper influence as
they exercise the duties of their office. Characteristics and behaviors consistent with this
standard include the following:
(A) Adhering firmly to a code of sound values;
(B) Behaving consistently and with respect toward everyone with whom they interact;
(C) Exhibiting trustworthiness;
(D) Living as if they are on duty as elected officials regardless of where they are or
what they doing;
(E) Using their best independent judgment to pursue the common good as they see it,
presenting their opinions to all in a reasonable, forthright, consistent manner;
(F) Remaining incorruptible, self-governing, and unaffected by improper influence
while at the same time being able to consider the opinions and ideas of others;
(G) In a quasi-judicial matter, disclosing contacts and information about issues that
they receive outside of public meetings to the extent required by law;
(H) In a quasi-judicial matter, refraining from seeking or receiving information about
the matter outside of the quasi-judicial proceeding itself to the extent required by law;
(I) Treating other board members and the public with respect and honoring the
opinions of others even when the Board members disagree with those opinions;
(J) Not reaching conclusions on issues until all sides have been heard;
(K) Showing respect for their office and not behaving in ways that reflect badly on
those in office;
2-16
(L) Recognizing that they are part of a larger group and acting accordingly; and
(M) Recognizing that individual board members are not generally allowed to act on
behalf of the Board but may only do so if the Board specifically authorizes it, and that the Board
must take official action as a body.
Section 6. Avoid Impropriety.
(A) Board members should avoid impropriety in the exercise of their official duties.
Their official actions should be above reproach. Although opinions may vary about what
behavior is inappropriate, this Board will consider impropriety in terms of whether a reasonable
person who is aware of all of the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the Board
member’s action would conclude that the action was inappropriate.
(B) If a Board member believes that his or her actions, while legal and ethical, may be
misunderstood, the member should seek the advice of the Board’s attorney and should consider
publicly disclosing the facts of the situation and the steps taken to resolve it (such as consulting
with the attorney).
Section 7. Faithfully Perform the Duties of Office.
Board members should faithfully perform the duties of their office. They should act as
especially responsible citizens whom others can trust and respect. They should set a good
example for others in the community, keeping in mind that trust and respect must continually be
earned. Board members should faithfully attend and prepare for meetings. They should
carefully analyze all credible information properly submitted to them, and in quasi-judicial
matters they should be mindful of the need not to engage in communications outside of meetings.
They should demand full accountability from those over whom the Board has authority. Board
members should be willing to bear their fair share of the Board’s workload. To the extent
appropriate, they should be willing to put the Board’s interests ahead of their own.
Section 8. Conduct the Business of Government in an Open and Public Manner.
Board members should conduct the affairs of the Board in an open and public manner.
They should comply with all applicable laws governing open meetings and public records,
recognizing that doing so is an important way to be worthy of the public’s trust. They should
remember when they meet that they are conducting the public’s business. They should also
remember that local government records belong to the public and not to Board members or their
employees. In order to ensure strict compliance with the laws concerning openness, Board
members should make clear that an environment of transparency and candor is to be maintained
at all times in the governmental unit. They should prohibit unjustified delay in fulfilling public
records requests. They should take deliberate steps to make certain that any closed sessions held
by the Board are lawfully conducted and that such sessions do not stray from the purposes for
which they are called.

Section 3-24.6. Neighborhood Forum(Amend. 12/13/94)
(a) Preamble. As Carrboro grows in population and its boundaries expand, its citizens
seek opportunities to enlarge their circle of acquaintances as well as to feel a part of the entire
community. Expanding acquaintances and feeling a part of the Carrboro community engenders
cooperation, respect, and a sense of tradition and history that is needed amidst the diverse, mobile and
rapidly changing world challenging the citizens of Carrboro.
Neighborhoods are the home to which citizens return each day. They also serve as the natural
arena where individuals begin to engage in public discourse, identify common needs and capacities
and work for change. Neighborhoods and their health are essential to the health of Carrboro. All of
Carrboro’s neighborhoods are bound together in a mutual call to make them safe to return home to.
Civic renewal and neighborhood vitality are mutually dependent. By working together with town
government, citizens can enlarge their sense of identity beyond their individual neighborhoods, learn
about and contribute to the overall well being of the community, increase the effectiveness of
programs that need citizen cooperation, and nurture relationships between citizens and their civic
institutions so that citizens can begin to believe that Carrboro’s government is listening to its citizens.
People working together for the common good and being actively involved in local democracy can
have a direct and tangible effect on the community.
(b) Principles. The Neighborhood Forum will allow Carrboro citizens to work together for the
common good and community self determination. It will be guided in its coming together,
deliberations and consensus-building by the following ten ingredients for building community and
community problem solving, as described by John Gardner in his essay, “Building Community.”
(l) Wholeness Incorporating Diversity. Diversity in Carrboro represents a breadth
of tolerance and sympathy which allows for adaptation and renewal in a changing
world. Wholeness of community means pluralism that achieves coherence
among diverse groups which are given the right to pursue their proposes within the
law, retain their identity and share in the setting of larger goals while working and
caring for the common good of all citizens.
(2) A Reasonable Base of Shared Values. A community teaches core values about
what affects the common good and the future. The lessons that the community can
impart through its traditions, history and collective memory can form a reasonable
framework of shared values that heal and strengthen its members.
(3) Caring, Trust and Teamwork. A climate of caring, trust and teamwork, where
citizens deal with each other humanely and with respect for differences and the
value of the individual, fosters cooperation, connectedness and community.
Ways for resolving disputes and conflict should be developed not to abolish
conflict but to achieve constructive outcomes when conflicts arise.
(4) Effective Internal Communications. Fostering communication between all citizens
from different neighborhoods in a tradition of civility and common language
can reduce misunderstanding and increase effective communications within the
community.
(5) Participation. Participation allows all citizens from leaders and volunteers, children
and adults to have a role to play in the civic health of Carrboro.
(6) Affirmation. A healthy community reaffirms itself and its shared purpose by
nourishing its own morale, facing. up to its flaws and criticism, and having
confidence in itself.
(7) Links Beyond Community. Each community nests within a bigger one.
Neighborhoods nest within larger communities which nest within the town. Each
one needs to recognize its responsibility to the larger whole.
(8) Development of Young People. A community should prepare its young people for
leadership, instill shared values and foster commitment to shared purposes and a
common heritage.
(9) A Forward View. A community needs to examine where it should go and what it
may become.
(10) Institutional Arrangement for Community Maintenance. Govern-ment and
members of the community who share leadership tasks must provide community
maintenance and think of the fate of the community as a whole.
(c) Charge. In addition to using John Gardner's ten ingredients for community building
and problem solving as the framework and context for its deliberations, the Neighborhood Forum
shall:
(1) Work together with their town government to improve the quality of life in all
neighborhoods by removing barriers between neighborhoods and between
neighborhoods and town government.
(2) Serve as a means of gathering opinions through open discussion by its
membership concerning issues that affect the quality of life in neighborhoods
and to communicate those various points of view to the Mayor and Board of
Aldermen. These discussions should also develop a deeper understanding of
these issues among the neighborhoods.
(3) Assist the Mayor and Board of Aldermen in their deliberations as they may
request (e.g. providing information, opinions, and feedback on service quality,
efficiency and effectiveness of town government).
(4) Foster the need to preserve and renew the citizens' common heritage and
community stemming from residency in Carrboro.
(5) Foster the cooperation, connectedness and collaboration that sustains
community.
(6) Identify morale building activities, such as block parties, dances and
celebrations, and other positive ways to which the citizens of Carrboro can
celebrate their life and community together.
(7) Let citizens get to know each other better.
(8) Foster a web of personal acquaintances that transcend neighborhoods,
churches, non-profit organizations and other subgroups in the town.
(d) Membership. Each neighborhood shall be asked to send a representative and to have
an alternate to serve when the representative is unavailable. The geographical boundaries of each
"neighborhood" shall be determined by the Board of Aldermen. Generally, when a neighborhood or
homeowners' association exists, the neighborhood designated by the Board shall be co-extensive with
the membership in that association, and the representative from that neighborhood should be selected
by the association. If such an association does not exist, the Board of Aldermen shall solicit
nominations and select a representative and alternate.
(1) To the extent possible, neighborhoods may be grouped so as to provide equity in
representation.
(2) New neighborhoods will be assigned to an existing neighborhood until such
time as their size indicates a need for individual representation.
(3) Members will serve for one year with the right to be re-appointed for a second
term and the right to be re-appointed thereafter after an absence from the Forum for
a minimum of one year.
(e) Meeting Process; Principles. In general, meetings of the Neighborhood Forum will be
conducted in accordance with the following principles:
(1) Allowance will be made for ambivalence, for questions, for ideas to be tested, and
for connections to be made.
(2) Members are encouraged to draw on their own life experience and imagination
and to use their own sense of what seems right.
(3) Emotion is a vital part of public discussion.
(4) Every member plays a meaningful role.
(5) No neighborhood carries more weight than any other.
(6) A safe environment will be created for members to express beliefs, opinions and
feelings, to change their minds, and to share responsibilities and control.
(f) Meeting process; ground rules. A chairperson will direct the meetings and discussions.
The chairperson will receive meeting facilitation training in accordance with the following ground
rules:
(1) Test assumptions and inferences
(2) Share all relevant information
(3) Focus on interests not positions
(4) Be specific - give examples
(5) Agree on what important words mean
(6) Explain the reasons behind one's statements, questions and actions
(7) Disagree openly when in disagreement
(8) Make statements, then invite questions and comments
(9) Jointly design ways to test disagreements and solutions
(10) Avoid taking cheap shots or otherwise distracting the council members
(11) Make decisions by consensus where possible. With respect to deliberations
conducted under paragraphs 2 and 3 of the "Charge" as set forth above, the
principal objectives of such discussions are stated therein; therefore, where
consensus does not exist, it is not intended that the forum shall attempt to state a
"collective position" on such issues, by a majority vote or otherwise.
(g) Meeting Schedule. A chairperson and a vice-chairperson will be elected on an annual
basis for purposes of running the meetings. The Neighborhood Forum will meet quarterly or as
otherwise directed or needed.

Section 3-37 Dispute Mediation (Amend. 6/8/99)
(a) Findings. The Board finds that:
(1) When conflicts or disputes arise between individuals, or neighbors, or
groups, or between developers and neighbors, the Town of Carrboro and
its employees or elected officials are sometimes called upon to resolve
such conflicts through official action (e.g. the adoption, enforcement, or
amendment of an ordinance, or the issuance or denial of a land use
permit); and
(2) The interests of the parties to such conflicts or disputes may be more
satisfactorily addressed if such conflicts or disputes are resolved by the
parties themselves, with the assistance of a facilitator or mediator, rather
than by official action by the Town; and
(3) It is in the town’s interest to establish a policy for referring certain
disputes to the Dispute Settlement Center.
(b) Statement of Principles. The purpose and intent of the policy set forth herein is
captured in the following statement of principles:
(1) Mediation is a process of resolving disputes through collaboration with the
aid of a neutral third person called a mediator who helps to fashion
agreements between parties in dispute. Mediation and collaboration
problem solving emphasize the possibility and desirability of “win-win”
solutions.
(2) The Town of Carrboro believes that the process of mediation can be
effective in resolving disputes involving town government and in
nurturing and restoring community among its citizens. Promoting a
process for mediation and collaboration can diminish polarization and
engender a better knowledge and understanding between diverse
individuals or groups of individuals. It can also achieve a better
3-10
explanation, discovery and understanding of the needs and values of
differing points of view, as well as lead to the resolution of disputes and
conflicts. Finally, institutionalizing ways for dispute resolution can lead to
a climate of caring, trust and more teamwork among citizens and foster an
atmosphere of cooperation and connectedness that helps citizens deal with
each other humanely, with respect to differences, and not as opponents in
a contest.
(3) The Town’s support of a deliberative process of mediation does not mean
that people cannot or should not have differing opinions or beliefs. An
aspect of a process of mediation is creating a safe environment where
citizens can express their beliefs, opinions and feelings openly, and then
work to try to reconcile those beliefs, opinions and feelings with ones of
an opposite point of view. The purpose of such a process is not to abolish
conflict but to achieve constructive outcomes from conflict.
(c) Referral by Board. The Board may refer to the Dispute Settlement Center (DSC)
any conflict or dispute whenever it appears that the services of the DSC would be helpful in
either resolving the conflict or at least clarifying or narrowing the areas of controversy. When a
dispute arises in the context of an application for a land use permit or other action that the town
is required to take upon the request of an applicant, then such referral may only take place with
the consent of the applicant.
(d) Referral by Town Manager. The Town Manager is authorized to refer to the
DSC disputes or conflicts under the following circumstances:
(1) The dispute is between two individuals or a small and identifiable group of
individuals; and
(2) The manager concludes that official town action to resolve the conflict is
not warranted, either because (I) no ordinance covers the matter at issue
and the manager would not recommend adopting or amending an
ordinance to deal with the situation, or (ii) an ordinance covers the matter
but the manager does not believe that the town should use its resources to
enforce the ordinance under the circumstances presented; and
(3) The dispute is one for which DSC will provide mediation services without
charge to the parties or the town.
(e) Deferral of Action Pending Mediation. Once a referral is made under this
policy, then the town may defer taking any further action until the mediation or facilitation
process is concluded.
(f) The manager shall negotiate and return to the Board for its approval an
agreement with DSC covering its services under this policy. Among other matters, the
agreement shall cover:
(1) The establishment of a referral form that would notify DSC and the town
that a dispute has been referred to DSC.
3-11
(2) The costs of DSC’s services and a mechanism for assuring that such costs
do not exceed any appropriation made pursuant to this policy.

to appropriate disciplinary action, as well as prosecution under any civil or criminal laws which
have been violated. (Amend. 6/19/2007)
Section 4-7 Departmental Rules and Regulations
Because of the particular personnel and operational requirements of the various departments of
the Town, each department is authorized to establish supplemental written rules and regulations
applicable only to the personnel of that department. All such rules and regulations shall be

a. Type 1 Grievance: A grievance in which the claim or complaint involves a contention that
the aggrieved employee has been unfairly evaluated or treated by another employee or
agent of the Town. By way of illustration without limitation, a Type 1 grievance may
involve a claim that an employee has unfairly received a negative performance evaluation
or been denied a performance increase or has been the victim of unfair or discriminatory
supervisory practices or unjust treatment by fellow workers.
4-7
b. Type 2 Grievance: A grievance in which the claim or complaint involves a contention that
the employee is being or has been adversely affected by generally applicable policies or

POSITION CLASSIFICATION PLAN
Section 4-9 Purpose.
The position classification plan provides a complete inventory of all authorized and permanent
positions in the Town service, and an accurate description and specification for each class of
employment. The plan standardizes job titles, each of which is indicative of a definite range of
duties and responsibilities.
Section 4-10 Composition of the Position Classification Plan
The classification plan shall consist of:
a) a grouping of positions in classes which are approximately equal in difficulty and
responsibility which call for the same general qualifications, and which can be
equitably compensated within the same range of pay under similar working
conditions;
b) class titles descriptive of the work of the class;
c) written specifications for each class of positions; and
d) an allocation list showing the class title of each position in the classified service.
Section 4-11 Use of the Position Classification Plan
The classification plan is to be used:
a) as a guide in recruiting and examining applicants for employment;
b) in determining lines of promotion and in developing employee training programs;
c) in determining salary to be paid for various types of work;
d) in determining personnel service items in departmental budgets; and
e) in providing uniform job terminology.
Section 4-12 Administration of the Position Classification Plan
The Town Manager, assisted by the Human Resources Director shall allocate each position
covered by the classification plan to its appropriate class, and shall be responsible for the
administration of the position classification plan. The Town Manager shall periodically review
portions of the classification plan and make minor revisions to insure that classifications
accurately reflect current job duties and responsibilities. The Town Manager shall also
periodically review the entire classification plan and, when needed, recommend major changes to
the Board of Aldermen.
4-9
Section 4-13 Authorization of Positions and the Position Classification Plan
The Town Manager needs the flexibility to adjust the staffing and assignment of
personnel from time to time to ensure that priority services and programs approved by
the Board of Aldermen are being addressed efficiently. Given such, the Town Manager
shall establish, administer, and maintain a current plan of classification of all positions
and shall allocate and reallocate positions to classes on the basis of kind and level of
duties and responsibilities within the parameters of the adopted budget.
Section 4-14. Request for Reclassification
Each budget year, any employee who considers the position in which the employee is classified to
be improper shall submit a request in writing for reclassification to such employee's immediate
supervisor, who shall immediately transmit the request through the department head who will
review the request and determine if it should be forwarded to the Human Resources Director. The
position will be reviewed to determine the merits of the reclassification, and any recommendations
to revise the classification and pay plan will be made to the Town Manager.
4-10
ARTICLE III
THE PAY PLAN
Section 4-15 Definition
The pay plan, published as a separate document, includes the basic salary schedule and the "List of
Classes Arranged by Grades" adopted by the Board of Aldermen. The salary schedule consists of
minimum, midpoint, and maximum salary for all classes of positions.
Section 4-16 Payroll Deduction Authorization
Deductions shall be made from each employee's salary, as required by law. Additional deductions
may be made upon the request of the employee and based upon the capability of payroll equipment
and appropriateness of the deduction.
Section 4-17 Service Level Benefits (Amend. 12/2/08, 6/16/09)
Full-time employees of the Town may be compensated for years of service by payment of a
longevity supplement based on continuous years of service as of December 31st of each year if
funds are appropriated in the Annual Budget Ordinance. Payment of this benefit begins at five
years of creditable service and is paid in a lump sum benefit in December of each calendar year.
The amount of the benefit is the same for each employee who is in the same seniority group.
Differing amounts are provided according to the following schedule:
5 – 9 years
10 -14 years
15 – 19 years
20 or more years
Employees that separate Town employment and return within one year will be credited with
previous service for the purposes of the service level benefit.
The amount of the service level benefit is indexed each year to reflect the cost of living portion of
the pay for performance increase. Continuous service is defined as continuous employment
including any approved leave or involuntary reduction in force.
4-11
ARTICLE IV. RECRUITMENT AND EMPLOYMENT
Section 4-18 Equal Employment Opportunity Policy
It is the policy of the Town to foster, maintain and promote equal employment opportunity. The
Town shall select employees on the basis of the applicant's qualifications for the job and award
them, with respect to compensation and opportunity for training and advancement, including
upgrading and promotion, without regard to age, race, color, religion, sex, national origin, political
affiliation, non-disqualifying disability, sexual orientation, marital status, gender identity, or gender
expression.
Section 4-19 Implementation of Equal Employment Opportunity Policy
All personnel responsible for recruitment and employment will continue to review regularly the
implementation of this personnel policy and relevant practices to assure that equal employment
opportunity based on reasonable, job-related requirements is being actively observed to the end that
no employee or applicant for employment shall suffer discrimination because of age, race, color,
religion, sex, national origin, political affiliation, non-disqualifying disability, sexual orientation,
marital status, gender identity, or gender expression. Notices with regard to equal employment
matters shall be posted in conspicuous places on Town premises in places where notices are
customarily posted.
Section 4-20 Recruitment, Selection, and Appointment
Recruitment Sources. When position vacancies occur, the Human Resources Director shall
publicize these opportunities for employment, including applicable salary information and
employment qualifications. Information on job openings will be published in local and/or other
news media as necessary to inform the community and create a quality and diverse pool of
applicants. In addition, notice of vacancies shall be posted at designated conspicuous sites within
departments. Individuals shall be recruited from a geographic area as wide as necessary and for a
period of time sufficient to ensure that well-qualified applicants are obtained for Town service. The
North Carolina Employment Security Commission shall normally be used as a recruitment source.
In rare situations because of emergency conditions, high turnover, etc., the Town may hire or
promote without advertising jobs, upon approval of the Town Manager.
Job Advertisements. Employment advertisements shall contain assurances of equal employment
opportunity and shall comply with Federal and State statutes.
Application for Employment. All persons expressing interest in employment with the Town shall
be given the opportunity to file an application for employment for positions which are currently
being recruited.
Application Reserve File. Applications shall be kept in an inactive reserve file for a period of two
years, in accordance with Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines.
Selection. Department heads, with the assistance of the Human Resources Director, shall make
such investigations and conduct such examinations as necessary to assess accurately the knowledge,
skills, and experience qualifications required for the position. All selection devices administered by
the Town shall be valid measures of job performance.
4-12
Appointment. Before any commitment is made to an applicant either internal or external, the
Department Head shall make recommendations to the Human Resources Director including the
position to be filled, the salary to be paid, and the reasons for selecting the candidate over other
candidates.
Living Wage. Every permanent Town of Carrboro position, whether full-time or part-time, is paid
at least a living wage equivalent to the federal poverty level for a family of four adjusted for the
Raleigh-Durham area cost of living. (Amend. 12/2/08)
Section 4-21 Probationary Period
An employee appointed to a permanent position shall serve a probationary period. Employees shall
serve a six - month probationary period, except that part-time employees, sworn police officers and
fire personnel shall serve a twelve-month probationary period (six months for Police Chief and Fire
Chief). Employees hired as trainees shall remain on probation until the provisions of their
traineeship are satisfied; however not to exceed 18 months. During the probationary period,
supervisors shall monitor an employee's performance and communicate with the employee
concerning performance progress. Before the end of the probationary period, the supervisor and/or
department head shall conduct a performance evaluation conference with the employee and discuss
accomplishments, strengths, and needed improvements. A summary of this discussion shall be
documented in the employee's personnel file as an evaluation form. The supervisor shall
recommend in writing to the Manager, or his designee as to whether the probationary period should
has been successfully completed, should be extended, or the employee transferred, demoted, or
dismissed. Probationary periods may be extended up to fifty percent (50%) of the initial period.
Disciplinary action, including demotion and dismissal, may be taken at any time during the
probationary period of a new employee without following the steps outlined in this Policy for
disciplinary action. Given such, probationary employees serving an initial probationary period in a
position with the Town are not entitled to utilize the procedures for appeal of disciplinary action set
forth in Section 4-92. (Amend. 6/19/2007)
An employee who moves from one position to another (promotion, demotion, transfer) will serve a
new probationary period in the new position; however, the employee is entitled to use the
procedures for appeal of disciplinary action. (Amend. 6/19/2007)
Section 4-22 Promotion
Promotion is the movement of an employee from one position to a vacant position in a class
assigned to a higher salary range. It is the Town's policy to create career opportunities for its
employees whenever possible. Therefore, when a current employee applying for a vacant position
is best suited of all applicants, that applicant shall be appointed to that position. The Town will
balance three goals in the employment process: 1) the benefits to employees and the organization of
promotion from within; 2) providing equal employment opportunity and a diversified workforce to
the community; and 3) obtaining the best possible employee who will provide the most productivity
in that position. Therefore, except in rare situations where previous Town experience is essential
(such as promotions to Police Lieutenant or Fire Captain), or exceptional qualifications of an
internal candidate so indicate, the Town will consider external and internal candidates rather than
automatically promote from within. Candidates for promotion shall be chosen on the basis of their
qualifications and their work records. Internal candidates shall apply for promotions using the same
application process as external candidates.
4-13
Department heads are responsible for developing staff capacity to provide back-up for coworkers
and higher level positions; to prepare staff and the organization for smooth transitions; and to insure
capability to cover interim absences and vacancies.
Section 4-23 Demotion
Demotion is the movement of an employee from one position to a position in a class assigned to a
lower salary range. Demotion may be voluntary or involuntary. An employee whose work or
conduct in the current position is unsatisfactory may be demoted provided that the employee shows
promise of becoming a satisfactory employee in the lower position. Such disciplinary demotion
shall follow the disciplinary procedures outlined in this chapter.
An employee who wishes to accept a position with less complex duties and reduced responsibilities
may request a voluntary demotion. A voluntary demotion is not a disciplinary action and is made
without using the above-referenced disciplinary procedures; however, this does not preclude a
reduction in salary.
Section 4-24 Transfer
Transfer is the movement of an employee from one position to a position in a class in the same
salary range. If a vacancy occurs and an employee in another department is eligible for a transfer,
the employee shall apply for the transfer using the usual application process. The Department Head
wishing to transfer an employee to a different department or classification shall make a
recommendation to the Town Manager or his designee with the consent of the receiving department
head. Any employee transferred without requesting the action may appeal the action in accordance
with the grievance procedure outlined in this policy. An employee who has successfully completed
a probationary period may be transferred into the same classification without serving another
probationary period.
4-14
ARTICLE V. CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT
Section 4-25 Work Schedule
Department heads shall establish work schedules, with the approval of the Town Manager, which
meet the operational needs of the department in the most cost effective manner possible.
Section 4-26 Political Activity
Each employee has a civic responsibility to support good government by every available means and
in every appropriate manner. Each employee may join or affiliate with civic organizations of a
partisan or political nature, may attend political meetings, may advocate and support the principles
or policies of civic or political organizations in accordance with the Constitution and laws of the
State of North Carolina and in accordance with the Constitution and laws of the United States.
However, no employee shall:
a) Engage in any political or partisan activity while on duty;
b) Use official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the
result of a nomination or an election for office;
c) Be required as a duty of employment or as condition for employment, promotion or
tenure of office to contribute funds for political or partisan purposes;
d) Coerce or compel contributions from another employee of the Town for political or
partisan purposes;
e) Use any supplies or equipment of the Town for political or partisan purposes; or
f) No official may be employed by the Town in any capacity. If an employee is elected
or selected to an official position, then he or she forfeits his or her employment with
the Town upon assuming that office.
Any violation of this section shall subject the employee to disciplinary action including dismissal.
Section 4-27 Outside Employment
The work of the Town shall have precedence over other occupational interests of employees. All
outside employment for salaries, wages, or commission and all self-employment must be reported in
advance to the employee's supervisor, who in turn will report it to the Department Head. The
Department Head will review such employment for possible conflict of interest and decide whether
to approve the work. Conflicting or unreported outside employment are grounds for disciplinary
action up to and including dismissal. Documentation of the approval of outside employment will be
placed in the employee’s personnel file.
Examples of conflicts of interest in outside employment include but are not limited to:
a) employment with organizations or in capacities that are regulated by the employee or
employee’s department; or
4-15
b) employment with organizations or in capacities that negatively impact the employee’s
perceived integrity, neutrality, or reputation related to performance of the employee’s
Town duties.
Outside employment as it relates to law enforcement contains more specific criteria that should be
included in the Police Department’s Administrative manual.
Section 4-28 Dual Employment
If the Town of Carrboro elects to approve such, a full or part-time employee of the Town may
simultaneously hold another position with the Town if the temporary position is in a different
department and clearly a different program area from that of the full or part-time position and the
employment in the temporary position is performed on an occasional or sporadic basis. However,
the work of the full or part-time position shall take precedence over the temporary position, and
such work will not count toward the calculation of overtime for pay or time off.
Section 4-29 Employment of Relatives
The Town prohibits the hiring and employment of immediate family in permanent or temporary
positions within the same department. "Immediate Family" is defined in Article I, Section 4-8. The
Town also prohibits the employment of any person into a permanent position who is an immediate
family member of individuals holding the following positions: Mayor, Mayor Pro Tem, Board of
Aldermen Member, Town Manager, Town Clerk, Town Attorney, or any Town department head.
Otherwise, the Town will consider employing family members or related persons in the service of
the Town, provided that such employment does not:
1) result in a relative supervising relatives;
2) result in a relative auditing the work of a relative;
3) create a conflict of interest with either relative and the Town; or
4) create the potential or perception of favoritism.
This clause shall not be retroactive concerning any relative currently working for the Town at the
time of adoption of this policy.
Section 4-30 Harassment
Harassment on the basis of age, race, color, religion, sex, national origin, political affiliation, nondisqualifying
disability, sexual orientation, marital status, gender identity, or gender expression is
discrimination. The Town opposes harassment by supervisors and co-workers in any form.
Harassment is verbal or physical conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an
individual because of his or her age, race, color, religion, sex, national origin, political affiliation,
non-disqualifying disability, sexual orientation, marital status, gender identity, or gender expression,
or that of his or her relatives, friends, or associates.
Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other
verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when 1) submission to such conduct is made either
explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment; 2) submission to or
4-16
rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting
such individual; or 3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an
individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working
environment.
Any employee who believes that he or she may have a complaint of harassment may follow the
Grievance Procedure described in this Policy or may file the complaint directly with the Town
Manager, Human Resources Director, or any department head who will advise the Human
Resources Director of the complaint. The Human Resources Director will insure that an
investigation is conducted into any allegation of harassment and advise the employee and
appropriate management officials of the outcome of the investigation. Employees witnessing
harassment shall also report such conduct to an appropriate Town official.
Section 4-31 Acceptance of Gifts and Favors

from any person who to the knowledge of the official or employee is interested directly or indirectly in

Section 4-33 Safety
Safety is the responsibility of both the Town and employees. It is the policy of the Town to establish
a safe work environment for employees. The Town shall establish a safety program including
policies and procedures regarding safety practices and precautions and training in safety methods.
Department Heads and supervisors are responsible for insuring the safe work procedures of all
employees and providing necessary safety training programs. Employees shall follow the safety
policies and procedures and attend safety training programs as a condition of employment.
Employees who violate such policies and procedures shall be subject to disciplinary action up to
and including dismissal.
Section 4-34 Substance Abuse Policy
The Town has established policies and procedures related to employee substance abuse in order to
insure the safety and well-being of citizens and employees, and to comply with any state, federal, or

Section 4-36 Adverse Weather/Hazardous Conditions (Amend 11-17-15)
(a) The Town has responsibility for emergency services including law enforcement. Adequate
staff are required to operate critical Town Services seven days per week, twenty four hours
per day in all weather. Department heads should designate which staff positions and
personnel are critical and, therefore, required to report to work regardless of weather or
other hazardous conditions.
(b) All Town departments are affected by extreme weather conditions. The Town Manager
will make decisions related to the delayed opening, early closing, or full-day closure of
Town Hall and administrative offices. When these circumstances occur, employee work
attendance and compensation will be handled as described:
(1) Non-emergency, non-exempt employees: If Town offices are closed due to extreme
weather conditions, non-emergency, non-exempt employees will be paid their regular hourly rate
for work hours missed due to the closing, up to a maximum of twenty-four (24) hours per fiscal
year. If Town offices are open during extreme weather, non-emergency, non-exempt employees
with supervisor approval may use accrued time, or leave without pay, if they are absent from work
due to local extreme weather conditions. (for example, roads near an employee’s home are not clear
but roads in Carrboro are safe.)
(2) Non- emergency, exempt employees: If Town offices are closed due to extreme
weather conditions, non-emergency, exempt employees will be paid their regular salary for work
hours missed due to a full day closing, for a maximum of three (3) full-day closures per fiscal year.
If Town offices are open during extreme weather, non-emergency, exempt employees with Town
Manger approval may use accrued time, or leave without pay, if they are absent for a full day from
work due to extreme weather conditions. (for example, roads near an employee’s home are not clear
but roads in Carrboro are safe.)
(3) Emergency and weather - essential employees: Many of the Town’s employees must
function at all times regardless of weather conditions. Emergency and weather-essential employees
are required to report to work. The Town Manager will exercise his/her best judgement for each
weather situation as to which employees are considered essential. If Town offices delay opening,
close early, or are closed for a full day, emergency and weather essential staff who work during this
time will receive compensatory time up to but not exceeding twenty-four (24) hours per year due to
extreme weather conditions, in the equivalent amount as non-emergency employees.
(4) There will be no accrual, no pay-out, and no carry-over of these days from one fiscal
year to another.
(5) Previously scheduled sick and/or vacation leave during extreme weather conditions
will be deducted as originally scheduled and approved and will not be eligible for compensatory
time.
4-18
Section 4-37 Residency (Amend. 6/20/2006)
Within six months after his or her appointment the Town Manager shall become a resident of the
Town and shall remain a resident of the town during his or her tenure as Manager.
The Board of Aldermen also deems it important to the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of
the Town of Carrboro that the administrative heads of the police department and fire department
reside within close proximity to the town so that they can generally be available to respond rapidly
to the town’s needs at all times. Therefore, within six months of their appointment, the police chief
and fire chief, respectively, shall establish residency that is no more than fifteen miles (measured on
a straight line basis) from the town limits. They shall continue to adhere to this requirement while
employed by the town.
All department heads are encouraged but shall not be required to reside within the Town. A person
becomes a resident of or establishes residency within the prescribed area when the person:
a) has left his or her prior home with no intent to return to the prior home as a place of regular
habitation; and b) has rented, leased, or purchased a dwelling unit (as defined in the Carrboro Land
Use Ordinance) within the prescribed area; and c) has established such dwelling unit as his or her
regular place of habitation and the place to which, whenever he or she is absent, he or she has the
intention of returning; and d) actually resides within the dwelling unit on a regular basis at least
five evenings during normal weeks.

premium for a retiree’s dependents.
The percentage of the insurance premium for the group health plan, the group Medicare Supplement
Plan, or the percentage of the stipend paid for by the Town for retirees is based upon years of
service according to the schedule listed below.
Continuous years of Service Percentage of Insurance Premium to be Paid by Town
10 - 14 years 50%
15 - 19 years 75%
20 years and up 100%

the insurance provider for the retiree coverage under the group health plan or the group Medicare
supplement plan.

reduced or withdrawn at any time in the unilateral discretion of the Board of Aldermen for financial
reasons or any other reason deemed sufficient by the Board of Aldermen.
Information concerning cost and benefits shall be available to all employees from the Human
Resources Department.

Workers' Compensation Act and are required to report all injuries arising out of and in the course of
employment to their immediate supervisors at the time of the injury in order that appropriate action
may be taken at once.
Responsibility for claiming compensation under the Workers’ Compensation Act is on the injured
employee, and such claims should be filed with the North Carolina Industrial Commission within
five days of the date of injury. The Human Resources Director will assist the employee in filing the
claim if necessary.
Section 4-46 Unemployment Compensation

reimbursement for courses taken on their own time, which will improve their skills for their current
job or prepare them for promotional opportunities with the Town. Tuition, registration fees,

Resources Department prior to course registration and are subject to the review and approval of
Department Head and Town Manager. Tuition assistance funds are available only as budgeted
annually.
Section 4-48 Legal Defense of Employees
The policy of the Town is to provide for the defense of all employees for acts or omissions
allegedly committed while in the course and scope of their employment or duty as an employee of
the Town. Upon request made by or on behalf of any employee or former employee, the Town
shall provide for the defense of any civil or criminal action or proceeding brought against them
either in their official capacity or individual capacity, or both, on account of any act done or
omission made, or any act allegedly done or omission allegedly made in the scope of their
employment or duty as an employee of the Town. The defense may be provided by the Town by its
own counsel, or by employing other counsel, or by purchasing insurance that requires that the
insured provide the counsel. Limits on the amount of defense expenditures may be set by the Town
Manager, in relation to prevailing local rates in consideration of available budget funding.
4-22
In addition, the Board of Aldermen may appropriate funds for the purpose of paying all or part of a
claim made or a civil judgment entered against any employee or former employee of the Town
when such claim is made or such judgment is rendered regarding any act done or omission made, or
any act allegedly done or omission allegedly made, in the scope and course of such employee’s
employment with the Town, subject to the following:
1) No such payment shall be made if the Board finds that the employee acted or
failed to act because of actual fraud, corruption or actual malice.
2) No such payment shall be made unless notice of the claim or litigation is given to
the Board prior to the time that the claim is settled or civil judgment is entered.
3) Funds may be appropriated under this section only if and to the extent that a
determination has been made that no insurance is available to the employee
(whether provided by the Town or by the employee) to cover the payment of
such claim or judgment.
4) In determining whether to appropriate funds for the payment of a claim or
judgment under this section, the Board shall consider (i) the amount of the claim
or judgment and whether the payment would have a significantly adverse impact
on the Town’s ability to fulfill its other budgetary priorities; (ii) the nature and
extent of the injury that gives rise to the claim; (iii) the impact of the Board’s
decision on the employee; (iv) the extent to which the employee was culpable in
causing the injury that gives rise to the claim or judgment; and (v) any other
factor bearing upon the question of whether payment of the claim or judgment
would be fair and appropriate and in the best interest of the residents and
taxpayers of the Town of Carrboro.”

ARTICLE VII. HOLIDAYS AND LEAVES OF ABSENCE
Section 4-49 Policy
The policy of the Town is to provide annual leave, sick leave, and holiday leave to all permanent
full-time and part-time employees. Leave is provided in pro-rated amounts to employees working
less than the standard thirty-seven and one-half (37 ½) hours per week. Leave balances should be
printed on direct deposit stubs and provided to employees with each pay stub.
Section 4-50 Holidays
The following days, and other such days as the Board of Aldermen may designate, are holidays with
full pay for permanent employees.
New Year’s Day Independence Day
Martin Luther King Jr.’s Birthday Labor Day
Easter Friday Thanksgiving Thursday & Friday
Memorial Day Christmas Day (3 working days)
When any recognized holiday other than Christmas Day falls on a Saturday or a Sunday, Monday
shall be observed in recognition of the holiday.
When Christmas Day falls on: The Town observes:
Sunday Thursday, Friday and Monday
Monday Friday, Monday and Tuesday
Tuesday Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
Wednesday Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday
Thursday Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
Friday Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
Saturday Thursday, Friday and Monday
In order to receive pay for a holiday, an employee must be on paid status before and after the
holiday.
Section 4-51 Holidays: Effect on Other Types of Leave
Regular holidays which occur during annual leave, sick leave, or other leave period of any
employee shall not be considered as annual leave, sick leave, or other leave.
Section 4-52 Holidays: Compensation for Public Safety Shift Personnel (Amend. 6/3/08,
6/4/19)
Sworn shift police and fire personnel, whether on duty or not, shall receive pay for all eleven
Town holidays as the holidays occur. Sworn shift police officers shall receive pay at straight time for
the number of hours equivalent to a regularly scheduled shift, i.e. 8.4 hours or 12 hours. Shift fire
personnel shall receive pay for the holidays at 11 hours of straight time per holiday.
Compensatory time shall not be awarded or accrued for holiday compensation when shift
personnel are required to work on a holiday. No holiday compensation for hours worked shall be
4-24
accrued by an employee.
Because the Town continues to operate emergency services seven days a week, twenty- four
hours per day, public safety personnel working a shift may be required to work on scheduled
holidays. When shift public safety personnel are required to work on a scheduled holiday, the
employee shall receive regular pay for all hours actually worked. Holiday pay shall not be factored
into overtime pay; however, in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), all hours
actually worked shall be factored into overtime calculations, including those hours worked on
scheduled holidays.
Section 4-53 Annual Leave
Annual leave may be used for rest and relaxation, absences due to adverse weather conditions, and
other reasons as the employee may deem necessary.
Section 4-54 Annual Leave: Use by Probationary Employees
Employees serving a probationary period following initial employment may accumulate annual
leave but shall not be permitted to use such leave during the probationary period. Employees who
need to take time off may do so upon the approval of the department head; however, any time off
will be without pay. Employees shall be allowed to take accumulated annual leave after successful
completion of probation.
Section 4-55 Annual Leave: Accrual Rate
Annual leave shall be earned by persons employed permanent full-time in accordance with the
following table. Persons employed permanent part-time shall earn annual leave in a prorated
amount based upon this table:
Years of Service Days Accrued Per Year *Duty Days Per Year
Less than 2 years 12 6
2 but less than 5 years 14 7
5 but less than 10 years 17 8
10 but less than 15 years 20 9
15 but less than 20 years 23 11
20 years or more 26 12
*For shift employees of the Fire Department.
Section 4-56 Annual Leave Pro-rated
Annual leave earned by permanent full-time and part-time employees with fewer or more hours
than the basic work week shall be determined by the following formula:
1) The number of hours worked by such employees shall be divided by the number of
hours in the basic workweek (37.5 for the standard Town department).
2) The proportion obtained in step 1 shall be multiplied by the number of hours of leave
4-25
earned annually by employees working the basic workweek.
3) The number of hours in step 2 divided by 12 shall be the number of hours of leave
earned monthly by the employees concerned, divided by 26 shall be the number of
hours of leave earned per bi-weekly payroll period.
Section 4-57 Annual Leave: Maximum Accumulation
Annual leave may be accumulated without any applicable maximum until December 31 of each
year. However, if the employee departs from service, payment for accumulated annual leave shall
not exceed 240 hours (14 duty days for shift fire personnel). Effective the last payroll in the
calendar year, any employee with more than this maximum amount of accumulated leave shall have
the excess accumulation transferred to their sick leave balance so that only 240 hours (14 duty days
for fire personnel) are carried forward to January 1st of the next calendar year. Annual leave is
accumulated while the employee is in continuous service and in pay status, or while on workers’
compensation leave.
Employees are cautioned not to retain excess accumulated annual leave until late in the year.
Because of the necessity to keep all functions in operation, large numbers of employees cannot be
granted annual leave at any one time. If an employee has excess leave accumulation during the
latter part of the year and is unable to take such leave because of staffing demands, the employee
shall receive no special consideration either in having annual leave scheduled or in receiving any
exception to the maximum accumulation.
Section 4-58 Annual Leave: Manner of Taking
Employees should request annual leave in advance of the requested leave time. Employees shall be
granted the use of earned annual leave at those times designated by the Department Head which will
least obstruct normal operations of the Town. Department heads are responsible for insuring that
approved annual leave does not hinder the effectiveness of service delivery. All eligible department
heads (those having completed probation) shall be required to take annual leave equivalent to five
(5) consecutive working days per year. An exemption to this section may be granted by the Town
Manager.
Section 4-59 Annual Leave: Payment upon Separation or Retirement
An employee who has successfully completed six months of the probationary period will normally
be paid for accumulated annual leave upon separation, subject to a 240 hour maximum (14 duty
days for shift fire personnel), provided written notice is given to the supervisor at least two weeks in
advance of the effective date of resignation (minimum of 30 days notice for department heads).
Any employee failing to give the written notice required by this section shall forfeit payment for
accumulated leave. The notice requirement may be waived by the Town Manager when deemed to
be in the best interest of the Town.
An employee retiring under the provisions of the North Carolina Local Government Retirement
System may have any excess annual leave (above 240 hours or 14 duty days for shift fire personnel)
converted to sick leave and used for retirement service credit.
4-26
Section 4-60 Annual Leave: Payment upon Death
The estate of an employee who dies while employed by the Town shall be entitled to payment of all
the accumulated annual leave credited to the employee's account.
Section 4-61 Sick Leave
Sick leave may be granted to an employee absent from work for any of the following reasons:
sickness, bodily injury, temporary disabilities, required physical or dental examinations or
treatment, or exposure to a contagious disease, when continuing work might jeopardize the health of
others.
Sick leave may be used when an employee must care for a member of his or her immediate family
who is ill or needs medical care; however, any sick leave that the employee receives under the
shared leave program may be used only for the employee’s personal illness or medical care.
Sick leave may also be used to supplement Workers' Compensation Disability Leave both during
the waiting period before Workers' compensation benefits begin, and afterward to supplement the
remaining one third of salary, except that employee may not exceed the regular gross salary amount
using this provision.
With the permission of the department head, sick leave may be used for death in the employee’s
immediate family after bereavement leave has been exhausted (one day sick leave per occurrence
for shift employees of the Fire Department and three days sick leave per occurrence for other
permanent employees).
"Immediate family" shall be defined as father, mother, wife, husband, son, daughter, brother, sister,
grandmother, grandfather, mother-in-law, father-in-law, daughter-in-law, son-in-law, half-sister,
half-brother, stepmother, stepfather, stepson, stepdaughter, stepsister, stepbrother, or any other
relative who is a guardian of the employee or a domestic partner.
Section 4-62 Sick Leave: Accrual Rate, Accumulation, and Manner of Taking
Sick leave shall accrue at a rate of one day per month of service or twelve days per year. Sick leave
for permanent part-time employees shall be pro-rated as described in this Article. Shift employees
of the Fire Department shall earn sick leave at the rate of four, twenty-four hour tour-of-duty days
for each completed year of service.
Notification of the desire to take sick leave shall be submitted to the employee’s supervisor prior to
the leave or not later than two hours after the beginning of a scheduled workday. Failure to so
notify the appropriate supervisor may result in disciplinary action.
The minimum amount of sick leave that may be taken is one hour, and leave must be taken in
increments of one hour.
Sick leave will be cumulative for an indefinite period of time and may be converted upon retirement
for service credit consistent with the provisions of the North Carolina Local Government
Employees' Retirement System.
4-27
All sick leave accumulated by an employee shall end and terminate without compensation when the
employee resigns or is separated from the Town.
Section 4-63 Transfer of Sick Leave from Previous Employer
The Town may accept the transfer of sick leave for employees from other employers who are
participants of the North Carolina Local Government or State Employees Retirement System. The
sick leave will be treated as though it were earned with the Town of Carrboro. The sick leave
amount must be certified by the previous employer. This sick leave may be taken after the
employee successfully completes the initial hire probationary period.
Section 4-64 Sick Leave: Medical Certification
The employee's supervisor or Department Head may require a physician's certificate stating the
nature of the employee's or employee’s family members’ illness and the employee's capacity to
resume duties, for each occasion on which an employee uses sick leave or whenever the supervisor
observes a "pattern of absenteeism." The employee may be required to submit to such medical
examination or inquiry as the Department Head deems desirable. The Department Head shall be
responsible for the application of this provision to the end that:
1) Employees shall not be on duty when they might endanger their health or the health
of other employees; and
2) There will be no abuse of leave privileges.
Claiming sick leave under false pretense to obtain a day off with pay shall subject the employee to
disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.
Section 4-65. Family and Medical Leave (Amend. 6/28/11)
The Town will grant up to 12 weeks of family and medical leave per twelve (12) months to eligible
employees in accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA). The leave may
be paid (coordinated with the Town 's Annual Leave and Sick Leave policies), unpaid, or a
combination of paid and unpaid. Unpaid leave will be granted only when the employee has
exhausted all appropriate types of paid leave. Additional time away from the job beyond the 12
week period may be granted with the approval of the Town Manager.
To qualify for FMLA coverage, the employee must have worked for the employer 12 months or 52
weeks; these do not have to be consecutive. However, the employee must have worked 1,250 hours
during the twelve month period immediately before the date when the FMLA time begins.
Family and medical leave can be used for the following reasons:
1. the birth of a child and in order to care for that child;
2. the placement of a child for adoption or foster care;
3. to care for a spouse, domestic partner, child (or child of the domestic partner), or
parent with a serious health condition;
4-28
4. the serious health condition of the employee; or
5. any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the spouse, or domestic partner,
child (or child of the domestic partner), or parent of the employee is on active duty,
or has been notified of an impending call to active duty status, in support of a
contingency operation.
A serious health condition is defined as a condition which requires inpatient care at a hospital,
hospice, or residential medical care facility, or a condition which requires continuing care by a
licensed health care provider. This policy covers illness of a serious and long-term nature resulting
in recurring or lengthy absences. Generally, a chronic or long term health condition which results
in a period of incapacity or more than three days would be considered a serious health condition.
If a husband and wife both work for the Town and each wishes to take leave for the birth of a child,
adoption or placement of a child in foster care, or to care for a parent (not parent in-law) with a
serious health condition, the husband and wife together may only take a total of 12 weeks leave
under FMLA.
An employee taking leave for the birth of a child may use paid sick leave for the period of actual
disability, based on medical certification; afterward, the employee must use other types of leave for
the remainder of the 12-week period.
An employee who takes leave under this policy will return to the same job or a job with equivalent
status, pay, benefits, and other employment terms. The position will be the same or one that entails
substantially equivalent skill, effort, responsibility, and authority.
Any employee requesting the use of leave must complete the appropriate FMLA form, submit it to
the department head for approval by the department head and the Town Manager, or his designee.
Section 4-66 Family and Medical Leave Certification
In order to qualify for leave under this law, the Town requires medical certification. This statement
from the employee's or the family member's physician should include the date when the condition
began, its expected duration, diagnosis, and brief statement of treatment. For the employee's own
health condition, it should state that the employee is unable to perform the essential functions of
his/her position. For a seriously ill family member, the certification must include a statement that
the patient requires assistance and the employee's presence would be beneficial or desirable.
This certification should be furnished at least 30 days prior to the needed leave unless the
employee's or family member's condition is a sudden one. The certification should be furnished as
soon as possible (no longer than 15 days from the date of the employee's request). The certification
and request must be made to the department head and filed with the Human Resources Director.
The employee is expected to return to work at the end of the time frame stated in the medical
certification, unless he/she has requested additional time in writing under the Town 's Leave
Without Pay policy.
4-29
Section 4-67 Leave Without Pay
A permanent full-time or part-time employee may be granted a leave of absence without pay for a
period of up to twelve months by the Town Manager. The Manager will (as information) report any
such leave granted an employee to the Board of Aldermen at the Board's next meeting after such
leave has been granted. The leave shall be used for reasons of personal disability after both sick
leave and annual leave have been exhausted, sickness or disability of immediate family members,
continuation of education, special work that will permit the Town to benefit by the experience
gained or the work performed, or for other reasons deemed justified by the Town Manager.
The employee shall apply in writing to the supervisor for leave. The employee is obligated to return
to duty within or at the end of the time determined appropriate by the Town Manager. Upon
returning to duty after being on leave without pay, the employee shall be entitled to return to the
same position held at the time leave was granted or to one of like classification, seniority, and pay.
If the employee decides not to return to work, the supervisor shall be notified immediately. Failure
to report at the expiration of a leave of absence, unless an extension has been requested, shall be
considered a resignation.
An employee who is in a leave without pay status will not accrue retirement service credits.
Section 4-68 Family Medical Leave and Leave Without Pay: Retention and Continuation of
Benefits
When an employee is on leave under FMLA (maximum of 12 weeks in a year), the Town will
continue the employee's health benefits during the leave period at the same level and under the same
conditions as if the employee had continued to work. If an employee chooses not to return to work
for reasons other than a continued serious health condition, the Town will require the
reimbursement of the amount paid for the employee's health insurance premium as well as that of
any dependents during the FMLA leave period.
Other insurance and payroll deductions are the responsibility of the employee and the employee
must make those payments for continued coverage of that benefit.
Any employee, upon the exhaustion of all leave benefits, may be placed on Leave Without Pay in
accordance with Section 4-67. An employee ceases to earn leave credits on the date leave without
pay begins. The employee may continue to be eligible for benefits under the Town 's group
insurance plans at his or her own expense, subject to any regulation adopted by the Board of
Aldermen and the regulations of the insurance carrier.
Section 4-69 Workers' Compensation Leave
An employee absent from duty because of sickness or disability covered by the North Carolina
Workers' Compensation Act may elect to use accrued sick leave, annual leave, or compensatory
time during initial waiting period for benefits. The employee may also elect to supplement workers'
compensation payments after they begin with sick leave, annual leave, or compensatory time,
provided that the combination of leave supplement and workers' compensation payments does not
exceed normal compensation. An employee on workers' compensation leave may be permitted to
continue to be eligible for benefits under the Town's group insurance plans. When workers'
compensation leave extends long enough for the waiting period to be reimbursed, the employee
shall return the reimbursement check to the Town and have leave hours re-instated for all time
4-30
covered by paid leave. In such cases, the Town will pay the employee for any unpaid time that is
owed the employee.
(a) All injuries arising out of, and during, the course of employment should be reported
by the injured employee to the immediate supervisor as soon as possible. The
supervisor or department head shall file an injury report to the Human Resources
Director or her designee within twenty-four (24) hours of the time of the accident.
The employee must use sick leave or annual leave for the first seven (7) days of
disability. These days will be reimbursed only if the disability continues for more
than twenty-one (21) days.
(b) Before returning to work, a statement from the attending physician should be
submitted to the Human Resources Director giving permission for the employee to
resume regular duties.
(c) Upon return to work, the employee's salary will be computed on the basis of the last
salary plus any merit increment or other salary increase to which the employee
would have been entitled during the disability covered by Workers' Compensation.
While receiving workers' compensation benefits, an employee continues to earn
annual leave sick leave, and petty leave; however, petty leave not used by the end of
the calendar year will be lost. Retirement service credit is not earned during a
workers’ compensation period.
This provision also applies to reactions to small pox vaccinations administered to County
employees under Section 304 of the Homeland Security Act. Such reactions shall be treated the
same as any other workers’ compensation claim as regards leave and salary continuation.
The Town reserves the right to consider a separation of employment for any employee who is out
on workers’ compensation for any reason for more than 12 (twelve) months.
Section 4-70 Military Leave
Regular employees who are members of an Armed Forces Reserve organization or National Guard
shall be granted two calendar weeks per year for military leave with pay. On rare occasions due to
annual training being scheduled on a federal fiscal year basis, an employee may be required to
attend two periods of training in one calendar year. For this purpose only, an employee shall be
granted an additional ten days of military leave during the same calendar year. If the compensation
received while on military leave is less than the salary that would have been earned during this same
period as a Town employee, the employee shall receive partial compensation equal to the
difference. The effect will be to maintain the employee's salary at the normal level during this
period. If such duty is required beyond these ten workdays, the employee shall be eligible to take
accumulated annual leave or be placed in a leave without pay status, and the provisions of that leave
shall apply. While taking military leave, the employee's leave credits and other benefits shall
continue to accrue as if the employee physically remained with the Town during this period.
Employees who are eligible for military leave have all job rights specified by the Vietnam Veterans
Readjustment Act.
If the compensation received while on military leave is less than the salary that would have been
earned during this same period as a town employee, the employee shall, for a maximum period of
three months, receive partial compensation equal to the difference in base salary earned as a
4-31
reservist or guardsman and the salary that would have been earned during this same period as a
town employee. The effect will be to maintain the employee's salary at the normal level during this
period.
Section 4-71 Reinstatement Following Military Service
An employee called to extended active duty with the United States military forces, who does not
volunteer for service beyond the period for which called, shall be reinstated with full benefits
provided the employee:
1) Applies for reinstatement within ninety days after the release from military service;
and
2) Is able to perform the duties of the former position or similar position; or
3) Is unable to perform the duties of the former position or a similar position due to
disability sustained as a result of the military service, but is able to perform the duties of
another position in the service of the Town . In this case the employee shall be employed in
such other position as will provide the nearest approximation of the seniority, status, and pay
which the employee otherwise would have been provided, if available.
Section 4-72 Civil Leave
A Town employee called for jury duty or as a court witness for the federal or state governments, or
a subdivision thereof, shall receive leave with pay for such duty during the required absence without
charge to accumulated leave. The employee may keep fees and travel allowances received for jury
or witness duty in addition to regular compensation; except, that employees must turn over to the
Town any witness fees or travel allowance awarded by that court for court appearances in
connection with official duties. While on civil leave, benefits and leave shall accrue as though on
regular duty.
Section 4-73 Personal Time Off (Amend. 6/4/19)
Effective July 1, 2019, permanent employees shall be granted eighteen (18) hours per year of
personal time off over and above sick leave and annual leave with pay. Personal time off under
Section 4-73 is separate from Town closures due to adverse weather. (See Section 4-36 Adverse
Weather, Rev. 11/15.)
Personal time off must be requested through supervisors and may be taken in the same manner
as sick and annual leave. Personal time off shall accrue biweekly at a rate of .6923 hours per pay
period beginning on January 1st of each calendar year. Employees may not carry over unused
personal time off from year to year. Any unused personal time off not taken by December 31st
shall be lost.
Section 4-74 Compensatory Time (Amend. 6/4/19)
As necessitated to ensure Town operations, non-exempt employees may, at times, be
required to work more than their regularly scheduled hours. According to the Fair Labor Standards
Act, local governments may elect to award compensatory time in lieu of overtime pay. 29
U.S.C.A.§ 207(o)(1).
4-32
Effective July 1, 2019, non-exempt, non-public safety employees may accrue up to a
maximum of forty (40) hours of compensatory time per calendar year. Non-exempt, public safety
employees may accrue up to a maximum of one hundred (100) hours of compensatory time per
calendar year. Exempt employees are not eligible for overtime pay and may not earn compensatory
time.
All non-exempt employees must use any earned compensatory time before taking any other
earned leave, including annual leave (vacation), personal time off, and/or sick leave.
Compensatory time in excess of the allowed maximum shall not be accumulative beyond the end
of each calendar year. Any unused compensatory time in excess of the allowed maximum as of
December 31st may be paid out in a lump sum by January 31st following the end of the
calendar year.
The Town Manager may grant a one-time exception to the maximum compensatory time
accrual for an employee or class of employees if so doing would be in the best interest of the Town.
In order to reduce instances of overtime work and compensatory time earnings, all Department
Heads and supervisors are expected to adjust employee work schedules during periods of heavy
workloads.
Section 4-75 Bereavement Leave
Full or part-time permanent employees are eligible for Bereavement Leave which may be used for
death in the employee's immediate family as defined in Section 4-8 of this article. The employee
may be granted up to five working days per calendar year (two working days for shift employees of
the Fire Department, and twenty hours for permanent part-time employees) with pay due to death of
immediate family. Additional leave time required for such occurrence may be charged to sick leave
or other approved leave, such as compensatory time when approved by the department head and/or
Town Manager. Bereavement Leave for those not covered by the immediate family definition may
be also charged to sick leave or compensatory time with the permission of the department head or
Town Manager. (Amend. 6/19/2007)
Section 4-76 Educational Leave
An employee that has completed one (1) year of employment with the Town may request
educational leave at full or partial pay for a period not to exceed nine (9) months. The Town
Manager may permit an employee to take courses of study that will better enable the employee to
perform their duties. Educational leave that exceeds fifteen (15) consecutive working days shall be
approved by the Board of Aldermen.
An employee granted extended leave with pay shall agree in writing to return to the service of the
Town upon completion of training and remain in the employment of the Town for a period equal to
twice the educational leave received; otherwise, the employee shall reimburse the Town for all
compensation received while on educational leave.
Section 4-77 Shared Leave
An employee my donate accumulated hours of their own annual leave or sick leave to another
employee who meets the criteria so that employee may be provided sick leave for his or her own
personal illness under the Town’s Shared Leave Program.
4-33
The recipient must meet the following requirements:
? has successfully completed the probationary period;
? has a personal medical condition that requires absence from work for more than three
consecutive work days as certified by a physician;
? has exhausted all sick leave, annual leave, and compensatory leave time;
? requests, in writing, leave under the Shared Leave Program and receives approval to request
shared leave through his or her department head;
? cannot receive more leave than needed for the medical condition as stated in writing by the
employee’s physician; and
? has not received shared leave within the past twelve months.
The donor must meet the following requirements:
? has successfully completed the probationary period;
? retains, after the donation, a combined annual leave and sick leave balance of no less than
240
hours;
? has not donated more than 100 hours of leave within the past 12 (twelve) months;
? agrees to donate a minimum of four (4) hours; and
? understands that the leave is irrevocable.
Employees out on workers’ compensation leave or employees receiving disability insurance
benefits are not eligible for shared leave. Leave is available for use on a current basis and is not
retroactive beyond the current pay period. Leave donations will be kept confidential unless
otherwise requested by the donor.
Section 4.78 Paid Parental Leave (Created 11/28/2017)
Effective December 1, 2018, employees who qualify for Family and Medical Leave Act
(FMLA) coverage under Section 4-65 of this Article will be eligible to receive a maximum of
240 hours of paid parental leave during each 12 rolling monthly period for the birth, adoption, or
placement of a foster child. Paid Parental Leave will run concurrently with the employee’s Family
and Medical Leave.
Paid parental leave will be provided to any qualifying full-time or permanent part-time
employee who is a new birth parent, spouse of a birth parent, domestic partner, or foster parent
of a child age 18 or younger.
If both parents are employed by the Town at the time of the child’s birth, adoption,
or foster care placement, the couple will be entitled to a total of six weeks of paid parental leave
combined. The birth or placement of more than one child (i.e. twins or siblings) at the same time
does not entitle the employee to additional paid leave above the 240 hour maximum. Adoption of
a stepchild or stepchildren does not qualify for paid parental leave.
An employee requesting paid parental leave must complete a Paid Parental Leave Request
Form at least sixty days in advance of taking such leave, if practicable, along with FMLA forms
that must be completed by the parent’s medical provider, or legal representative in the case of
adoption or foster care placement. Both forms are available from the Human Resources
4-34
Department and should be submitted to that Department. Leave must be approved by the
employee’s department head, the Human Resources Director, and the Town Manager.
Payment will be made to the employee’s bank account via direct deposit on the Town’s
biweekly payroll schedule, and employees who are on paid parental leave will receive pay for
their regular, biweekly hours, not to exceed 240 hours in any 12 rolling month period. The
employee’s usual payroll deductions and contributions, and the Town’s usual payroll
contributions, will continue.
All benefits provided to the employee per Town policy prior to paid parental leave will
continue. Any employee contributions for benefits, 401k loans, or other employee obligations
normally paid by the employee through payroll deduction, shall continue.
If a holiday occurs during the paid parental leave period, the holiday will be paid and will
not count against the paid parental leave hours.
Employees continue to accrue service time, as well as sick and vacation leave, according
to Town policy.
A qualifying employee is entitled to paid parental leave once in each 12 rolling month
period. Leave must be taken immediately after the birth, adoption, or placement of the
child/children, and the 240 hours must be taken consecutively, subject to the exception provided
for in the next paragraph of this Section. All unused leave will be forfeited upon the employee’s
return to work. If both parents are employed by the Town, the couple will be entitled to a total of
240 hours of paid parental leave combined, and only one parent will receive FMLA leave
running concurrently with the paid parental leave.
An employee may request intermittent paid parental leave or a delayed start of the leave
period. Such requests must be made to Human Resources at least sixty days in advance of taking
leave, if practicable, and may be approved by the Department Head, Human Resources Director,
and Town Manager in the Town’s discretion. All paid parental leave must be taken within 12
months of the birth or placement of the child/children.
An employee is expected to return to work at the end of his/her approved paid parental
leave, unless the employee has received approval to extend the time away from work with other
types of leave. Employees should notify Human Resources and their Supervisor or Department
Head if there is any anticipated change in their original return-to-work date. Nursing mothers
who return to work will receive paid break times and private space to pump breast milk, as well
as access to refrigerated storage.
4-35
ARTICLE VIII. SEPARATION AND REINSTATEMENT
Section 4-79 Types of Separations
All separations of employees from positions in the service of the Town shall be designated as one of
the following types and shall be accomplished in the manner indicated: resignation, reduction in
force, disability, voluntary retirement, dismissal, or death.
Section 4-80 Resignation
An employee may resign by submitting the reasons for resignation and the effective date in writing
to the immediate supervisor as far in advance as possible. In all instances, the minimum notice
requirement is two weeks; 30 days notice is required for department heads. Failure to provide
minimum notice shall result in forfeit of payment for accumulated annual leave unless the notice is
waived upon recommendation of the Department Head and approval by the Town Manager.
Three consecutive days of absence without contacting the immediate supervisor or Department
Head may be considered to be a voluntary resignation. Sick leave will only be approved during the
final two weeks of a notice with a physician's certification or comparable documentation.
Participation in a work stoppage or strike against the Town by an employee(s) may be considered a
resignation by the employee.
Section 4-81 Reduction in Force
In the event that a reduction in force becomes necessary, consideration shall be given to the quality
of each employee's performance, organizational needs, and seniority in determining those
employees to be retained. Employees who are separated because of a reduction in force shall be
given at least two weeks notice of the anticipated action. No regular employee shall be separated
because of a reduction in force while there are temporary or probationary employees serving in the
same class in the department, unless the regular employee is not willing to transfer to the position
held by the temporary or probationary employee.
Section 4-82 Disability
Subject to the remaining provisions of this section, an employee who cannot perform satisfactorily
the essential duties because of a physical or mental disability may be separated. The employee or
the Town may initiate action. In all cases, such action must be accompanied by medical evidence
acceptable to the Town Manager. If and to the extent that an employee has a disability as defined
by the ADA, and if requested by the employee, the Town and employee must fully explore
reasonable accommodation(s) which might permit the employee to perform the essential duties of
the employee’s position. Reasonable accommodation may include transfer to another vacant
position if the employee is able and qualified to perform the essential duties of that other position.
The Town may require an examination, at the Town's expense, to be performed by a physician of
the Town's choice.
An employee who has been granted leave without pay under Section 4-67 for reasons of personal
disability shall not be subject to termination under this section during the authorized leave without
pay period.
4-36
An employee who is disabled and who is out on accrued sick leave or annual leave shall not be
subject to termination under this section until all such accrued leave has been exhausted; provided
that, the Town may terminate a disabled employee who has remained out on such accrued leave for
a period of twelve months. In such a case, the employee shall be compensated for any remaining
accrued sick leave unless such leave is converted upon retirement into service credit consistent with
the provisions of the North Carolina Local Government Employees’ Retirement System.
An employee who is disabled and who is out on workers’ compensation leave shall not be subject
to termination under this section until after the employee has been certified by a physician as having
reached maximum medical improvement; provided that, the Town may terminate a disabled
employee who has remained on workers’ compensation leave for a period of twelve months. In
such a case, the employee shall be compensated for any remaining accrued sick leave unless such
leave is converted upon retirement into service credit consistent with the provisions of the North
Carolina Local Government Employees’ Retirement System.
Section 4-83 Voluntary Retirement
An employee who meets the conditions set forth under the provision of the North Carolina Local
Government Employee's Retirement System may elect to retire and receive all benefits earned under
the retirement plan.

Separation shall be effective as of the date of death. All compensation due shall be paid to the
estate of the employee.
Section 4-85 Dismissal
An employee may be dismissed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of Article IX.
Section 4-86 Reinstatement
An employee who resigns while in good standing or who is separated because of reduction in force
may be reinstated within one year of the date of separation, upon recommendation of the
Department Head, and upon approval of the Town Manager. An employee who is reinstated in this
manner shall be re-credited with his or her previously accrued sick leave and previous service.
Section 4-87 Rehiring
An employee who resigns while in good standing may be rehired with the approval of the Town
Manager, and may be regarded as a new employee, subject to all of the provisions of rules and
regulations of this policy. An employee in good standing who is separated due to a reduction in
force shall be given the first opportunity to be rehired in the same or a similar position.
4-37
ARTICLE IX. DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS AND NONDISCIPLINARY ACTIONS
Section 4-88 Disciplinary Action: By Whom Imposed and Reasons Therefore
(a) Disciplinary action may be taken against an employee by that employee’s department head,
except that only the manager may dismiss an employee or suspend an employee without pay for
more than five working days. (Amend. 11/15/2005)
(b) Subject to Subsection 4-21, disciplinary action may be taken against an employee only
for cause.
Section 4-89 Warnings Before Disciplinary Action
Whenever practicable, before disciplinary action is taken, an employee should be counseled
that a particular course of conduct or pattern of performance will result in disciplinary action, and
efforts should be made to assist the employee in improving his conduct or performance.
Section 4-90 Notification of Disciplinary Action
Before any discipline is imposed, an employee shall be informed by his department head of
the precise nature of the discipline, the reasons for it, and the date and time the discipline is to
become effective. Whenever practicable this notification shall be given in writing before the
discipline is imposed, and if this is not possible, then this written notification shall be given to the
employee as soon thereafter as is feasible.
Section 4-91 Effective Date and Time of Disciplinary Action
Except when a department head determines that any delay in the imposition of discipline
would diminish its effectiveness or would be detrimental to the Town, employees, or others, the
department head shall provide the employee with at least three days notice before proposed
disciplinary action is to take effect.
Section 4-92 Recommendations to Manager of Disciplinary Actions Including Dismissal
(a) A department head may recommend to the Manager that disciplinary action that is
solely within the prerogative of the Manager (including dismissal) be taken. Such a
recommendation shall be made in writing, and a copy shall be given to the affected employee. If the
recommendation is for dismissal, it shall contain a proposed dismissal date, which shall be not less
than two weeks after a copy of the recommendation is furnished to the affected employee.
(b) If a department head suspends an employee without pay for five days and recommends to the
manager that the employee be dismissed, the manager may, upon the recommendation of the
department head, continue the suspension without pay until the termination date or pending the
outcome of the appeal (if any).The Manager shall notify the employee and the department head in
writing at the earliest possible time that the suspension is being confirmed. (Amend. 11/15/2005)
4-38
Section 4-93 Appeal of Disciplinary Action; Referral to Personnel Advisory Committee
(a) An employee may appeal any disciplinary action or proposed disciplinary action to
the Manager. The appeal may be decided by the Manager after a review of any written documents
submitted by the appellant and the department head who imposed the discipline, or at the request of
the appellant, department head, or Manager, a hearing may be held by the Manager in accordance
with this section. If requested in writing by the employee, the hearing shall be open to the public,
except that the manager may close the hearing, or portions of the hearing, if and to the extent that
the manager concludes that such closure is necessary to preserve the personnel privacy rights of any
employee, including without limitation the department head who has recommended or imposed the
discipline that is the subject of the appeal.
(b) An appeal may be perfected within three days after the employee receives notice of
the proposed disciplinary action, or, if the disciplinary action becomes effective immediately within
three days after such disciplinary action becomes effective, unless extenuating circumstances
prohibit meeting the three-day deadline. An appeal is perfected by filing with the Manager a
written notice of appeal, briefly stating the action appealed from and the reasons for the appeal. A
copy of this notice of appeal shall be furnished to the department head imposing or recommending
the discipline.
(c) If the discipline has not taken effect at the time an appeal is perfected, then the appeal
stays the disciplinary action until after the appeal is decided. However, this shall not preclude the
Manager from extending a suspension without pay under Section 4-91(b).
(d) An appeal shall be considered by the Manager at the earliest convenient time, but generally not
later than ten days after the appeal is filed. If a hearing is requested, the employee shall be given at
least three days notice of the date, time, and location of the hearing.
(e) If a hearing is requested, then, unless the appellant is a department head, the
department head shall present the reasons why the discipline is justified. The employee shall have
an opportunity to ask questions, present evidence, or otherwise attempt to convince the Manager
that the disciplinary action is not justified. When the appellant is a department head, the Manager
shall present to the department head the reasons for the discipline, and the department head shall
then have an opportunity to respond in the same manner as other appellants.
(f) With respect to appeals of disciplinary actions, if the Manager chooses to do so, the Manager
may obtain the recommendation of the non-employee members of the Personnel Advisory
Committee (PAC) created pursuant to Section 4-99 before deciding the appeal. The Manager shall
furnish to the PAC such information as is available to him regarding the appeal, and if an oral
hearing is provided, the members of the PAC shall have the opportunity to be present. The PAC
shall make its recommendation to the Manager within the time frame specified by the Manager.
(g) The appellant may be represented by counsel if the Manager is notified not later than
five days prior to the date of the hearing. If the employee intends to be represented by counsel, the
department head shall be so notified by the Manager and the town may then provide counsel to the
department head if the department head so requests. The Manager shall attempt to notify the
employee at least three days prior to the hearing if the department head will be represented by
counsel.
(h) The Manager shall decide the appeal as expeditiously as possible, and, in particular,
4-39
every effort shall be made to decide any appeal of disciplinary action that has not yet taken effect
before the proposed effective date of such action. The Manager may extend the proposed effective
date of disciplinary action in order to meet this objective.
(i) The Manager may take any action with respect to disciplinary appeals that he deems
appropriate consistent with this chapter, including (but not limited to) increasing or decreasing the
disciplinary sanction. The Manager shall inform the appellant of his or her decision and the reasons
for it. The Manager's decision shall be final.
(j) If an employee has been suspended without pay and the Manager finds the
suspension to have been unwarranted, in whole or in part, then the employee shall be entitled to
receive lost wages and benefits accordingly.
(k) If the Manager sustains and employee's appeal (at least in substantial part) then the
Manager may recommend that the Board of Aldermen authorize partial or full payment of fees
incurred by the employee for representation.
Section 4-94 Nondisciplinary Suspension
(a) With the approval of the Manager, a department head may impose a nondisciplinary
suspension (with or without pay) on any employee who has been accused of some action which, if
the accusation is substantiated, would constitute cause for disciplinary action. There may be no
appeal from nondisciplinary suspension.
(b) If a nondisciplinary suspension is imposed, the employee shall be notified in writing:
(1) That the suspension is nondisciplinary ;
(2) That the suspension is temporary in nature (for example, pending the outcome
of a criminal trial or internal investigation);
(3) What the accusations or allegations are that triggered the nondisciplinary
suspension; and
(4) Why a nondisciplinary suspension has been imposed on this particular case.
(c) If it is determined that the charges are not substantiated, then the employee shall be reinstated
with full recovery of any lost wages or benefits. If an employee has been accused of a criminal
offense but is not convicted of the offense accused, the outcome of the criminal process may be
considered (but shall not be determinative) in determining whether the accusations leading to the
suspension have been substantiated.
(d) If it is determined that the charges are substantiated, then appropriate disciplinary
action may be taken in accordance with this article. If any employee has been suspended without
pay pending the outcome of the investigation and the employee is not dismissed and the discipline
imposed is less severe than the suspension without pay the employee has already experienced, the
employee may be entitled to partial recovery of lost wages or benefits, according to the discipline
imposed.
Section 4-95 Department Heads
4-40
The Manager may take disciplinary action against or impose nondisciplinary suspensions
upon department heads. In taking such actions, the Manager shall follow the procedures set forth in
Article IX for disciplinary actions or nondisciplinary suspensions initiated by department heads to
the maximum extent feasible (i.e., steps involving department head recommendations to the
Manager do not apply).
Section 4-96. Board Access to Records of Disciplinary Actions
Pursuant to G.S. 160A-168(c)(5), the mayor or a member of the board of aldermen may have
access to the records of any disciplinary action that is referred to the Personnel Advisory
Committee. A request for access shall be made to the Town Manager and may be made at any time
after the completion of the disciplinary appeals process.
Section 4-96.1 Suspension Without Pay of Exempt Employees (Amend. 11/15/2005)
(a) Disciplinary sanctions and nondisciplinary suspensions may not be imposed to reduce the salary
of any employee who is exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act for
any workweek in which the employee performs work, except as set forth in subdivisions (1) and (2)
of this subsection. The provisions of this section shall control to the extent there is any conflict with
the other provisions of this chapter relating to disciplinary sanctions, including disciplinary
suspensions without pay, and the provisions of Section 4-93 relating to nondisciplinary suspensions
without pay.
(1) Deductions from pay may be made for penalties imposed in good faith for infractions
of safety rules of major significance.
(2) Deductions from pay may be made for unpaid disciplinary suspensions of one or more
full days imposed in good faith for infractions of written workplace conduct rules applicable
to all employees.
(b) When a department head imposes a disciplinary sanction involving a reduction in pay, such as a
suspension without pay, or imposes a nondisciplinary suspension without pay under Section 4-93,
such action shall be reviewed by the human resources director to ensure compliance with applicable
provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The salaries of exempt employees shall not be reduced
contrary to the provisions of that Act, but the actions of the department head shall otherwise remain
in effect, subject to the remaining provisions of this chapter.
4-41
Article X
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section 4-97 Purpose and Scope
(a) The purpose of this grievance procedure is to:
(1) Provide employees a procedure by which their complaints can be considered
rapidly, fairly, and without reprisal, and by which their concerns can be
addressed at the lowest possible level.
(2) Encourage employees to express themselves about the conditions of work
which affect them as employees.
(3) Promote better understanding of policies, practices, and procedures that affect
employees.
(4) Instill in employees confidence that personnel actions are taken in accordance
with established, fair, and uniform policies and procedures.
(5) Increase supervisory responsibility for maintaining effective communication
with employees.
(b) The procedures set forth in this article for the consideration of grievances do not
apply to grievances resulting from:
(1) Disciplinary actions (the appeal process for disciplinary actions is set forth in
Section 4-92 this chapter).
(2) Oral reprimands or oral performance evaluations.
Section 4-98 Procedure
(a) In General. Subject to subsections (f) and (g), when an employee or group of employees has a
grievance, the successive steps described in subsections (b) through (e) are to be taken. The number
of days indicated at each level should be considered as the maximum number of working days
unless provided for otherwise, and every effort shall be made to expedite the process. However,
when mutually agreed upon, the time limits given below may be extended. Unless a time extension
is agreed upon or extended under this section, a grievance may be dismissed summarily if not
timely filed.
(b) Informal Discussion. Before filing a formal grievance, the employee or group of
employees must have discussed the problem with the supervisor. This assures that the supervisor
knows about and has had the opportunity to consider and investigate the problem and to resolve the
problem informally. The employee must request this meeting within five working days of the event
or condition complained of, except that ongoing conditions are not subject to this deadline.
(c) Step One. The first step of the formal grievance procedure is for the employee to file
a written notice with the immediate supervisor. This notice must be filed within five working days
of the employee's meeting with the supervisor to discuss the issue.
4-42
(1) Grievances may be filed by completing step 1 of a Grievance Form (copies of
which shall be available from the Human Resources Director), or may be filed in letter or
narrative form. In either case, the grievance must, to the extent reasonably
possible, be specific, stating the problem or complaint and what solution or
remedy the employee expects. (The Human Resources Department will assist an employee
in correct filing procedures, if desired.)
(2) The supervisor will investigate the matter and respond in writing to the
employee within five working days of receipt of the formal grievance. The
grievance and the supervisor's response shall be forwarded to the Human Resources Director
by the supervisor. The supervisor may seek the assistance of the
Human Resources Director or department head in complying with this requirement.
(d) Step Two. If the grievance is not settled to the employee's satisfaction at step 1, the
employee may proceed to step 2. The employee must file with the department head either the
Grievance Form, with the step 2 section completed, or a letter or narrative, within five working days
of receiving the supervisor's written response under step one.
(1) If the solution or remedy desired has altered since the initial grievance, or if
there is a particular area of disagreement with the supervisor's written
response, this should be specified by the employee along with a request
for consideration of the grievance by the department head.
(2) The department head will review the issues in the grievance, meet with the
employee, and respond in writing to the employee within five working days of
the meeting. The grievance and the department head's response shall be
forwarded to the Human Resources Director by the department head.
(e) Step Three. If the grievance is not settled to the employee's satisfaction at step 2, the
employee may proceed to step 3, appeal to the Town Manager. The employee must file with the
Town Manager, using either the Grievance Form with step 3 section completed, or a letter or
narrative, within ten working days of receipt of the department head's written response.
(1) As in previous steps, the employee should be specific as to the solution or
further remedy desired and concerning particular points of disagreement with
supervisory and department head responses.
(2) The Manager will investigate the matter, meet with the employee and
department head, either separately or together, and respond in writing within ten workings
days of receipt of the formal grievance, unless the Manager refers the grievance to the
mediation process and/or the Personnel Advisory Committee.
(f) Discrimination. If a grievance involves a claim of discrimination based on age, race, color,
religion, sex, national origin, political affiliation, non-disqualifying disability, sexual orientation,
marital status, gender identity, or gender expression (including a claim of sexual harassment),
informal discussion shall not be required, and the employee may initiate the grievance procedure at
step two if the supervisor's conduct is involved in the grievance or at step three if the department
head's conduct is involved in the grievance. Alternatively, claims of racial or sexual discrimination
4-43
may be reported by any employee directly to the Human Resources Director, who may initiate a
grievance on behalf of the employee or take any other action deemed appropriate.
(g) When Supervisor Is Department Head or Manager. If the immediate supervisor of
the aggrieved employee is a department head, then the employee may proceed directly to step two
of the grievance procedure within five days after meeting with the department head for the informal
discussion required under section 4-96(b). If the aggrieved employee is a department head, then the
employee may proceed directly to step three of the grievance procedure within five days after
meeting with the manager for the informal discussion required under section 97(b).
(h) Board Access to Records of Grievances. Pursuant to G.S. 160A-168(c)(5), the
mayor or any member of the board of aldermen may have access to the records of any grievance
that is referred to the personnel advisory committee. A request for access shall be made to the Town
Manager and may be made at any time after the completion of the grievance appeals process.
Section 4-99 Mediation.
(a) Any grievance may be referred to a mediation process under the following
circumstances:
(1) After a grievance has been filed under step one or two of the grievance
process, and before a decision has been reached by the supervisor or
department head, respectively, the Town Manager may refer the grievance to the
mediation process as set forth below.
(2) After a grievance has been filed under step three of the grievance process, the
Manager, may elect to refer the grievance to the mediation process as set forth below.
(b) For purposes of this section, the term mediation refers to a process in which a trained
mediator seeks to help the parties to resolve their differences in a mutually acceptable fashion. (The
mediator does not impose a solution or issue a "decision.")
(c) The town shall arrange for qualified mediators to be available to perform the
mediation services called for under this article. All expenses of such mediation services shall be
borne by the town.
(d) While mediation is going on, deadlines established for various stages of the
grievance process are suspended. Such deadlines will come into play again if the grievance is not
settled by mediation, except that in no case shall a deadline for the next step in the grievance
process occur less than three days after the date of the mediator's notification to the employee and
department head or supervisor of the end of the mediation process.
(e) If mediation resolves the grievance, the mediator will draft a document outlining the
terms of the agreement. The document will be signed by the parties and by the mediator and
forwarded to the Human Resources Director. At this point, the grievance will be considered closed.
If the parties do not reach agreement, the mediator will notify the Human Resources Director and
the parties themselves that the mediation process is completed. Unless the employee then withdraws
the grievance, the grievance process shall continue as set forth in this section.
4-44
(f) The mediation process is confidential, and mediators may not disclose information discussed
during mediation sessions. Documents generated as part of the mediation process will not be
admissible as evidence in future proceedings and are considered confidential. Additionally, no
offers of compromise made during mediation may be referred to in subsequent formal processing of
the grievance.
Section 4-100 Personnel Advisory Committee
(a) The Manager shall appoint a Personnel Advisory Committee (PAC) consisting of
five members, who shall serve at the pleasure of the Manager. Three members shall be persons who
are not currently employed by the Town, and the Manager may also appoint alternative nonemployee
members to sit in the absence of other non-employee members. Two members of the
PAC shall be Town employees, and the Manager may also appoint alternate employee members to
sit in the absence of employee members.
(1) In making appointments to the PAC, the Manager shall endeavor to (i) create a
committee whose membership is reflective of the diversity within the town's
workforce and the Carrboro community; and (ii) appoint at least one member
with training or experience in personnel matters.
(2) The members of the PAC shall select one of their members to serve as chair
and one or more members to act as chair in the absence of the chair.
(3) The members of the PAC shall strictly observe the requirements of the
Personnel Privacy Act (N.C.G.S. 160A-168). Any violation of this act (in
addition to other penalties) shall constitute grounds for the manager to remove
the offending member from the PAC.
(b) Among other duties that may be assigned by the Manager, the PAC shall advise the
Manager in making decisions on grievances in accordance with this section.
(1) Type 1 grievances may be heard only by the three non-employee members of
the PAC, while type 2 grievances may be heard by the full PAC.
(2) The Manager shall determine whether a grievance is a type 1 or type 2
grievance at the time the grievance reaches step 3.
(3) With respect to type 2 grievances, an employee member of the PAC may not
hear a grievance originating from the department where the employee member
is employed.
(c) When a grievance has been filed under step three of the grievance process in
accordance with Section 4-97, the Manager may refer the grievance to the PAC within five days
after it has been filed. Generally, the Manager shall refer a grievance to the PAC only after an
attempt has been made to resolve the grievance through mediation.
(d) When the PAC has been called upon to advise the Manager in connection with a
grievance:
(1) The manager shall provide to the PAC the same written information that is
4-45
available to him or her regarding the grievance, and the PAC shall be present
during the hearing of the grievance by the Manager and may participate in that
hearing.
(2) The deadlines set forth in Section 4-97 are suspended from the time the
Manager refers the grievance to the PAC until the date the PAC provides its
recommendation to the manager.

Section 5-19 Fences Required Around Outdoor Pools (Amend. 7/1/97)
5-8
(a) The provisions of Appendix D of Volume 7 of the North Carolina State Building
Code, entitled “Swimming Pools, Spas and Hot Tubs,” as the same exist on July 1, 1997 or are
thereafter amended, are incorporated herein by reference and hereby adopted.
(b) The provisions referenced in subsection (a) shall apply to all outdoor swimming
pools, spas, and hot tubs (as those terms are defined in the referenced regulations) located within
the corporate limits of the town, regardless of whether such pools, spas, and hot tubs are located
on single-family, two-family, multi-family, or non-residential property and regardless of whether
the same are existing on or constructed after the effective date of this ordinance.
(c) The building inspector may approve barriers that exist on the effective date of this
ordinance to the extent that such barriers substantially comply with the specifications set forth in
Appendix D or provide substantially equivalent protection to such specifications.
Sections 5-20 Reserved Limitation on Use of Designated Right-of-Way (Amend. 11/20/07,
Repealed 11/22/2011)
(a) Findings.
1. The provisions of this section are intended to respond to the issues raised
at a community meeting attended by approximately 30 residents and 9
Carrboro staff on July 26, 2007. This meeting was requested by neighbors
to discuss issues associated with the daily gathering of significant numbers
of individuals at or near the intersection of Davie Road and Jones Ferry
Road. Additional input was received by the Board of Aldermen at a
public hearing held on October 23, 2007.
2. A substantial number of day laborers assemble within the area described
in subsection (d) in the morning hours seeking work or waiting to be
picked up for work. The problems described in subsection (a)(3) of this
section do not typically occur during the morning hours. Rather, these
problems tend to occur after 11:00 a.m. when individuals who are not
looking for work gather in this area.
3. The following problems are directly associated with the congregation of
individuals in the area described in subsection (d) between the hours of
11:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. and would be greatly reduced or eliminated if
compliance with the provisions of this section is achieved:
a. The accumulation of litter and trash, which then is blown into
the streets and neighboring properties;
b. Public consumption of alcohol;
c. Public urination and defecation;
d. Trespassing on neighboring properties;
e. Verbal harassment or intimidation of females in the area;
5-9
f. Diversion of police resources (police responded to roughly 60
complaints in the area of the intersection of Davie Road and
Jones Ferry Road between May 1 and September 18, 2007).
4. The problems identified in subsection (a)(3) cannot practically be resolved
by enforcement of existing statutes or ordinances.
(b) Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this section is (i) to ensure that the right-ofway
area specified in subsection (d) remains open and unobstructed so that it can
serve its principal function, i.e. to allow for the safe and convenient passage of
motor vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle traffic, and (ii) to eliminate the threats to
the public health, safety, and welfare that have occurred as described in
subsection (a) of this section arising out of the use of this area by persons for
purposes unrelated to its principal function.
(c) Except as provided herein, no person may stand, sit, recline, linger, or otherwise
remain within the area designated in subsection (d) between the hours of 11:00
a.m. and 5:00 a.m. This prohibition shall not apply to persons occupying motor
vehicles, riding on bicycles, walking, or otherwise moving through such area,
while such persons are actually engaged in the process of moving from a point
outside such area, through such area, to another point outside such area.
(d) The area covered by this section shall be (i) that area within the public street
right-of-way of Davie Road beginning at the intersection of the right-of-way of
Jones Ferry Road and running in a northerly direction down Davie Road a
distance of 200 feet; and (ii) that area within the northern half of the Jones Ferry
Road right-of-way (i.e. north of the centerline of Jones Ferry Road) that begins at
a point 200 feet east of the point where the centerline of Davie Road meets the
right-of-way of Jones Ferry Road and that extends to a point that is 200 feet west
of the point where the centerline of Davie Road meets the right-of-way of Jones
Ferry Road.
(e) To the extent practicable, signs shall be posted along the areas covered under this
section that provide notice of the provisions of this section.
Section 5-20.1 Application of Nutrients to Two Acres or More of Land Area. (Amend. 6/2/09)
(a) No person may apply nutrients, including fertilizer, bio solids, or compost, to any
land area that exceeds two acres in size, or cause, suffer, or permit the application of such
nutrients to any land area that exceeds two acres in size under the control of such person, unless:
(1) The person who applies the nutrients has attended and completed nutrient
management training as described in subsection (b) of this section or works under the direct
supervision of someone who has attended and completed such training; or
(2) The nutrients are applied in accordance with a nutrient management plan prepared
and approved as provided in subsections (c) or (d) of this section.

Article III
WATER CONSERVATION RESTRICTIONS
(Amended 6/2/09)
Section 5-22. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to:
(1) Reduce the rate of increase in overall water use through year-round water
conversation practices that will help maximize the community’s existing and planned water
supply sources and help reduce seasonal peak day demands that result in the need for costly
expansion of water treatment, storage, and transmission facilities. Such year-round practices
shall include:
a. Reducing the indoor water waste by encouraging the installation and maintenance
of ultra-low flow toilets, faucet aerators, low-flow showerheads and similar devices, as well as
other creative and commonsense indoor conservation practices.
b. Reducing irrigation and irrigation-related water waste without sacrificing
landscape quality through the cultivation of lower water use plants; improved landscape design
and planting practices; more efficient watering practices; and improved irrigation system design
and maintenance.
c. Increasing the use of non-potable water, as permitted by appropriate public health
regulations, for irrigation and other uses that do not require water of potable quality.
(2) Provide an orderly process for reducing community-wide water demands during
periods of drought or other naturally occurring causes of water shortages; and
(3) Provide an orderly process for reducing community-wide water demands during
periods of water shortages due to natural disaster (other than drought), major OWASA facilities
failure, or other unexpected and sudden loss of water supply, treatment, or distribution capacity
that constitutes a water supply emergency.

Section 5-27. Year Round Policy and Practice.
It shall be OWASA’s policy and practice to publicize periodically water conservation
methods, including but not limited to, methods of conserving water both indoors and outdoors;
methods of collecting and storing harvested water in appropriate devices, such as rain barrels and
cisterns; as well as information about the availability, feasibility and allowable uses of reclaimed
water from OWASA. It shall be OWASA’s policy to strongly encourage and promote the
following voluntary conservation measures year round, regardless of water supply conditions:
(1) Operate dishwashers and clothes washers only when loaded to their maximum
capacity or at water level settings appropriate for the size of the load.
(2) Where not otherwise required, install ultra-low flow toilets, tank dams, flow
restrictors (aerators) and low-flow showerheads.
(3) Repair and maintain plumbing systems to prevent water leaks.
(4) Use harvested rainwater and/or reclaimed water for indoor and outdoor purposes
where allowable and practical.
Section 5-28. Determination by OWASA of a Water Supply Shortage or Emergency
(a) Draught Condition Shortage.
(1) OWASA’s drought response strategy and Water Supply Shortage declarations
will be guided primarily by the risk that OWASA’s water supplies will decline to 20 percent or
less of total storage capacity within the next 12-month period. A Stage One Water Shortage
declaration will generally correspond to a two percent (or greater) risk that reservoir levels will
5-20
decline to 20 percent or less of total storage capacity within the next 12 months; provided,
however, that in making such a determination, OWASA will also consider the actual and
projected severity of the ongoing drought relative to historical droughts included in OWASA’s
water supply simulation models; existing and anticipated demand, including expected customer
response to water use restrictions; availability of supplemental supplies, including water
purchases from neighboring communities; regional water supply conditions, including, but not
limited to, the concurrent drought response status of neighboring jurisdictions; guidance or
directives from the State of North Carolina; and other elements of reasonable professional
judgment and management.
(2) More severe Water Supply Shortage Stages will subsequently be declared if the
risk level increases and/or if other factors indicate that further action is needed. Similarly,
OWASA will reduce the severity of, or rescind, a Water Supply Shortage declaration as the risk
level and related factors improve.
(b) Water Treatment, Storage, or Distribution Capacity Shortage. In addition to
conditions caused by drought, OWASA may declare a Water Supply Shortage or Emergency
whenever customer demand – as averaged over three consecutive days – exceeds 85 percent of
OWASA’s capability of treating and delivering water. The stage and duration of such a Water
Supply Shortage or Emergency shall be guided by the degree to which customer demands
approach or exceed OWASA’s capacity to meet those demands, and by the degree to which
conservation efforts successfully reduce short-term demands.
(c) Disasters and Catastrophic Equipment or Plant Failure Shortage. Any other
circumstances, including service losses caused by equipment or facility failure, human error,
deliberate act, weather, or other natural disaster, which constrain OWASA’s water supply,
treatment, or distribution capacity to less than that reasonably needed by its customers, shall
constitute a Water Supply Shortage up to and including a Water Supply Emergency, requiring
immediate action by OWASA.

Section 5-29. Required Actions Under Water Supply Shortage or Emergency Conditions
(a) In the event of a water supply shortage, OWASA shall, using its best professional
judgment, determine which of the following stages is the most appropriate response to the
estimated level of risk considering factors in Subsection 5-27(a).
(b) Stage One Water Shortage. In the event that OWASA declares a Stage One
Water Shortage, OWASA shall advise the Mayors of Carrboro and Chapel Hill and the Chair of
the Orange County Board of Commissioners of its declaration and shall request that they issue
Proclamations of a Stage One Water Supply Shortage. Upon the issuance of such a proclamation
by the Mayor, the following actions shall be taken with the goal of reducing overall water
demand by ten (10) percent:
(1) Spray irrigation of turf grass using OWASA-supplied potable water shall not
occur more than one day per week with a maximum of one-half inch of water applied to plant
material in any given week. Odd-numbered properties shall be allowed to spray irrigate only on
Tuesdays; even-numbered properties shall be allowed to spray irrigate only on Thursdays. Spray
irrigation of turf grass shall occur only between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 10:00 a.m. Owners of
public purpose athletic fields, recreational fields, and/or public purpose botanical sites shall not
be subject to the limitations of this subsection (b)(1) if those facilities are operated in compliance
with an OWASA-approved Water Conservation Plan.
(2) Spray irrigation of non-turf plant materials may occur up to three days per week
as provided under the year-round requirements specified in Subsection 5-25(a)(1). I
(3) Irrigation of non-turf plant materials by underground, drip irrigation, micro spray,
low precipitation bubblers, soaker hose systems with automatic shutoffs, or by hand held hoses
or watering cans may occur at any time or frequency.
(c) Stage Two Water Shortage. In the event that OWASA declares a Stage Two
Water Shortage, OWASA shall advise the Mayors of Carrboro and Chapel Hill and the Chair of
the Orange County Board of Commissioners of its declaration and shall request that they issue
Proclamations of a Stage Two Water Supply Shortage, if not already issued. Upon the issuance
of such a proclamation by the Mayor, the following actions shall be taken with the goal of
reducing overall water demand by fifteen (15) percent:
(1) Spray irrigation of turf grass with OWASA-supplied potable water shall not be
permitted, except at public purpose athletic and recreational fields and public purpose botanical
sites operating under OWASA-approved Water Conservation Plans.
(2) Spray irrigation of non-turf plant materials shall not occur more than one day per
week according to the schedule specified in Subsection 28(b)(1) and in quantities of no more
than ½ inch per week, except at public purpose botanical sites operating under OWASA
approved Water Conservation Plans.
(3) Irrigation of non-turf plant material by underground, drip irrigation, micro spray,
low precipitation bubblers, soaker hose systems with automatic shutoffs, tree or shrub watering
bags, or by hand held hoses or watering cans may occur at any time or frequency.
5-22
(4) No OWASA-supplied potable water shall be used to re-fill ornamental fountains,
ponds, and like devices; provided, however, that OWASA water may be used to fill and re-fill
bird baths and other backyard-scale facilities used to support wildlife.
(5) No OWASA-supplied potable water shall be used for washing vehicles, except at
commercial or institutional car washes in which at least 50 percent of the water has either been
recycled, is from a non- potable source, or is supplied by a well.
(6) No OWASA-supplied potable water shall be used for cleaning or washing
exterior building surfaces, decks, or paved areas, such as sidewalks, driveways, roadways, and
parking lots. This restriction shall not apply to the cleaning of exterior building surfaces or decks
prior to painting or re-painting.
(7) No OWASA-supplied potable water shall be used for fire department training or
equipment testing unless required by State or Federal regulations.
(d) Stage Three Water Shortage. In the event that OWASA declares a Stage Three
Water Shortage, OWASA shall advise the Mayors of Carrboro and Chapel Hill and the Chair of
the Orange County Board of Commissioners of its declaration and shall request that they issue
Proclamations of a Stage Three Water Supply Shortage, if not already issued. Upon the issuance
of such a proclamation by the Mayor, the following actions shall be taken with the goal of
reducing overall water demand by twenty (20) percent:
(1) The use of OWASA-supplied potable water for heating and/or cooling purposes
shall be reduced in all but the most essential facilities to the extent practical in consideration of
indoor air quality standards, weather conditions, and health and safety requirements.
(2) No OWASA-supplied potable water shall be used for irrigation of turf grass,
except for public purpose athletic and/or recreational fields and public purpose botanical sites
operating under water conservation plans that have been approved by OWASA’s Executive
Director or by his/her designee.
(3) No OWASA-supplied potable water shall be used for irrigating non-turf plant
material unless applied (i) via hand held hoses or watering cans, watering bags, drip irrigation or
soaker hoses, or (ii) at public purpose botanical sites operating under OWASA-approved Water
Conservation Plans.
(4) OWASA-supplied potable water may be used to fill, re-fill, or top off swimming
pools, or to fill or re-fill bird baths and other backyard-scale facilities used to support wildlife.
OWASA supplied potable water shall not be used for any other outdoor purposes, except for
emergency fire suppression or other activities necessary to maintain public health, safety, or
welfare.

transmission of potable OWASA water to neighboring communities, or for other purposes
necessary to maintain public health, safety, or welfare.
(6) No OWASA-supplied potable water may be used for washing any vehicles.
(7) No OWASA-supplied potable water may be used for pressure washing building
exteriors.
5-23
(8) No OWASA-supplied potable water may be used for fire department training or
equipment testing.
(e) Water Supply Emergency. In the event that OWASA declares a Water Supply
Emergency, OWASA shall so advise the Mayors of Carrboro and Chapel Hill and the Chair of
the Orange County Board of Commissioners and shall request that they issue Proclamations of a
Water Supply Emergency. Upon the issuance of such a proclamation by the Mayor, the
following actions shall be taken, in addition to those applicable measures listed above for a
Stage Three Water Shortage:
(1) No OWASA-supplied potable water may be used for any outdoor purposes other
than emergency fire suppression or other activities necessary to maintain public health, safety, or
welfare.
(2) No OWASA-supplied potable water shall be used to fill, refill or top off the water
level in any private or public purpose swimming pool.
(3) No OWASA-supplied potable water shall be used for the flushing or pressure
testing of new distribution lines unless that water is returned to the OWASA water supply system
through methods approved by OWASA. This restriction shall not apply to the testing of inbuilding
fire control sprinkler systems
(4) The use of OWASA-supplied potable water for heating and/or cooling purposes
shall be reduced in all but the most essential facilities to the extent practical in consideration of
indoor air quality standards, weather conditions, and health and safety requirements.
(5) Water service may be discontinued or reduced to designated users or in
designated portions of the OWASA service area in order to preserve the availability of water for
essential public health and safety requirements, such as fire protection, hospitals, clinics, and
other critical community needs.
(f) Exceptions. Notwithstanding the restrictions specified in Subsections (b), (c), (d),
and (e) of this section, the protection of public health, safety, and welfare may, under special
circumstances, require the use of limited amounts of OWASA-supplied potable water for such
purposes as washing out garbage trucks, cleaning up hazardous or other materials. Such uses
shall be permitted during declared Water Shortages or Emergencies, provided that other practical
alternatives are not available and water is used in the least practical amount.

TO STORM SEWER SYSTEM
(Amend. 11/18/08)
Section 5-30. Purpose
The purpose of this article is to regulate illicit discharges into and connections to the
storm sewer system in order to comply with the requirements of the town’s National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System Permit.
Section 5-31. Definitions
Unless otherwise specifically provided, or unless otherwise clearly indicated by the
context, the words and phrases defined in this section shall have the meaning indicated when
used in this article.
(1) Administrator. The person assigned by the manager to enforce or otherwise
perform any duties required under this article.
(2) Discharge. To put, place, dump, spill, pump, pour, or otherwise deposit any solid
or liquid material.
(3) Illicit connection. Any drain, pipe, or other constructed or manufactured
conveyance through which or by which any liquids, other than stormwater or those liquids listed
in subsection 15-32(b), are conveyed and discharged directly into the storm sewer system or a
surface water.
(4) Illicit discharge. A discharge that violates Subsection 5-32 (a)
(5) Pollutant. Anything which causes or contributes to pollution. Pollutants may
include, but are not limited to: paints, varnishes, and solvents; soaps and cleaning solutions;
kerosene, gasoline, oil and other automotive fluids; liquid and solid wastes and yard wastes;
refuse, rubbish, garbage, litter, or other discarded or abandoned objects or accumulations, to the
extent that the same may cause or contribute to pollution; pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers;
hazardous substances and wastes; sewage, sewage sludge, fecal coliform and pathogens;
dissolved and particulate metals; animal wastes; dredged spoil; filter backwash; chemical wastes;
biological materials; toxic materials; radioactive materials; wrecked or discarded equipment;
sand; dirt; ashes and incinerator residue; wastes and residues that result from constructing a
building or structure; and noxious or offensive matter of any kind.
(6) Pollution. The alteration of the physical, thermal, chemical, or biological quality
of, or the contamination of, any water of the State or of the United States, that renders the water
harmful, detrimental, or injurious to humans, animal life, vegetation, or property, or to the public
health, safety, or welfare, or impairs the usefulness or the public enjoyment of the water for any
lawful or reasonable purpose.
(7) Storm sewer system. A system of man-made structures owned by the Town of
Carrboro or the North Carolina Department of Transportation or another State agency that is
designed to collect or convey stormwater, including but not limited to streets (including
associated curbs, gutters, drainage ditches, or swales), inlets, culverts, drainage pipes, detention
or retention basins, and other drainage structures and facilities.
5-25
(8) Stormwater. Any surface flow, runoff, or drainage that occurs during or
following any form of natural precipitation and that results from such precipitation.
(9) Surface waters. All, streams, lakes, and ponds that appear as surface waters on
either the most recent version of the soil survey map prepared by the Natural Resources
Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture or the most recent version
of the 1:24,000 scale (7.5 minute) quadrangle topographic maps prepared by the United States
Geologic Survey (USGS).
Section 5-32. Illicit Discharges Prohibited.
(a) No person may discharge or cause to be discharged, or allow to be discharged from
property under such person’s control, any pollutant directly or indirectly into the storm sewer
system or into surface waters.
(1) A direct discharge occurs when a pollutant is discharged within the physical
limits of the storm sewer system or within the banks of a stream or inside the mean high
water level of a pond or lake.
(2) An indirect discharge occurs when a pollutant is discharged outside the
physical limits of the storm sewer system or outside the banks of a stream or beyond the
mean high water level of a pond or lake but takes place in such a manner or location that
the pollutant is carried into the storm sewer system or surface water in some way other
than by action of the wind or stormwater. By way of illustration without limitation, an
indirect discharge would occur if water from a commercial car wash is discharged onto
the area where the cars are washed and allowed to drain into a public street.
(3) An indirect discharge also occurs when a pollutant is discharged (i) outside
the physical limits of the storm sewer system or outside the banks of a stream or beyond
the mean high water level of a pond or lake, but (ii) with the specific intent that the
pollutant be disposed of by being carried (by the wind or stormwater or otherwise) into
the storm sewer system or a surface water, and (iii) the pollutant or some part or portion
thereof does reach the storm sewer system or surface water. By way of illustration
without limitation, dumping used oil near the edge of a stream with the intent that the
next rain carry the oil into the stream constitutes an indirect discharge within the meaning
of this subsection.
(b) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this article, the following shall not be
regarded as constituting an illicit discharge:
(1) Water line or hydrant flushing;
(2) Landscape or garden irrigation or lawn watering;
(3) Diverted stream flows;
(4) Rising ground waters;
(5) Uncontaminated ground water infiltration (as defined at 40 CFR 35.2005(20));
(6) Uncontaminated pumped ground water;
(7) Discharges from potable water sources;
(8) Foundation drains;
(9) Air conditioning condensation;
(10) Springs;
(11) Water from crawl space pumps;
5-26
(12) Footing drains;
(13) Individual residential car washing or charity car washing;
(14) Flows from riparian habitats and wetlands;
(15) Dechlorinated swimming pool discharges;
(16) Street wash water;
(17) Flows from fighting fires
(18) Other non-stormwater discharges for which a valid NPDES discharge permit has
been approved and issued by the State of North Carolina.
Section 5-33. Illicit Connections Prohibited
(a) No person may cause, suffer, or permit on property under such person’s control any
illicit connection to the storm sewer system, including without limitation connections of drains or
lines that convey sewage, process wastewater, wastewater from washing machines, wash water
from commercial vehicle washing or steam cleaning, or water from indoor sinks or floor drains.
(b) Subject to subsection (c), if, on the effective date of this article, an illicit connection
as defined in this article exists, then such situation shall not be considered a violation of this
article until ninety (90) days after the town mails by first class mail written notice to the owner
(according to the most recent property records) of the property where the condition exists,
informing such owner of the nature of the violation and what must be done to correct it.
(c) The ninety day grace period provided for in subsection (b) of this section shall not
apply if the administrator concludes that an illicit connection:
(1) Is likely to result in the discharge of hazardous materials or otherwise pose an
immediate threat to health or safety, or is likely to result in immediate injury to real or personal
property, natural resources, wildlife, or habitat; or
(2) Was made in violation of any applicable statute, regulation, or ordinance.
Section 5-34 Inspections
(a) Upon the presentation of proper credentials, town officers, agents, and employees
engaged in the enforcement of this article shall have a right to enter on any premises within the
town at all reasonable hours for the purpose of making inspections or carrying out other
enforcement actions under this article.
(b) No person may obstruct or interfere with any town officer, agent, or employee of the
town engaged in the lawful performance of any task authorized or required by this article.
Section 5-35 Enforcement
Penalties and remedies available for enforcement of the provisions of this article are set
forth in Section 5-21 of this chapter. In addition, nothing in this article is intended to preclude
the town from resorting in appropriate circumstances to the procedures set forth in Chapter 11,
Article V, Part 2 of the Town Code dealing with the summary abatement of conditions dangerous
or prejudicial to the public health.

Article V
CARE AND PROTECTION OF TREES
Section 7-36 Purpose, Intent and Scope of Article
(a) The Board finds that:
(1) Trees are proven producers of oxygen, a necessary element for the survival
of men and women;
(2) Trees appreciably reduce the ever-increasing environmentally dangerous
carbon dioxide content of the air and play a vital role in purifying the air that
we breathe;
(3) Trees precipitate dust and other particulate air-borne pollutants from the air
and create temporary conditions of narcosis allowing air-borne pollutants to
settle to the ground;
(4) Trees transpire considerable amounts of water each day and thereby purify
the air much like the air-washer devices used on commercial air conditioning
systems;
(5) Trees have an important role in neutralizing waste water passing through the
ground from the surface to ground water tables and lower aquifers;
(6) Trees through their root systems stabilize the ground water tables and play
an important effective part in community-wide soil conservation, erosion
control and flood control;
(7) Trees are an invaluable physical, aesthetic and psychological counter point to
the urban setting, making urban life more comfortable by providing shade
and cooling the air and land, reducing noise levels and glare, and breaking
the monotony of human developments on the land; and
(8) The need for trees is particularly acute and trees are especially valuable
along public rights-of-way and other town-owned property.
(b) Based upon the findings set forth in subsection (a), the board declares that it is not
only desirable but essential to the health, safety and welfare of all the citizens of the Town of
Carrboro, present and future, to protect present trees and to encourage the propagation of trees along
the public rights-of-way and other town-owned property, and the provisions of this article are
designed to accomplish this objective.
7-5
(c) The provisions of this article apply to all areas within 30 feet of the center line of a
public street, or to the right-of-way line, whichever embraces more area, as well as all other townowned
property. For purposes of this article, these areas shall be referred to collectively as "public
property."
Section 7-37 Tree Board
(a) The Carrboro Appearance Commission shall henceforth also act and function as the
Carrboro Tree Board.
(b) The Tree Board shall be empowered to:
(1) Develop and administer a comprehensive tree program;
(2) Recommend needed ordinances to properly regulate tree planting,
maintenance and removal;
(3) Develop and prepare a long-range management plan that deals with existing
and planned or proposed trees and shrubs on public property (master street
tree plan) to be adopted by the board of aldermen;
(4) Develop and implement annual work plans (annual street tree plan) to be
adopted by the board of aldermen; and
(5) Designate one of its members to advise and assist the administrator in
implementing this article
Section 7-38 Permits
(a) No person, without a written permit issued by the administrator, may plant, cut
down, remove, destroy, severely prune (including the root system) or treat with a view to its
preservation from disease or insects, any tree or shrub on public property.
(b) No person, without a written permit issued by the administrator, may place or
maintain upon the ground on public property any stone, cement or other impervious matter or
substance in such a manner as to obstruct the free access of air and water to the roots of any tree or
shrub in such place.
(c) The administrator shall issue the permit required by subsections (a) or (b) within 10
days of a request for such permit unless he/she finds that:
(1) With respect to the planting of a tree or shrub, the proposed planting is
inconsistent with the master street tree plan or the annual street tree plan;
7-6
(2) With respect to the proposed treatment of a tree or shrub, the proposed
treatment poses a danger to other trees or shrubs on public property or a
danger to the public health or safety;
(3) With respect to the cutting down or removal of trees or shrubs, such actions
would be inconsistent with the master street tree plan or the annual street
tree plan and other means are reasonably available to achieve the
legitimate objectives sought to be accomplished by the removal of such trees
or shrubs.
(4) With resect to the placement of stone, cement or other impervious matter
around trees or shrubs, such actions would be inconsistent with the master
street tree plan or the annual street tree plan by posing a substantial danger to
existing or proposed trees or shrubs, and other means that are reasonably
available to achieve the legitimate sought to be accomplished by such
actions.
Section 7-39 Additional Measures to Protect Trees and Shrubs
(a) It shall be the responsibility of the person in charge of the erection, repair, alteration
or removal of any building or structure to place a guard around any tree on public property so as to
prevent injury to such tree. As provided in Section 7-38, if such severe pruning or removal of any
tree is necessary, a written permit shall be obtained.
(b) No person may attach any rope or wire to any tree or shrub or to the guard or stake
intended for the protection of such tree or shrub on public property, except for the purpose of
protecting such tree or shrub or the public.
(c) Trees or shrubs that are diseased or that have an infectious condition that endanger
other trees or shrubs on public property or that otherwise pose a danger to the public health or safety
shall be removed by the owners of the property on which such trees are located within 10 days after
being notified by the administrator of such condition. Such trees are declared to be a public
nuisance, and if not corrected by the responsible person within the time specified herein, the town
may summarily abate any such nuisance that is located on town property on a public right-of-way.
(d) Any person aggrieved may appeal any decision of the administrator to the board of
adjustment in accordance with the procedures specified for appeals set forth in Chapter 15 of the
Town Code.

Article I
DEFINITIONS
Section 8-1 Definitions.
For the purposes of this chapter, unless otherwise specifically provided or unless clearly
required by the context, the following words or phrases shall have the meanings respectively
ascribed to them by this section:
Agent means the person having authority to represent a manufacturer, producer or
distributor of goods or services.
Business means any trade, occupation, profession or other activity engaged in by any
person or entity or caused to be engaged in by any person or entity for gain, profit, benefit or
advantage, direct or indirect, except that such term does not include occasional or isolated sales
or transactions by a person or entity who does not hold himself out as engaged in a business.
1) A person “conducts a business” when he engages in one act of any business. If a
person or entity is (i) listed in the yellow pages of the telephone directory issued
by a telephone system serving the town, or (ii) listed on the internet or other
forms of electronic media, as a business , or (iii) has taxable business valuation
property listed in Orange County, that shall be prima facie evidence that the
person is conducting a business.
2) A person or entity conducts a business “within the town” when he maintains a
business location within the town or when, either personally or through agents, he
(i) solicits business within the town, or (ii) picks up or delivers goods or services
within the town.
Electronic gaming operation means any business enterprise, whether as a principal or
accessory use, where persons utilize electronic machines, including but not limited to computers
and gaming terminals (collectively the “machines”), to conduct games of chance, including
sweepstakes, and where cash, merchandise or other items of value are redeemed or otherwise

Section 8-2 Construction of this Chapter.
This chapter is enacted primarily for revenue purposes, and therefore it should be
construed to require payment of the maximum tax permitted by its terms. A secondary purpose
of this subchapter is to prevent the operation of covered businesses until the person or entity
applying for the license has complied with certain town ordinances. Issuance of a license
pursuant to this subchapter does not excuse the licensee from compliance with any other
ordinance or statute. This chapter does not prevent the town from increasing or decreasing the
amount of any license tax or regulating any business taxed.
8-6
Article II
LEVY OF TAX
Section 8-3 License and Payment of Tax Required.
Subject to Section 8-4, no person or entity may conduct any business within the town
until it has paid the tax required by this chapter and been issued a valid privilege license
pursuant to this chapter. Privilege licenses shall be renewed, and privilege license tax shall be
paid, annually in accordance with this Subchapter I.
Section 8-4 Exemptions.
(a) If an individual conducts a business as a partner in a partnership or as an officer or
employee of a corporation or as an employee or member of any other business
entity, that individual is not required to obtain a privilege license or pay a
privilege license tax. However, the partnership, corporation, or other business
entity must obtain the license and pay the tax unless exempted by this section.
(b) Owners of real property who lease that property need not obtain a privilege
license or pay a privilege license tax solely for acting as lessor of that property.
(c) A person who operates a business as a not-for-profit religious, educational, civic,
patriotic, charitable, or fraternal organization, registered with the State of North
Carolina is exempt from obtaining a privilege license and from paying a
privilege license tax.
(d) Blind persons and persons who serve in the United States Armed Forces or the
Merchant Marines are exempt from obtaining a privilege license and from paying
any privilege license tax levied by this chapter to the extent formerly provided by
G.S. 105-249 and G.S. 105-249.1. (since repealed).
(e) Persons or entities who pick up or deliver goods within the town are not required
to obtain a privilege license or pay a privilege license tax based solely on the pick
up or delivery of goods as part of a transaction for the purchase and sale of such
goods, where the purchaser and/or seller of such goods has a valid privilege
license. (For example, a soft drink distributor not located in Carrboro may deliver
a truck load of soft drinks to a grocery store in Carrboro without becoming liable
to pay a privilege license tax or to obtain a privilege license because the grocery
store in Carrboro does possess a privilege license and pays a privilege license
tax.) Provided, however, that local courier services or delivery services who pick
up and deliver goods for compensation, with a principal place of business within
Carrboro’s corporate limits shall be required to comply with the requirements of
this Subchapter I.
8-7
(f) The businesses listed on Schedule A annexed hereto and incorporated in this
Ordinance by reference (the Schedule of Exempt Businesses) are exempt by State
law from obtaining a privilege license or paying a privilege license tax as
provided by the indicated section of the General Statutes.
(g) Any business whose sole business activity within Carrboro’s corporate limits is
the sale or provision of goods or services at events conducted on Town-owned
property shall be exempt from the requirements of this Subchapter I. Provided,
however, that if such business conducts any other business within Carrboro’s
corporate limits it shall be subject to this Subchapter I with respect to revenues
generated by such other business.
Section 8-5 License Tax Schedule.
(a) (i) Subject to the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this section, all
persons and entities conducting nonexempt business within the town shall pay a privilege license
tax in an amount based upon the annual gross receipts of that business during the previous year.
The privilege license tax schedule shall be included in the town Miscellaneous Fees and Charges
Schedule and may be amended periodically by resolution of the Board of Aldermen, provided
that amendments to the privilege license tax schedule shall become effective beginning the first
fiscal year that occurs more than two months after the changes are adopted. (Amended. 6/5/07,
6/22/2010)
(2) If the business has been in operation for a period of least three months, but
less than one year, on the date the privilege license application is due, then
the amount of the tax shall be calculated by (i) estimating the annual gross
receipts by dividing the actual gross receipts for the number of whole
months the business has been in operation by that number of months, and
multiplying that result by twelve, and (ii) determining the tax by using the
estimated gross receipts in reference to the table set forth in subsection
(a)1) above. (For example, if a business commences operation in on
March 1st and generates $20,000 in gross receipts by June 30, the privilege
license tax due would be calculated as follows: $20,000 divided by 4
months (March, April, May, June) equals $5,000, times 12 equals
$60,000; estimated gross receipts for privilege license tax purposes is
$60,000).
(3) If the business has not been in operation for at least three months on the
date the privilege license application is due, or if the business is conducted
or is intended to be conducted for not more than a total of ten days in any
twelve month period, then the amount of the privilege license tax shall be
$25.00.
(b) The businesses with rates fixed by state statute, incorporated within the Town’s
Miscellaneous Fees and Charges Schedule as “Schedule of Fees For Businesses
Established By State Statute,” shall pay a privilege license tax equal to the
8-8
amount stated in the fee schedule. If substantially all the gross receipts of a
business are derived from a single business activity that is subject to a rate fixed
by the state, then that business shall pay a privilege license tax equal to the
amount listed in the Schedule of Fees for Businesses Established by State Statute
only. If only an insubstantial portion of a business’s gross receipts are derived
from a business activity whose rates are fixed in state statutes, then such business
shall pay a privilege license tax as fixed by state statute plus an amount
determined by application of the schedule established by subparagraph (a) to the
gross receipts of the business minus the portion of its gross receipts derived from
the business activity that is fixed by state statute. The privilege license fees, shall
be maintained on file in the town clerk’s office within the miscellaneous fees and
charges schedules approved annually by the board of aldermen in connection with
the annual budget ordinance
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, all persons and
entities engaged in the business of an electronic gaming operation within the town shall pay an
annual privilege license tax in the amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000) plus five hundred
dollars ($500.00) per electronic gaming machine use or stored as part of the electronic gaming
operation. (Amend. 6/22/2010)

its license to the town manager, together with a written and signed statement as to the nature of

(b) Statement of gross receipts. When the amount of the tax to be paid depends on
gross receipts, applicants for a license shall render to the town manager a sworn statement of the
gross receipts of the business as defined in Section 8-1), and upon an applicant’s failure to render
such a sworn statement, the amount of tax to be paid shall be $200.
(c) Confidentiality. To the extent permitted by law, all information regarding gross
receipts furnished or secured under authority of this ordinance shall be kept in confidence by the
town manager and used solely for the administration of this chapter. Provided that summaries of

budgetary matters.

In addition to the information furnished by applicants on the application form as provided
in section 8-10, every solicitor subject to the provisions of Article VII of this Subchapter I, who

8-11
2) The applicant refuses to provide information necessary to compute the
amount of tax due.

to conducting business when required to do so by local ordinance.
4) The administrator charged with the enforcement of the following
codes or ordinances has certified to the town manager that the
applicant has been found to be in violation of the law enforced by the
administrator and has either failed to appeal that determination within
the time provided or has exhausted all administrative and judicial
appeals: North Carolina State Building Code, Zoning Ordinance,
Subdivision Ordinance, Chapter 11 or 12 of the Town Code.
Section 8-14 Unqualified Applicants; Right to a Conference.
(a) If, after receipt of the completed application, the town manager believes that a
reason exists to deny a license under Section 8-13, he shall refuse to accept payment of the tax
and shall not issue the license. At the applicant’s request, the town manager shall, pursuant to
Section 8-22, give the applicant a written statement of the reasons for refusing the license. The
applicant may, within ten days after receipt of such statement, request a conference to discuss the
denial. Such request shall specify why the application should not have been denied. The town

the applicant of that amount. The town manager shall not issue a license until the tax is paid.
Section 8-16 Amount of Tax Disputed.
If the applicant disputes the amount of tax the town manager determines to be due, he
may either refuse to pay the tax and request a conference with the town manager to discuss the
determination, or pay the amount and request a conference to discuss his right for a refund. If a
conference is requested, the town manager shall arrange it in a reasonable time, not to exceed
thirty days after receipt of the request for a conference. However, if the applicant refuses to pay
the tax in the amount calculated by the town manager, no license shall be issued and the
applicant shall not conduct business within Carrboro’s corporate limits until the proper tax is
8-12
paid.
Section 8-17 Revocation.
(a) The town manager shall revoke a license if reason exists to revoke it as set forth
in Section 8-13. The town manager may also revoke a license to operate a motor vehicle towing
business within the town if the manager concludes that the licensee has violated the provisions of
Article IX of this chapter. Before the town manager may revoke a license, he shall give the
licensee ten (10) days advance written notice of the grounds for revocation, pursuant to Section 8
-22. The licensee may, within ten days after the day on which the notice is served, request in
writing a conference with the town manager. The request shall specify the reasons why the
license should not be revoked. The town manager shall arrange the conference within a
reasonable time, not to exceed thirty days. The licensee may continue to operate its business
until the conference is conducted. (Amend. 10/4/11)

the town manager may not revoke the license until after the conference.
(c) If the town manager revokes a license, the former licensee may apply for a new
license at any time thereafter. If the reason for which the license was revoked no longer exists,
and if no other reason exists to deny a license, the town manager shall issue the license pursuant
to Section 8-15; provided that, if a licensee has violated the provisions of Article IX of this
chapter, a new or renewal license may not be issued for a period of three months after the

Regulation of Smoking

cancer, in healthy nonsmokers. At special risk are children, elderly people,
individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and
those with obstructive airway disease.

CHAPTER 8A
HOTEL AND MOTEL ROOM OCCUPANCY TAX
Section 8A-1. Tax Levied.
There is hereby levied a room occupancy tax of three percent (3%) of the gross receipts derived
from the rental of any room, lodging, or accommodation furnished by a hotel, motel, inn, tourist camp,
or similar place within the town that is subject to sales tax imposed by the State under G.S. 105-
164.4(a)(3). This tax is in addition to any State or local sales tax. This tax does not apply to
accommodations furnished by nonprofit charitable, educational, or religious organizations when
furnished in furtherance of their nonprofit purpose.
Section 8A-2. Payment of Tax.
(a) As provided in G.S. 160A-215(c), a retailer who is required to remit to the Department of
Revenue the State sales tax imposed by G.S. 105-164.4(a)(3) on accommodations is required to remit a
room occupancy tax to the town on and after the effective date of this Chapter. The room occupancy
tax applies to the same gross receipts as the State sales tax on accommodations and is calculated in the
same manner as that tax. A rental agent or a facilitator, as defined in G.S. 105-164.4(a)(3), has the same
responsibility and liability under the room occupancy tax as the rental agent or facilitator has under the
State sales tax on accommodations.
(b) If a taxable accommodation is furnished as part of a package, the bundled transaction
provisions in G.S. 106-164.4D apply in determining the sales price of the taxable accommodation. If
those provisions do not address the type of package offered,, the person offering the package may
determine an allocated price for each item in the package based on a reasonable allocation of revenue
that is supported by the person’s business records kept in the ordinary course of business and calculate
tax on the allocated price of the taxable accommodation.
(c) A retailer must separately state the room occupancy tax. Room occupancy taxes paid to a
retailer are held in trust for and on account of the town.
(d) The town shall design and furnish to all appropriate businesses and persons in the town the
necessary forms for filing returns and instructions to ensure the full collection of the tax. An operator of
a business who collects a room occupancy tax may deduct from the amount remitted to the town a
discount equal to the discount the State allows the retailer for State sales and use tax.
(e) As provided in G.S. 160A-215(d), the tax levied by this Chapter shall be due and payable to
the town finance officer in monthly installments on or before the 20th day of the month following the
month in which the tax accrues. Every person, firm, corporation, or association liable for the tax shall,
on or before the 20th day of each month, prepare and render a return on a form prescribed by the town.
The return shall state the total gross receipts derived in the preceding month from rentals upon which the
tax is levied. A room occupancy tax return filed with the town is not a public record and may not be
disclosed except in accordance with G.S. 160A-208.1.
Section 8A-3. Penalties.
As provided in G.S. 160A-215(e), a person, firm, corporation, or association who fails or refuses
to file a room occupancy tax return or pay a room occupancy tax as required by this Chapter shall be
subject to the civil and criminal penalties set by G.S. 105-236 for failure to pay or file a return for State
sales and use taxes. The Board of Aldermen has the same authority to waive the penalties for a room
occupancy tax that the Secretary of Revenue has to waive the penalties for State sales and use taxes.
Section 8A-4. Distribution and Use of Tax Revenue.
The town shall, on a quarterly basis, remit the net proceeds of the occupancy tax to the Carrboro
Tourism Development Authority (CTDA). The CTDA shall use at least two-thirds of the funds remitted
to it under this section to promote travel and tourism in Carrboro and shall use the remainder for
tourism-related expenditures. The following definitions apply in this section:
(1) Net Proceeds. Gross proceeds less the cost to the town of administering and
collecting the tax, as determined by the finance officer, not to exceed three
percent (3%) of the first five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) of gross

collected each year.
(2) Promote travel and tourism. To advertise or market an area or activity, publish
and distribute pamphlets and other materials, conduct market research, or engage
in similar promotional activities that attract tourists or business travelers to the
area. The term includes administrative expenses incurred in engaging in these
activities.
(3) Tourism-related expenditures. Expenditures that, in the judgment of the
CTDA, are designed to increase the use of lodging facilities, meeting facilities,
and convention facilities in the town by attracting tourists or business travelers to
the town. The term includes tourism-related capital expenditures.
Section 8A-5. Carrboro Tourism Development Authority: Appointment and Membership.
(a) The Carrboro Tourism Development Authority (CTDA) is hereby created, which shall be a
public authority under the Local Government Budget and Fiscal Control Act.
(b) The CTDA shall consist of three members appointed by the Board of Aldermen. Members
need not reside within the town, but at one member must be affiliated with businesses that collect the tax
in the town and two members must be currently active in the promotion of travel and tourism in the
town. (Amend. 9-10-19)
(c) Subject to subsection (d), members shall be appointed for terms of one year. The initial
terms of all appointees shall expire on January 31 of the year that follows the initial appointments.
Subsequent terms shall run from February 1 of one year to January 31 of the following year. Vacancies
shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term. Members may be appointed to successive terms
without limitation.

Board at any time with or without cause.

quorum shall consist of two members. All actions of the CTDA shall be taken by majority vote, a
quorum being present.
(c) Upon the initial appointment of members to the CTDA and upon the commencement of each
new term, the Board of Aldermen shall appoint one member to serve as chair of the CTDA during that
term. If a vacancy occurs during a term, the Board shall designate another member to serve as chair for
the remainder of that term. The chair may take part in all deliberations and vote on all issues.

may require.

abandoned the intent and purpose to repair, alter, or improve the building or structure and
that the continuation of the building or structure in its vacated and closed status would be
inimical to the health, safety, and welfare of the Town in that it would continue to
deteriorate, would create a fire or safety hazard, would be a threat to children and vagrants,
would attract persons intent on criminal activities, or would cause or contribute to blight and
the deterioration of property values in the area, then the Board of Aldermen may, after the
expiration of the two-year period, adopt an ordinance and serve such ordinance on the
owner, setting forth the following:

current license plates and a current inspection sticker unless a permit has been issued for such

that the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the vehicle is operable or can be made operable
within a period of one year, the applicant may appeal this determination to the board of adjustment.
The board shall hear and decide this appeal in the same manner as an appeal of a decision of the

(42 U.S.C. § 3602), or are “handicapped” as that term is defined in N.C.G.S. § 168-21.
(AMENDED 6/22/05)
(4) ADULT CARE HOME, CLASS B. A group home for adults that serves primarily the needs of
those who (i) are “dangerous to others” as those terms are defined in N.C.G.S. 122C-3(11)

the building or at the teller machine, and teller machines that are totally separate from bank
buildings and therefore generate additional traffic. (AMENDED 09/01/92)

more than two rooms that are rented out or are designed or intended to be rented but which
rooms, individually or collectively, do not constitute separate dwelling units. A rooming
house or boarding house is distinguished from a tourist home in that the former is designed
to be occupied by longer term residents (at least month-to-month tenants) as opposed to
overnight or weekly guests.
(12) BUILDING. A structure designed to be used as a place of occupancy, storage or shelter.
(13) BUILDING, ACCESSORY. A minor building that is located on the same lot as a principal

separately operated enterprises occupy the same lot, and all such enterprises fall within the
same principal use classification, this shall not constitute a combination use.)

into any permit issued in reliance thereon, and except as otherwise provided in Section 15-64, all
development shall occur strictly in accordance with such approved plans. (AMENDED 1/10/81)
(c) Physical improvements to land to be subdivided may not be commenced except in
accordance with a conditional use permit issued by the Board of Aldermen (for major subdivisions
containing more than twelve lots and all subdivisions in watershed districts) or a special use permit

B-1(c), B-1(g) or B-2 zoning district if such alteration does not change the exterior of such building
or structure in any substantial way. (AMENDED 10/22/91)
Section 15-47 No Occupancy, Use, or Sale of Lots Until Requirements Fulfilled.
Issuance of a conditional use, special use, or zoning permit authorizes the recipient to
commence the activity resulting in a change in use of the land or, (subject to obtaining a building
permit), to commence work designed to construct, erect, move, or substantially alter buildings or
other substantial structures or to make necessary improvements to a subdivision. However, except
as provided in Sections 15-53, 15-60, and 15-61, the intended use may not be commenced, no
building may be occupied, and in the case of subdivisions, no lots may be sold until all of the
requirements of this chapter and all additional requirements imposed pursuant to the issuance of a
zoning permit, conditional use, or special use permit have been complied with.
Section 15-48 Who May Submit Permit Applications.
(a) Applications for zoning, special use, conditional use, or sign permits or minor
subdivision plat approval will be accepted only from persons having the legal authority to take
action in accordance with the permit or the minor subdivision plat approval. By way of illustration,
in general this means that applications should be made by the owners or lessees of property, or their
agents, or persons who have contracted to purchase property contingent upon their ability to acquire
the necessary permits under this chapter, or the agents of such persons (who may make application
in the name of such owners, lessees, or contract venders).
(b) The administrator may require an applicant to submit evidence of his authority to
submit the application in accordance with subsection (a) whenever there appears to be a reasonable
basis for questioning this authority.
Section 15-48.1 Concept Plan Review Procedures Prior to Submitting Applications
(Amended 10/24/06).
(a) Prior to submitting an application for a special or conditional use permit or for conditional
zoning to allow use classification 3.260 Social Service Provider/Community Kitchen, the
applicant shall comply with the requirements of this section. (AMENDED 03/22/16)
(b) The applicant shall attend a regularly scheduled Development Review meeting and discuss
the proposed project with staff in attendance at such meeting. This requirement shall not
apply to a developer of a proposed major subdivision who has met with the planning staff under
the provisions of Subsection 15-50(d) following an “on-site walkabout”.
(c) Following compliance with the provisions of subsection (b), the applicant shall attend a
Joint Advisory Board meeting comprising at least the following boards: Planning Board,
Appearance Commission, Transportation Advisory Board, Environmental Advisory Board, and
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 3
Economic Sustainability Commission. The planning staff may notify the Recreation and Parks
Commission, Northern Transition Area Advisory Committee and Affordable Housing Advisory
Commission when issues relevant to those boards are raised by a proposed development and
members of those boards may attend. (AMENDED 06/25/19)
(1) No quorum requirements shall apply to the Joint Advisory Board.
(2) The applicant shall present to the Joint Advisory Board sufficient information about
the proposed development to enable the board to have a general understanding of the
nature and extent of the development. If the development is a major subdivision,
then a “conceptual preliminary plan” prepared in accordance with the provisions of
Section 15-50 shall suffice. If the development is not a major subdivision, then the
information submitted shall include at least the following:
a. A sketch site plan showing the location and size (including floor area) of proposed
buildings, (including the extent to which buildings taller than 40 feet
may cast a shadow), parking areas, and driveway entrances; (AMENDED
03/25/14)
b. Proposed residential densities and types of residential units (in terms of number
of bedrooms);
c. Illustrations of building elevations.
d. Other information deemed necessary by the staff to demonstrate to the Joint
Advisory Board the concept of the proposed development.
(d) Following the presentation of the concept plan to the Joint Advisory Board, the members
of that board may present such feedback to the developer as they deem appropriate. In addition,
following the Joint Advisory Board meeting, the component advisory boards may meet separately
and make recommendations to the developer.
(e) When the development application comes back before the advisory boards for a recommendation
prior to the public hearing on such application, the applicant shall provide a written
response to all advisory board comments, and each advisory board that has reviewed the concept
plan and made comments on it shall review those comments and may ask the developer to
explain how those comments have been addressed or why they have not been addressed.
Section 15-49 Applications To Be Complete.
(a) All applications for zoning, special use, conditional use, or sign permits must be
complete before the permit-issuing authority is required to consider the application.
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 4
(b) Subject to subsections (c) and (c1), an application is complete when it contains all of
the information that is necessary for the permit-issuing authority to decide whether or not the
development, if completed as proposed, will comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
(AMENDED 11/23/10).
(c) In this chapter, detailed or technical design requirements and construction
specifications relating to various types of improvements (streets, sidewalks, etc.) are set forth in
one or more of the appendices of this chapter. It is not necessary that the application contain the
type of detailed construction drawings that would be necessary to determine compliance with
these appendices, so long as (subject to subsection (c1)) the plans provide sufficient information
to allow the permit-issuing authority to evaluate the application in the light of the substantive
requirements set forth in this text of this chapter. However, whenever this chapter requires a
certain element of a development to be constructed in accordance with the detailed requirements
set forth in one or more of these appendices, or whenever it reasonably appears to the
administrator that such construction drawings are necessary to demonstrate that construction
details will comply with plans submitted and approved as part of the permit-issuing process, then
no construction work on such element may be commenced until detailed construction drawings
have been submitted to and approved by the administrator. A detailed description of the
construction plan submittal and review requirements is provided in Article IV, Part III. Failure to
observe this requirement may result in permit revocation, denial of final subdivision plat
approval, or other penalty as provided in Article VII. (AMENDED 06/06/89; 11/23/10)
(c1) If the administrator determines that a proposed development that has been issued a
zoning permit, special use permit, or conditional use permit would likely have a significant impact
on adjoining or nearby streets, sidewalks, or properties during the construction process, the
administrator shall notify the permit recipient that a construction management plan must be
submitted and approved by the administrator. Examples of significant impacts include but are
not limited to the construction of more than 1000 square feet of new building area in the
downtown commercial zoning districts or ground disturbance of more than 20,000 square feet
in the downtown commercial zoning districts. A construction management plan shall likewise
be submitted and approved by the administrator if required by a condition attached to a
conditional or special use permit. (AMENDED 02/25/14)
(1) The administrator shall inform the permit recipient of the contents
of the Town Code regarding (i) construction noise and hours of operation (Section
5-12(4)), and (ii) obstructing or excavating within public street rights of way (Sections
7-1, 7-4, and 7-12). The administrator shall also inform the developer that
the construction management plan shall commit the developer to compliance with
those provisions and shallexplain how the developer intends to address other potential
impacts identified by the administrator, such as streets to be used or avoided
by construction vehicles, the location of entrances to the site for construction
vehicles, parking for employees, contractors and subcontractors, and the location
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 5
on the site for the staging of construction materials and equipment, and concerns
about potentially harmful pollutants including by not limited to dust, debris and
aerosols.
(2) If a development triggers a construction management plan, a meeting will be held
by the developer with surrounding residents and businesses to elicit their input into
the development of the construction management plan and to ensure its implementation.
Town staff shall be present at the meeting and shall record the minutes
to make certain that public input is conveyed to the applicant and incorporated into
the construction management plan.
(3) No construction may be commenced until the construction management plan has
been approved. The administrator shall approve the plan if the plan proposes
measures to mitigate the potential negative impacts of the project during the construction
process to the extent reasonably practical under all the circumstances.
(4) The provisions of an approved construction management plan shall be enforceable
in the same manner as other provisions of this chapter. (AMENDED 02/25/14)
(c2) Permit applications for commercial projects (meaning those where at least twenty
percent of the proposed floor area is devoted to non-residential uses) in the commercial zoning
districts need not contain all of the detailed information necessary for the permit issuing authority
to determine that the development, if constructed in accordance with the application and plans,
will comply with the drainage and stormwater management requirements set forth in Sections 15-
262 and 15-263 of this chapter, so long as:
(1) The application contains sufficient information to explain how the development
will address drainage and stormwater management issues, and it
appears reasonably likely to the permit issuing authority that the proposed
drainage and stormwater management systems will function in such a
manner that the development will comply with Sections 15-262 and 15-
263; and
(2) Before construction plans are approved, such plans must demonstrate that
all the requirements of Sections 15-262 and 15-263 and related appendices
will be satisfied. (AMENDED 11/23/10, 02/25/14)
(d) The presumption established by this chapter is that all of the information set forth in
Appendix A is necessary to satisfy the requirements of this section. However, it is recognized that
each development is unique, and therefore the permit-issuing authority may allow less information
or require more information to be submitted according to the needs of the particular case. For
applications submitted to the Board of Aldermen or board of adjustment, the applicant may rely in
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 6
the first instance on the recommendations of the administrator as to whether more or less
information than that set forth in Appendix A should be submitted.
(e) The administrator shall make every effort to develop application forms, instructional
sheets, checklists, or other techniques or devices to assist applicants in understanding the
application requirements and the form and type of information that must be submitted. In classes of
cases where a minimal amount of information is necessary to enable the administrator to determine
compliance with this chapter, such as applications for zoning permits to construct single-family
houses or duplexes, or applications for sign permits, the administrator shall develop standard forms
that will expedite the submission of the necessary plans and other required information.
Section 15-50 Site Planning Procedures for Major Subdivisions (AMENDED 05/25/99).
(a) Before submitting an application for a conditional or special use permit for a major
subdivision, the applicant shall comply with the requirements of this section.
(b) The applicant shall submit a site analysis plan drawn approximately to scale (1inch
= 100 feet) that contains the following information:
(1) The name and address of the developer;
(2) The proposed name and location of the subdivision
(3) The approximate total acreage of the proposed subdivision;
(4) Topographic lines based on maps published by the U.S. Geological Survey;
and
(5) The location of all primary and secondary conservation areas as defined in
subsections 15-198(b)(4) and (5).
(6) The location of any existing or proposed road connections on adjacent
property.
(c) After the site analysis plan has been submitted, the planning staff shall schedule a
mutually convenient date to walk the property with the applicant and the applicant’s site
designer. Designated members of the Planning Board, Northern Transition Advisory Committee,
Transportation Advisory Board, Environmental Advisory Board, Appearance Commission, and
Affordable Housing Advisory Commission shall be notified of the date and time of this “on-site
walkabout.” The purpose of this visit is to familiarize town officials with the property’s special
features and to provide an informal opportunity for an interchange of information as to the
developer’s plans and the town’s requirements. (REWRITTEN 02/25/14) (AMENDED
06/25/2019).
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL

(d) Prior to the submission of a conceptual preliminary plan as described in subsection
(e), the staff shall meet with the developer to discuss how the four-step approach to designing
subdivisions described below could be applied to the subject property. This conference may be
combined with the on-site walkabout.
(e) Following completion of the steps described in subsections (b), (c), and (d), the
developer shall submit a conceptual preliminary plan of the proposed subdivision, prepared in
accordance with the four-step process described in subsection (f). This plan shall be a preliminarily
engineered sketch plan drawn to illustrate initial thoughts about a conceptual layout for open space,
house sites, and street alignments. This is the stage where drawings are tentatively illustrated,
before heavy engineering costs are incurred in the design of any proposed subdivision layout. The
planning staff shall review this plan and provide comment to the developer on the overall pattern of
streets, houselots, open space, and the treatment of primary and secondary conservation areas in
light of the applicable requirements of this chapter.
(f) Each conceptual preliminary plan shall be prepared using the following four-step
design process:
(1) During the first step, all primary and secondary conservation areas are
identified (and shown on the site analysis plan described in subsection (b)).
(2) During the second step, potential sites are tentatively located. House sites
should generally be located not closer than 100 feet from primary
conservation areas and 50 feet from secondary conservation areas.
(3) The third step consists of aligning proposed streets to provide vehicular
access to each house in the most reasonable and economical way and to
identify points of existing or proposed connectivity in order to comply with
Subsection 15-217(a). When lots and access streets are laid out, they shall be
located in a way that avoids or at least minimizes adverse impacts on
primary and secondary conservation areas. To the greatest extent
practicable, wetland crossings and streets traversing existing slopes over
15% shall be strongly discouraged. Street connections shall comply with the
provisions of Section 15-214.
(4) The fourth step is to draw in the lot lines.
(g) The conceptual preliminary plan shall demonstrate that the proposed development
will satisfy the following objectives, as more particularly described in the remaining provisions of
this chapter:
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 8
(1) Protects and preserves all floodplains, wetlands, and steep slopes from
clearing, grading, filling, or construction (except as may be approved by
the Town for essential infrastructure or active or passive recreation amenities).
(2) Preserves and maintains mature woodlands, existing fields, pastures,
meadows, and orchards, and creates sufficient buffer areas to minimize
conflicts between residential and agricultural uses. For example, locating
houselots and driveways within wooded areas is generally recommended,
with two exceptions. The first involves significant wildlife habitat or mature
woodlands which raise an equal or greater preservation concern, ad
described in #5 and #8 below. The second involves predominantly
agricultural areas, where remnant tree groups provide the only natural areas
for wildlife habitat.
(3) If development must be located on open fields or pastures because of greater
constraints in all other parts of the site, dwellings should be sited on the least
prime agricultural soils, or in locations at the far edge of a field, as seen from
existing public roads. Other considerations include whether the
development will be visually buffered from existing public roads, such as by
a planting screen consisting of a variety of indigenous native trees, shrubs
and wildflowers (specifications for which should be based upon a close
examination of the distribution and frequency of those species, found in a
typical nearby roadside verge or hedgerow).
(4) Maintains or creates an upland buffer of natural native species vegetation of
at least 100 feet in depth adjacent to wetlands and surface waters, including
creeks, streams, springs, lakes and ponds.
(5) Designs around existing hedgerows and treelines between fields or
meadows. Minimizes impacts on large woodlands (greater than five acres),
especially those containing many mature trees or a significant wildlife
habitat, or those not degraded by invasive vines. Also, woodlands of any
size on highly erodible soils with slopes greater than 10 percent should be
avoided. However, woodlands in poor condition with limited management
potential can provide suitable location for residential development. When
any woodland is developed, great care shall be taken to design all disturbed
areas (for buildings, roads, yards, septic disposal field, etc) in locations
where there are no large trees or obvious wildlife areas, to the fullest extent
that is practicable.
(6) Leaves scenic views and vistas unblocked or uninterrupted, particularly as
seen from public roadways. (For example, in open agrarian landscapes, a
deep, “no-build, no-plant” buffer is recommended along the public roadway
where those views or vistas are prominent or locally significant. In wooded
areas where the sense of enclosure is a feature that should be maintained, a
deep “no-build, no-cut” buffer should be respected, to preserve existing
vegetation.
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 9
(7) Avoids siting new construction on prominent hilltops or ridges, by taking
advantage of lower topographic features.
(8) Protects wildlife habitat areas of special species listed as endangered,
threatened, or of special concern by the state or federal government.
(9) Designs around and preserves sites of historic, archaeological, or cultural
value, and their environs, insofar as needed to safeguard the character of the
feature, including stone walls, spring houses, barn foundations, cellar holes,
earthworks, burial grounds, etc.
(10) Protects rural roadside character and improves public safety and vehicular
carrying capacity by avoiding development fronting onto existing public
roads. Establishes buffer zones along the scenic corridor of rural roads with
historic buildings, stone walls, hedgerows, etc.
(11) Landscapes common areas (such as community greens), and both sides of
new streets with native specie shade trees and flowering shrubs with high
wildlife conservation value.
(12) Provides active recreational areas in suitable locations offering convenient
access by residents, and adequately screened from nearby houselots.
(13) Includes a pedestrian circulation system designed to assure that pedestrians
can walk safely and easily on the site, between properties and activities or
special features within the neighborhood open space system. All roadside
footpaths should connect with off-road trails, which in turn should link with
potential open space on adjoining undeveloped parcels (or with existing
open space on adjoining developed parcels, where applicable).
(14) Provides open space that is reasonably contiguous, and whose configuration
is in accordance with the guidelines contained in the Design and
Management Handbook for Preservation Areas, produced by the Natural
Lands Trust. For example, fragmentation of open space should be
minimized so that these resource areas are not divided into numerous small
parcels located in various parts of the development. To the greatest extent
practicable, this land shall be designed as a single block with logical,
straightforward boundaries. Long thin strips of conservation land shall be
avoided, unless the conservation feature is linear or unless such
configuration is necessary to connect with other streams or trails. The open
space shall generally abut existing or potential open space land on adjacent
parcels, and shall be designed as part of larger, contiguous, and integrated
greenway systems, as per the policies in the Open Space and Recreation
section of the Town’s Ordinance.
Section 15-51 Staff Consultation After Application Submitted.
(a) Upon receipt of a formal application for a zoning, special use, or conditional use
permit, or minor plat approval, the administrator shall review the application and confer with the
applicant to ensure that he understands the planning staff’s interpretation of the applicable
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 10
requirements of this chapter, that he has submitted all of the information that he intends to submit,
and that the application represents precisely and completely what he proposes to do.
(b) If the application is for a special use or conditional use permit, the administrator
shall place the application on the agenda of the appropriate boards when the applicant indicates that
the application is as complete as he intends to make it. However, as provided in Sections 15-56 and
15-57, if the administrator believes that the application is incomplete, he shall recommend to the
appropriate boards that the application be denied on that basis.
Section 15-52 Zoning Permits.
(a) A completed application form for a zoning permit shall be submitted to the
administrator by filing a copy of the application with the administrator in the planning department.
(b) The administrator shall issue the zoning permit unless he finds, after reviewing the
application and consulting with the applicant as provided in Section 15-50, that:
(1) The requested permit is not within his jurisdiction according to the Table of
Permissible Uses as interpreted in the light of the other provisions of Article
X, particularly Section 148.
(2) The application is incomplete; or
(3) If completed as proposed in the application, the development will not
comply with one or more requirements of this chapter (not including those
requirements concerning which a variance has been granted or those the
applicant is not required to comply with under the circumstances specified in
Article VIII, Nonconforming Situations).
(c) If the administrator determines that the development for which a zoning permit is
requested will have or may have substantial impact on surrounding properties, he or she shall, at
least ten days before taking final action on the permit request, send a written notice to those persons
who have listed for taxation real property any portion of which is within 150 feet of the lot that is
the subject of the application, informing them that: (AMENDED 5/26/81)
(1) An application has been filed for a permit authorizing identified property to
be used in a specified way;
(2) All persons wishing to comment on the application should contact the
administrator by a certain date; and
(3) Persons wishing to be informed of the outcome of the application should
send a written request for such notification to the administrator.
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 11
(d) In determining under subsection © whether a development for which a zoning
permit is requested “will have or may have [a] substantial impact on surrounding properties” the
administrator shall consider, among other relevant factors, whether: (AMENDED 5/21/02)
(1) The development involves a permit for property where a nonconforming
situation exists: and
(2) The development constitutes a departure from the development pattern of
surrounding properties in terms of the type, density, intensity or scale of use.
(e) If the administrator is contacted by a person entitled to receive notice under
subsection © within the time period specified in subsection ©(2) and requested to delay issuing the
permit for an additional period of not more than ten days, the administrator shall comply with this
request and so notify the permit applicant. (AMENDED 5/21/02).
Section 15-53 Performance Guarantee to Ensure Compliance with Zoning Permit
(AMENDED 10/24/06, 6/22/10).
In cases when, because of weather conditions or other factors beyond the control of the zoning
permit recipient (exclusive of financial hardship), it would be unreasonable to require the zoning
permit recipient to comply with all of the requirements of this chapter (including approved plans)
before commencing the intended use of the property or occupying any buildings, the administrator
may authorize the commencement of the intended use or occupancy of buildings (insofar as
the requirements of this chapter are concerned) if the permit recipient provides a surety bond,
letter of credit or other security satisfactory to the administrator to ensure that all these requirements
will be fulfilled within a reasonable period of time (not to exceed twelve months)
determined by the administrator. The developer shall choose which of the above listed performance
guarantees to use. Upon a showing of good cause, the administrator may approve the
extension of such security for successive periods of up to twelve months each, so long as such
extension does not compromise the health or safety of the general public or the occupants of the
property that is the subject of the permit.
Section 15-54 Special Use Permits and Conditional Use Permits (AMENDED 6/28/05).
(a) An application for a special use permit shall be submitted to the board of adjustment
by filing a copy of the application with the administrator in the planning department.
(b) An application for a conditional use permit shall be submitted to the Board of
Aldermen by filing a copy of the application with the administrator in the planning department.
(c) The board of adjustment or the Board of Aldermen, respectively, shall issue the
requested permit unless it concludes, based upon the information submitted at the hearing, that:
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 12
1) The requested permit is not within its jurisdiction according to the table of
permissible uses;
2) The application is incomplete, or
3) If completed as proposed in the application, the development will not
comply with one or more requirements of this chapter (not including those
the applicant is not required to comply with under the circumstances
specified in Article VIII, Nonconforming Situations);
4) If completed as proposed, the development, more probably than not:
a) Will materially endanger the public health or safety; or
b) Will substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting property;
or
c) Will not be in harmony with the area in which it is to be located; or
d) Will not be in general conformity with the Land Use Plan,
Thoroughfare Plan, or other plans officially adopted by the Board.
Section 15-54.1 Affordable Housing Goal and Alternative Methods of Achieving the Goal
(AMENDED 6/28/05; REWRITTEN 6/26/07; AMENDED 10/28/08); AMENDED 6/26/12.
(a) The Board of Aldermen has established as a policy goal that at least fifteen percent of
the housing units within all new residential developments should consist of affordable housing
units as described in Section 15-182.4. That section, as well as Section 15-188, establish
incentives for developers to provide for such affordable housing. The purpose of this section is
to establish alternative processes whereby developers who do not achieve the 15% objective can
nevertheless contribute to the fulfillment of this goal in another way, and also to create a process
to ensure that developers understand the importance of attempting to meet this goal.
(b) An applicant for approval of any residential development containing five or more
dwelling units or lots that does not elect to meet the Board’s 15% affordable housing policy goal
by constructing affordable housing units or donating affordable housing lots (as those terms are
described in Section 15-182.4) shall nevertheless be considered to have met this goal if such
applicant makes a payment to the Town’s Affordable Housing Special Reserve Fund in lieu of
such construction or donation in an amount calculated as provided in this subsection:
1) The number of dwelling units or lots authorized within the development (including
additional units or lots authorized under Section 15-182.4 when the developer conArt.
IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 13
structs affordable units, provides affordable housing lots, or is authorized by the
Board to construct density bonus units by making a payment in lieu of constructing
units) shall be multiplied by 0.15 and the product shall be carried to two decimal
places. (REWRITTEN 1/22/08)
2) There shall be subtracted from the product derived under subsection (b)(1) of this
section (i) the number of affordable housing units or affordable housing lots the developer
proposes to provide under Section 15-182.4, plus (ii) the number of affordable
housing payment in lieu fees the Board has agreed to allow to be regarded as the
equivalent of providing an affordable housing unit under Subsection 15-
182.4(d1). (REWRITTEN 1/22/08)
3) The product derived under subsection (b)(2) shall be multiplied by the affordable
housing payment in lieu fee. The result is the amount that must be paid to satisfy
the provisions of this subsection (b).
4) The affordable housing payment in lieu fee shall be an amount established by the
Board of Aldermen and shall be included in the Town’s Miscellaneous Fees and
Charges Schedule. In establishing the amount of this fee, the Board may consider
(i) the extent to which the costs incurred by a developer in constructing and selling
a two bedroom affordable housing unit (including land cost, the cost of construction,
interest cost, closing costs, and other costs allocable to such unit) exceed
the maximum amount for which that housing unit could be sold (as an affordable
housing unit) by the developer in accordance with Section 15-182.4, (ii)
the extent to which non-monetary factors might induce developers to prefer paying
a fee in lieu of constructing an affordable housing unit if the monetary cost of
doing one or the other were roughly equivalent, and (iii) any other factors the
Board deems relevant in establishing a fee that provides developers with a practical
and financially viable means of satisfying the Town’s affordable housing policy
goals. (AMENDED 10/28/08; 6/26/12)
(c) An applicant for approval of any residential development containing five or more
lots restricted to single-family residential use (which lots the developer intends to sell undeveloped)
who does not elect to meet the Board’s 15% affordable housing policy goal by donating
affordable housing lots (as those terms are described in Section 15-182.4) or making a payment
in lieu as provided in subsection (b) above shall nevertheless be considered to have met this goal
if such applicant chooses to follow the process that reserves lots for purchase by the Town of
Carrboro and makes a payment for the eventual purchase of such lots as outlined in this
subsection.
1) The developer shall request that a condition that obligates the developer to comply
with the provisions of this subsection be added to the special or conditional
use permit that authorizes the subdivision in question, and such condition shall
be added by the permit issuing authority.
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 14
2) Before the final plat is approved, the developer shall designate on the plat a number
of lots that are reserved for purchase by the Town of Carrboro. The number
of lots so reserved shall be equal to the product of the number of lots within such
subdivision multiplied by 0.15, rounded down to the nearest whole number.
3) The purchase price for each reserved lot shall be the estimated market price as
agreed upon by the Town and the developer, which price shall be specified in the
condition added to the special or conditional use permit.
4) The lots so designated shall be restricted by the permit to the development of affordable
housing as defined in Section 15-182.4 of this chapter.
5) The lots so designated shall be in all other ways equal to the market rate lots and
shall be provided with utility connections and other necessary infrastructure so as
to render them buildable at the time of sale.
6) With respect to all other lots within the subdivision, no certificate of occupancy
shall be issued for any dwelling unit constructed on such lots unless and until a
payment is made to the town in an amount determined as follows:
a. Prior to approval of the permit for such subdivision, the applicant for the
permit shall estimate the total market value of all developed lots (i.e. lots
with houses completed on them) within the subdivision that are not restricted
to affordable housing units, and calculate from this number the
percentage number that, when applied to the total market value of such
developed lots, would yield the number of dollars necessary to purchase
the lots within the subdivision that are restricted to affordable housing
use.
b. If the town accepts the percentage number derived above as a reasonable
estimate, such percentage shall be included as part of the condition on the
permit prohibiting the issuance of a certificate of occupancy until a payment
is made to the town as provided in this subsection.
c. The amount of the payment shall be determined by applying the percentage
determined in accordance with this subsection to the appraised value
of the completed house and lot, as determined by a licensed appraiser.
7) The funds so received shall be held and reserved for the purchase of the lots designated
to be developed with affordable housing.
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 15
8) The town shall have the right to purchase the designated lots at any time after final
plat approval, and must purchase the lots not later than ninety days after sufficient
funds to do so have been received by the town from the other lots.
9) If sufficient funds have not been received by the town to purchase one or more of
the affordable housing lots after the last certificate of occupancy is issued for the
other lots within the subdivision, then the town shall either purchase such affordable
housing lot or lots using such funds as may be available to the town within
ninety days after the date of issuance of such certificate of occupancy, or the condition
limiting the use of such designated lot or lots to affordable housing shall
be deemed to have expired and such designated lot or lots may thereafter be conveyed
without this restriction.
10) If the funds received exceed the amount necessary to purchase the lots that
have been reserved then such funds shall be retained in the fund and used for
other purposes authorized for that fund.
(d) The Board finds that some developers may not fully understand how the affordable
housing provisions of this chapter operate or the incentives that are available under the ordinance
to encourage affordable housing. Therefore, the Board concludes that, when developers of
proposed developments containing five or more dwelling units propose to construct such
developments without meeting the affordable housing goals established by the town for new
developments, it may be beneficial to both the developers and the town for the Board and such
developers to have an opportunity, prior to the formal consideration of a permit request, to
discuss the town’s affordable housing policy, the affordable housing opportunities and incentives
provided by this chapter, and any questions or concerns such developers may have about utilizing
those provisions. Subsections (e) and (f) below provide for that opportunity.
(e) The applicant for any residential development containing five or more lots or dwelling
units, and therefore required to obtain either a special use permit from the Board of Adjustment
or a conditional user permit from the Board of Aldermen, shall be required to participate in
an Affordable Housing Review Meeting with the Board of Aldermen if the residential development
does not meet the Board’s affordable housing goal in any of the ways described in this
section or Section 15-182.4.
(f) Should an applicant for any residential development containing five or more lots or
dwelling units decide in the course of the development review process to change the application
in such a way that it no longer satisfies the Board’s affordable housing policy goal, further review
of the project will be delayed until the applicant participates in an Affordable Housing Review
Meeting with the Board of Aldermen.
Section 15-55 Burden of Presenting Evidence, Burden of Persuasion.
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 16
(a) The burden of presenting a complete application (as described in Section 15-49) to
the permit-issuing board shall be upon the applicant. However, unless the board informs the
applicant at the hearing in what way the application is incomplete and offers the applicant an
opportunity to complete the application (either at that meeting or at a continuation hearing) the
application shall be presumed to be complete.
(b) Once a complete application has been submitted, the burden of presenting evidence
to the permit-issuing board sufficient to lead it to conclude that the application should be denied for
any reasons stated in Subdivisions 15-54(c)(1), (3), or (4) shall be upon the party or parties urging
this position, unless the information presented by the applicant in his application and at the public
hearing is sufficient to justify a reasonable conclusion that a reason exists for denying the
application as provided in Subdivision 15-54(c)(1), (3), or (4).
1) The burden of persuasion on the issue of whether the development, if
completed as proposed, will comply with the requirements of this chapter
remains at all times on the applicant. The burden of persuasion on the issue of
whether the application should be turned down for any of the reasons set forth in
Subdivision 15-54(c)(4) rests on the party or parties urging that the requested
permit should be denied.
Section 15-55.1 Findings and Burden of Proof for Conditional Use Permits Required for
Taller Buildings in Commercial Districts (AMENDED) 10/25/05.
If a conditional use permit for a development is required under Section 15-147 (j), then,
notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection 15-54 (c) and Section 15-55 of this chapter, the
applicant for such conditional use permit shall have the burden of demonstrating that, if completed
as proposed, the development:
(1) Will not substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting property; and
(2) Will be in harmony with the area in which it is to be located. The manner in
which a project is designed to accommodate additional building height including,
but not limited to, scale, architectural detailing, compatibility with the existing built
environment and with adopted policy statements in support of vibrant and
economically successful and sustainable, mixed- use, core commercial districts shall
be among the issues that may be considered to make a finding that a project is or is
not in harmony with the area in which it is to be located. The applicant may use a
variety of graphic and descriptive means to illustrate these findings.
(3) Will be in general conformity with the Land Use Plan, Thoroughfare Plan, and
other plans officially adopted by the Board.
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL

Section 15-56 Recommendation on Special Use Permit Applications.
(a) When presented to the board of adjustment at the hearing, the application for a
special use permit shall be accompanied by a report setting forth the planning staff’s proposed
findings concerning the application’s compliance with Section 15-49 (Application To Be
Complete) and the other requirements of this chapter, as well as any staff recommendations for
additional requirements to be imposed by the board of adjustment.
(b) If the staff proposes a finding or conclusion that the application fails to comply with
Section 15-49 or any other requirements of this chapter, it shall identify the requirement in question
and specifically state supporting reasons for the proposed findings or conclusions.
(c) The board of adjustment may, by general rule applicable to all cases or any class
of cases, or on a case by case basis, refer applications to the planning board, the transportation
advisory board, the environmental advisory board, the affordable housing advisory commission,
or the appearance commission to obtain the recommendations of some or all of these boards.

Section 15-57 Recommendations on Conditional Use Permits.
(a) Before being presented to the Board of Aldermen, an application for a conditional
use permit shall be referred to the planning board, appearance commission, environmental
advisory board, and the transportation advisory board for joint review and action in accordance
with this section. The Board of Aldermen may not hold a public hearing on a conditional use
permit application until the planning board, affordable housing advisory commission, appearance
commission, environmental advisory board, and the transportation advisory board have had an
opportunity to consider the application (pursuant to standard agenda procedures) at one regular
meeting. In addition, at the request of the planning board, appearance commission, environmental
advisory board or the transportation advisory board, the Board of Aldermen may continue the
public hearing to allow the respective boards more time to consider the application.
(AMENDED 09/19/19, REWRITTEN 02/25/14, AMENDED 06/25/19).
(b) When presented to the planning board, affordable housing advisory commission,
appearance commission, environmental advisory board and the transportation advisory board, the
application shall be accompanied by a report setting forth the planning staff’s proposed findings
concerning the application’s compliance with Section 15-49 and other requirements of this
chapter, as well as any staff recommendations for additional requirements to be imposed by the
Board of Aldermen. If the planning staff report proposes a finding or conclusion that the
application fails to comply with Section 15-49 or any other requirement of this chapter, it shall
identify the requirement in questions and specifically state supporting reasons for the proposed
findings and conclusions. (AMENDED 09/19/95, AMENDED 06/25/19).
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 18
(c) The planning board, affordable housing advisory commission, appearance
commission, environmental advisory board, and the transportation advisory board shall consider
the application and the attached staff report in a timely fashion, and may, in its discretion, hear
from the applicant or members of the public. (AMENDED 09/19/95, AMENDED 06/25/19).
(d) After reviewing the application, the planning board, affordable housing advisory
commission, appearance commission, environmental advisory board, and the transportation
advisory board shall report to the Board of Aldermen whether it concurs in whole part with the
staff’s proposed findings and conditions, and to the extent there are differences the respective
boards shall propose their own recommendations and the reasons therefore. (AMENDED
09/19/19, REWRITTEN 02/25/14, AMENDED 06/25/19).
(e) In response to the planning board’s, the affordable housing advisory commission’s,
appearance commission’s, environmental advisory board’s or the transportation advisory
board’s recommendations, the applicant may modify his application prior to submission to the
Board of Aldermen, and the planning staff may likewise revise its recommendations.
(AMENDED 09/19/19, REWRITTEN 02/25/14, AMENDED 06/25/19).
Section 15-58 Board Action On Special Use and Conditional Use Permits.
In considering whether to approve an application for a special or conditional use permit, the
board of adjustment or the Board of Aldermen shall proceed according to the following format:
(1) The board shall consider whether the application is complete. If no member moves
that the application be found incomplete (specifying either the particular type of
information lacking or the particular requirement with respect to which the
application is incomplete) then this shall be taken as an affirmative finding by the
board that the application is complete.
(2) The board shall consider whether the application complies with all of the applicable
requirements of this chapter. If a motion to this effect passes, the board need not
make further findings concerning such requirements. If such a motion fails or is not
made then a motion shall be made that the application be found not in compliance
with one or more of the requirements of this chapter. Such a motion shall specify
the particular requirements the application fails to meet. Separate votes may be
taken with respect to each requirement not met by the application. It shall be
conclusively presumed that the application complies with all requirements not found
by the board to be unsatisfied through this process.
(3) If the board concludes that the application fails to comply with one or more
requirements of this chapter, the application shall be denied. If the board concludes
that all such requirements are met, it shall issue the permit unless it adopts a motion
to deny the application for one or more of the reasons set forth in Subdivision 15-
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 19
54(c)(4). Such a motion shall propose specific findings, based upon the evidence
submitted, justifying such a conclusion.
Section 15-59 Additional Requirements on Special Use and Conditional Use Permits.
(a) Subject to subsection (b), in granting a special or conditional use permit,
the board of adjustment or Board of Aldermen, respectively, may attach to the permit such
reasonable requirements in addition to those specified in this chapter as will ensure that the
development in its proposed location: (AMENDED 3/23/10)
(1) Will not endanger the public health or safety; or
(2) Will not injure the value of adjoining or abutting property; or
(3) Will be in harmony with the area in which it is located; and or
(4) Will be in conformity with the Carrboro Land use Plan, Thoroughfare
Plan, or other plan officially adopted by the Board.
(b) The permit-issuing board may not attach additional conditions that modify or alter
the specific requirements set forth in this ordinance unless the development in question presents
extraordinary circumstances that justify the variation from the specified requirements.
(AMENDED 5/26/87)
(c) Without limiting the foregoing, the board may attach to a permit a condition limiting
the permit to a specified duration.
(d) In the case of a conditional use zoning district, specific conditions may be proposed
by the petitioner or the Town or its agencies, but only those conditions mutually approved
by the Town and the petitioner may be incorporated into the permit requirements. Conditions
and site-specific standards imposed in a conditional use permit as a part of a conditional use
zoning district shall be limited to those that address the conformance of the development and use
of the site to Town ordinances and any officially adopted comprehensive or other plan and those
that address the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the
site. (AMENDED 10/24/06)
(e) All additional conditions or requirements authorized by this section are enforceable
in the same manner and to the same extent as any other applicable requirement of this chapter.
(f) A vote may be taken on additional conditions or requirements before consideration
of whether the permit should be denied for any of the reasons set forth in Subdivision 15- 54(c)(3)
or (4).

Section 15-60 Authorizing Use, Occupancy, or Sale Before Completion of Development
Under Special Use or Conditional Use Permits (AMENDED 10/08/96; 10/24/06; 6/22/10).
(a) With respect to unsubdivided developments, in cases when, because of weather
conditions or other factors beyond the control of the special or conditional use permit recipient
(exclusive of financial hardship), it would be unreasonable to require the permit recipient to
comply with all of the requirements of this chapter (including approved plans) before commencing
the intended use of the property or occupying any buildings, the manager may authorize the
commencement of the intended use or occupancy of buildings (insofar as the requirements of this
chapter are concerned) if the permit recipient provides a surety bond, letter of credit or other
security satisfactory to the manager to ensure that all these requirements will be fulfilled within a
reasonable period of time (not to exceed twelve months) determined by the manager. The
developer shall choose which of the above listed performance guarantees to use. Upon a
showing of good cause, the manager may approve the extension of such security for successive
periods of up to twelve months each, so long as such extension does not compromise the health
or safety of the general public or the occupants of the property that is the subject of the permit.
(b) With respect to subdivided developments, the manager may authorize final plat
approval and the sale of lots before all the requirements of this chapter (including approved
plans) are fulfilled if the subdivider provides a surety bond, letter of credit, or other security
satisfactory to the manager to ensure that all of these requirements will be fulfilled within a
reasonable period of time after final plat approval (not to exceed twelve months) as determined
by the manager. The developer shall choose which of the above listed performance guarantees to
use. Upon a showing of good cause (by way of illustration without limitation, where it is
sensible to delay the final coat of pavement of a street until heavy construction within the
subdivision is essentially complete, or where completion of a bioretention area should be delayed
until site disturbance is nearly finished), the manager may approve the extension of such security
for successive periods of up to twelve months each, so long as such extension does not compromise
the health or safety of the general public or the occupants of the subdivision.
(c) The authorization provided to the manager under subsections (a) and (b) of this
section shall also apply to fulfillment of additional requirements upon the special or conditional
use permit recipient by the permit issuing board in accordance with Section 15-59 unless the
board specifies a certain date by which or a schedule according to which such requirements must
be met.
Section 15-61 Completing Developments in Phases.
(a) If a development is constructed in phases or stages in accordance with this section,
then, subject to subsection (c), the provisions of Section 15-47 (No Occupancy, Use, or Sale of Lots
Until Requirements Fulfilled) and Section 15-60 (exceptions to Section 15-47) shall apply to each
phase as if it were the entire development.
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 21
(b) As a prerequisite to taking advantage of the provisions of subsection (a), the
developer shall submit plans that clearly show the various phases or stages of the proposed
development and the requirements of this chapter that will be satisfied with respect to each phase or
stage.
(c) If a development that is to be built in phases or stages includes improvements that
are designed to relate to, benefit, or be used by the entire development (such as a swimming pool or
tennis courts in a residential development) then, as part of his application for development
approval, the developer shall submit a proposed schedule for completion of such improvements.
The schedule shall relate completion of such improvements to completion of one or more phases or
stages of the entire development. Once a schedule has been approved and made part of the permit
by the permit-issuing authority, no land may be used, no buildings may be occupied, and no
subdivision lots may be sold except in accordance with the schedule approved as part of the permit,
provided that:
(1) If the improvement is one required by this chapter then the developer may
utilize the provisions of Subsections 15-60(a) or 15-60(c);
(2) If the improvement is an amenity not required by this chapter or is provided
in response to a condition imposed by the board, then the developer may
utilize the provisions of Subsection 15-60(b).
(3) Changes in phasing schedules may be made in the same manner as other
permit modifications pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 15-64.
(AMENDED 2/24/87)
Section 15-62 Expiration of Permits.
(a) Zoning, special use, conditional use, and sign permits shall expire automatically if,
within two years after the issuance of such permits: (AMENDED 5/26/81)
(1) The use authorized by such permits has not commenced, in circumstances
where no substantial construction, erection, alteration, excavation,
demolition, or similar work is necessary before commencement of such use;
or
(2) Less than ten percent of the total cost of all construction, erection, alteration,
excavation, demolition, or similar work on any development authorized by
such permits has been completed on the site. With respect to phased
development (see Section 15-61), this requirement shall apply only to the
first phase.
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 22
(b) If, after some physical alteration to land or structures begins to take place, such work
is discontinued for a period (i) of one year if the date of discontinuance occurs more than one year
after the issuance of the permit, or (ii) equal to two years less the time between the issuance of the
permit and the time work is discontinued if the date of discontinuance occurs less than one year
after the issuance of the permit, then the permit authorizing such work shall immediately expire.
However, expiration of the permit shall not affect the provisions of Section 15-63.
(c) The permit-issuing authority may extend for a period up to two years the date when a
permit would otherwise expire pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) if it concludes that (i) the permit
has not yet expired, (ii) the permit recipient has proceeded with due diligence and in good faith, and
(iii) conditions have not changed so substantially as to warrant a new application. Successive
extensions may be granted for periods of up to two years upon the same findings. All such
extensions may be granted without resort to the formal processes and fees required for a new
permit. (AMENDED 06/23/15)
(d) For purposes of this section, a permit within the jurisdiction of the Board of
Aldermen or the board of adjustment is issued when such board votes to approve the application
and issue the permit. A permit within the jurisdiction of the zoning administrator is issued when
the earlier of the following takes place: (AMENDED 11/10/81)
(1) A copy of the fully executed permit is delivered to the permit recipient, and
delivery is accomplished when the permit is hand delivered or mailed to the
permit applicant; or
(2) The zoning administrator notifies the permit applicant that the application
has been approved and that all that remains before a fully executed permit
can be delivered is for the applicant to take certain specified actions, such as
having the permit executed by the property owner so it can be recorded if
required under G.S. 15-46(c).
(e) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of Article VIII (Nonconforming Situations),
this section shall be applicable to permits issued prior to the date this section becomes effective.
Section 15-63 Effect of Permit on Successors and Assigns.
(a) Zoning, special use, conditional use and sign permits authorize the permittee to
make use of the land and structures in a particular way. Such permits are transferable. However, so
long as the land or structures or any portion thereof covered under a permit continues to be used for
the purposes for which the permit was granted, then:
(1) No person (including successors or assigns of the person who obtained the
permit) may make use of the land or structures covered under such permit
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 23
for the purposes authorized in the permit except in accordance with all the
terms and requirements of that permit; and
(2) The terms and requirements of the permit apply to and restrict the use of
land or structures covered under the permit, not only with respect to all
persons having any interest in the property at the time the permit was
obtained, but also with respect to persons who subsequently obtain any
interest in all or part of the covered property and wish to use it for or in
connection with purposes other than those for which the permit was
originally issued, so long as the persons who subsequently obtain an interest
in the property had actual or record notice (as provided in subsection (b)) of
the existence of the permit at the time they acquired their interest.
(b) Whenever a zoning, special use or conditional use permit is issued to authorize
development (other than single-family residences or duplexes) on a tract of land in excess of one
acre, nothing authorized by the permit may be done until the record owner of the property signs a
written acknowledgment that the permit has been issued so that the permit may be recorded in the
Orange County Registry and indexed under the record owner’s name as grantor.
Section 15-64 Amendments to and Modifications of Permits. (AMENDED 5/25/04;
11/22/05).
(a) Subject to subsection (e), insignificant deviations from the permit (including
approved plans) issued by the Board of Aldermen, the board of adjustment, or the administrator are
permissible and the administrator may authorize such insignificant deviations. A deviation is
insignificant if it has no discernible impact on neighboring properties, the general public, or those
intended to occupy or use the proposed development. (AMENDED 5/26/81; 6/22/82)
(b) Subject to subsection (e), minor design modifications or changes in permits
(including approved plans) are permissible with the approval of the permit-issuing authority. Unless
it is requested by the permit-issuing authority, no public hearing shall be required for such minor
modification. For purposes of this section, minor design modifications or changes are those that
have no substantial impact on neighboring properties, the general public, or those intended to
occupy or use the proposed development. (AMENDED 6/22/82; 06/06/89)
(c) Subject to subsection (e), all other requests for changes in approved plans will be
processed as new applications. If such requests are required to be acted upon by the Board of
Aldermen or board of adjustment, new conditions may be imposed in accordance with Section
15-59, but the applicant retains the right to reject such additional conditions by withdrawing his
request for an amendment and may then proceed in accordance with the previously issued permit.
(AMENDED 6/22/82)
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 24
(d) The administrator shall determine whether amendments to and modifications of
permits fall within the categories set forth above in subsections (a), (b), and (c). (AMENDED
5/26/81)
(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, whenever the board issues
a conditional use permit for a planned industrial development (use classification 30.000), the
administrator may authorize changes in the approved plans for such development that do not
substantially alter the character or pattern of development approved by the board, so long as the
revised plans continue to comply with the provisions of this chapter and any conditions imposed by
the board in issuing the permit. In granting a permit for a planned industrial development, the
board may identify more specifically those elements of the plans concerning which changes may be
approved by the administrator under this subsection. (AMENDED 6/22/82)
(f) An applicant requesting a change in approved plans shall point out to the
administrator, specifically and in writing, what deviation or changes are requested. The
administrator shall respond in writing. No changes shall be authorized except in conformity with
this section. (AMENDED 1/22/85)
(g) When (i) a request for a change in a permit is made under this section (whether for
an insignificant deviation, minor modification, or major modification), and (ii) the use of the
property is not changed, and (iii) some type of nonconforming situation other than a nonconforming
use exists on the property, then the permit change may be approved without requiring the
elimination of the nonconforming situations. However, (i) any new development authorized by
the permit change shall comply with current standards to the extent reasonably practicable, and
(ii) the permit issuing authority may require the elimination of nonconforming situations when
the cost (financial and otherwise) of doing so is clearly proportional to the benefits of elimination
of such nonconformity.
(h) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, whenever town-owned facilities
or services are proposed as an additional use on property for which a special use permit or a
conditional use permit is already in effect the permit required by this article for the new townowned
facility or service shall be as shown in Section 15-146. (AMENDED 11/25/05)
Section 15-65 Reconsideration of Board Action.
Whenever (i) the Board of Aldermen disapproves a conditional use permit application, or
(ii) the board of adjustment disapproves an application for a special use permit or a variance, on any
basis other than the failure of the applicant to submit a complete application, such action may not
be reconsidered by the respective board at a later time unless the applicant clearly demonstrates
that:
(1) Circumstances affecting the property that is the subject of the application
have substantially changed; or
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 25
(2) The application is changed in some substantial way; or
(3) New information is available that could not with reasonable diligence have
been presented at a previous hearing.
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 26
Section 15-66 Applications to be Processed Expeditiously.
Recognizing that inordinate delays in acting upon appeals or applications may impose
unnecessary costs on the appellant or applicant, the town shall make every reasonable effort to
process appeals and permit applications as expeditiously as possible, consistent with the need to
ensure that all development conforms to the requirements of this chapter.
Section 15-67 Maintenance of Common Areas, Improvements, and Facilities.
The recipient of any zoning, special use, conditional use, or sign permit, or his successor,
shall be responsible for maintaining all common areas, improvements or facilities required by this
chapter or any permit issued in accordance with its provisions, except those areas, improvements or
facilities with respect to which an offer of dedication to the public has been accepted by the
appropriate public authority. As illustrations, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
this means that private roads and parking areas, water and sewer lines, and recreational facilities
must be properly maintained so that they can be used in the manner intended, and required
vegetation and trees used for screening, landscaping, or shading must be replaced if they die or are
destroyed.

Section 15-81 Plat Approval Not Acceptance of Dedication Offers.
Approval of a plat does not constitute acceptance by the town of the offer of dedication of
any streets, sidewalks, parks or other public facilities shown on a plat. However, the town may
accept any such offer of dedication by resolution of the Board, by issuing to the dedicator a written
notice of acceptance signed by the town manager, or by actually exercising control over and
maintaining such facilities. (AMENDED 06/06/89)
Section 15-82 Protection Against Defects.
(a) Whenever (pursuant to Section 15-60) occupancy, use or sale is allowed before the
completion of all facilities or improvements intended for dedication, then the performance bond or
the surety that is posted pursuant to Section 15-60 shall guarantee that any defects in such facilities
or improvements that appear within fifteen months after the offer of dedication of such facilities or
improvements is accepted shall be corrected by the developer. (AMENDED 04/27/82; 06/06/89)
(b) Whenever all facilities or improvements intended for dedication are installed before
occupancy, use or sale is authorized, then the developer shall post a performance bond or other
sufficient surety to guarantee that he will correct all defects in such facilities or improvements that
occur within fifteen months after the offer of dedication of such facilities is accepted. (AMENDED
04/27/82; 06/06/89)
(c) An architect or engineer retained by the developer shall certify to the town that all
facilities and improvements to be dedicated to the town have been constructed in accordance with
the requirements of this chapter. This certification shall be a condition precedent to acceptance by
the town of the offer of dedication of such facilities or improvements.
(d) For purposes of this section, the term “defects” refers to any condition in publicly
dedicated facilities or improvements that requires the town to make repairs in such facilities over
and above the normal amount of maintenance that they would require. If such defects appear, the
guaranty may be enforced regardless of whether the facilities or improvements were constructed in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
Section 15-83 Maintenance of Dedicated Areas Until Acceptance.
As provided in Section 15-67, all facilities and improvements with respect to which the
owner makes an offer of dedication to public use shall be maintained by the owner until such offer
of dedication is accepted by the appropriate public authority.

Section 15-83.1 Display of Approved Site Plan Required (AMENDED 01/28/92).
(a) Prior to final plat approval, the developer of any residential subdivision that contains
or is designed to contain when fully developed a total of more than four lots shall display in a
prominent outdoor location on the development site a copy of a site plan drawn at a minimum scale
of 1” = 100’ that shows town approved lot configurations, easements, street patterns, amenities, and
other design features that may affect the use or enjoyment of property purchased within such
development. Included on the site plan shall be a prominently displayed notice advising prospective
purchasers to contact the Carrboro Planning Department for additional information concerning the
approved development plans.
(b) For purposes of this section the term “design features” includes but is not limited to
water, sewer, or electric power easements, recreational amenities, street extensions or future streets,
bikeways, and proposed future phases. When a private street is proposed, such signs shall indicate
that maintenance will be the responsibility of a homeowners association.
(c) The site plan required under this section shall be placed within a weatherproof
display case. It shall be regarded as a continuing condition of the developer’s permit that the site
plan displayed under this section shall be kept current as changes in development plans are
approved by the town and shall remain at all times sufficiently legible to satisfy the disclosure
objectives of this section. The site plan shall remain on display as lots within the subdivision
remain in the possession of the developer to whom the conditional use permit was granted or his
successors.
(d) The site plan displayed in accordance with this section as well as the location and
construction of the display case shall be subject to the prior approval of the zoning administrator,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
(e) The site plan display required under this section shall not be regarded as a sign for
purposes of Article XVII of this chapter.

(a) Prior to final plat approval, the developer of any residential subdivision that contains
or is designed to contain when fully developed to total of more than four lots may be required by
the permit issuing board to post a sufficient number of signs throughout the subdivision in
appropriate locations to provide notification (to the extent reasonably practicable) to the prospective
purchasers of lots or dwelling units within the area for which final plat approval is requested of
design features proposed for the subdivision that may significantly affect the use or enjoyment of
property purchased within the subdivision.
(b) For purposes of this section the term “design features” includes but is not limited to
water, sewer, or electric power easements, recreational amenities, street extensions or future streets,
bikeways, and proposed future phases. When a private street is proposed, such signs shall indicate
that maintenance will be the responsibility of a homeowners association.
(c) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, no signs need be posted where
the impact of the design feature is evident upon inspection of the property (e.g., a power line or
sewer line is already constructed and the easement boundaries are apparent).
(d) Signs posted in conformity with this section shall remain so long as lots within the
subdivision remain in the possession of the developer to whom the special or conditional use permit
was granted or his successor, and it shall be regarded as a continuing condition of the permit
authorizing the subdivision that such signs be maintained to serve the purposes intended by this
section. However, in any enforcement action it shall be a valid defense for the developer to show
that signs have been posted as required but have been deliberately removed or destroyed without
such developer’s consent or acquiescence.
(e) The developer of a subdivision that is subject to the provisions of this section shall
submit with his application for a conditional or special use permit a sign plan that shows the
location, size, design and content of every sign proposed to be posted to satisfy the requirements of
this action. The permit issuing board shall approve the plan if it demonstrates substantial
compliance with this action. Signs erected or posted pursuant to such an approved sign plan are
exempt from the provisions of Article XVII of this chapter. Signs shall be erected prior to final plat
approval for each phase.
Section 15-83.3 Covenants May Not Prohibit Devices that Generate or Conserve Energy or
Water (AMENDED 04/26/11).
(a) This section is authorized by Chapter 42 7 of the 2009 Session Laws, codified as
Section 10-2 of the Carrboro Town Charter.
(b) Subject to the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section, lots within a
residential subdivision may not be conveyed subject to covenants or restrictions that run with the
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 36
land unless, prior to approval of the final plat creating such lots, the final plat approval authority
(planning director for minor subdivisions and town manager for major subdivisions) has
determined that such covenants or restrictions are consistent with the requirements of this
section. The developer shall submit any such proposed covenants to the town along with or
subsequent to the proposed final plat. Final plat approval for such subdivision may not be
granted if the covenants or restrictions prohibit, or have the effect of prohibiting, or allow a
property owners association to prohibit, the orderly installation of solar collectors, clotheslines,
rain barrels, garden fences, or any further technology or device designed specifically to generate
or conserve energy through the use of renewable resources or to capture, store, or reuse water, so
long as such installation is done by or on behalf of a person who otherwise has a property right to
install such device.
(c) The provisions of subsection (b) of this section do not apply to any condominium
created under Chapter 47A or 47C of the General Statutes. Nor are such provisions intended to
prohibit the adoption or enforcement of any covenant or restriction, or any rule or regulation
adopted by a property owners association, that does any of the following:
(1) Affects a common area.
(2) Is designed to ensure that any device described in subsection (b) is installed and
maintained in such a manner that it does not pose a risk to the safety of any person
or domesticated animal.
(3) Regulates the location or screening of any device described in subsection (b),
provided the covenant or restriction, or rule or regulation adopted by a property
owners association, does not have the effect of preventing the reasonable use of
such device.
(d) The provisions of this section apply only to covenants or restrictions recorded
after the effective date of this section.

PART III. CONSTRUCTION DRAWING APPROVAL (AMENDED 06/06/89)
Section 15-84 Construction Drawings Shall Conform To Land Use Permit Plans.
(a) Construction drawings prepared for development projects and prepared in
accordance with Section 15-49 (c) shall conform to the plans which have been approved as part of
the appropriate land use permitting process (zoning permit, special use permit, or conditional use
permit). In the event that the detailed site work which is required for the preparation of
construction drawings makes necessary modifications or deviations from the general design
approved during the land use permitting process, such changes may require additional review by the
relevant permit-issuing authority, as described in Section 15-64, prior to the start of construction
plan review.
(b) For utility extension projects, which are exempted from the requirement to obtain a
zoning, special use or conditional use permit by the provisions of Section 15-151, construction
plans shall be submitted to and approved by the public works director prior to the commencement
of construction activity.
Section 15-85 Construction Drawing Submittal Process.
As set forth in Section 15-49 (c), persons desiring to construct any development project in
the area within the town’s planning jurisdiction may be required to submit construction drawings
for review and approval by the town. Submittal of construction drawings shall be made only after a
land use permit (zoning, special use, or conditional use permit) has been issued for the project in
question, and filed with the Orange County Register of Deeds, if required by Section 15-63.
Construction drawings are to be submitted to the land use administrator for review and approval in
accordance with the process described below.
(a) PRE-SUBMITTAL CONFERENCE. Persons preparing construction drawings are
requested to confer with the land use administrator prior to making the formal construction
drawings submittal described below in subsection (b). This conference is suggested in order to
minimize the time required for the construction drawing review process. It is especially encouraged
where such drawings will require modifications to the plans approved as part of the land use
permitting process in order to comply with the provisions of Section 15-84. As described in
Section 15-64, land use permit modifications can require additional review by the permit-issuing
authority, prior to construction plan review.
(b) INITIAL SUBMITTAL. Four (4) complete sets of construction drawings shall be
submitted to the land use administrator for review. Construction drawing size and content shall
conform to the requirements set forth in Section 15-87. The land use administrator will review the
initial submittal and will send the applicant written comments outlining the additions or corrections
that are considered necessary.
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 38
(c) DRAWINGS REVISED AND RESUBMITTED. After receiving the land use
administrator’s comments on the initial submittal, the applicant shall revise the drawings to
incorporate those comments. The applicant shall resubmit four (4) sets of revised construction
drawings for review. The land use administrator will review the revised drawings and will send the
applicant written comments outlining any additions or corrections that may still be considered
necessary. The applicant shall then revise the construction drawings accordingly. This process
shall continue until such time as the land use administrator is satisfied as to the sufficiency of the
drawings and their conformance with the required standard specifications included in Appendix C.
(d) FINAL SUBMITTAL. Once the land use administrator is satisfied as to the sufficiency
of the construction drawings, a full set of final construction drawing materials shall be submitted
for approval. These materials shall include at a minimum:
(1) five (5) complete sets of final construction drawings, including all the
revisions as requested by the land use administrator, and sealed by the
professional engineer responsible for their preparation. Materials that must
be included in a complete set of construction drawings are described in
Section 15-87 below;
(2) a letter from the Orange Water and Sewer Authority, if applicable, certifying
their approval of the final construction drawings;
(3) letters from the appropriate utility providers certifying their approval of the
final construction drawings;
(4) copies of any applicable state or federal permits or approvals;
(5) a copy of the Orange County Sedimentation and Erosion Control permit, if
required, or a copy of correspondence from the Erosion Control Office
indicating that a permit is not required;
(6) a copy of all approved driveway permits and/or encroachment agreements
from the North Carolina Department of Transportation.
The land use administrator shall review the final construction drawing package submittal,
shall approve them for construction if they are found to be complete and sufficient, and shall notify
the applicant in writing of the approval.
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 39
Section 15-86 Record Drawings.
Upon completion of construction, a set of record drawings reflecting as-built conditions
must be submitted prior to the final acceptance of the streets and any other facilities by the town.
The record drawings must be labeled RECORD DRAWINGS and sealed and signed by the
engineer preparing them. The record drawings shall be permanent reproducible drawings, on
mylar, 2 mil minimum weight.
Section 15-87 Construction Drawing Submittal Requirements.
(a) CERTIFICATION OF DRAWINGS. All construction drawings submitted shall be
signed by and carry the seal of the professional engineer, professional architect or professional
landscape architect responsible for that preparation, who shall be licensed to practice in the State of
North Carolina. (AMENDED 10/9/90)
(b) MATERIALS TO BE SUBMITTED AS PART OF THE CONSTRUCTION DRAWINGS
PACKAGE: A complete set of construction drawings submitted in accordance with the provisions of
Section 15-49 (c) shall include at least the following items. The Town’s required standard

PART IV. ADEQUATE PUBLIC SCHOOL FACILITIES (JULY 17, 2003)
Section 15-88 Purpose.
The purpose of this Part IV is to ensure that, to the maximum extent practical, approval of
new residential development will become effective only when it can reasonably be expected that
adequate public school facilities will be available to accommodate such new development.
Section 15-88.1 Certificate of Adequacy of Public School Facilities.
(a) Subject to the remaining provisions of this part, no approval under this ordinance
of a conditional or special use permit for a residential development shall become effective unless
and until Certificate of Adequacy of Public School Facilities (CAPS) for the project has been
issued by the School District. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this subsection shall not apply to
conditional use permits for residential developments less than five lots or dwelling units in the
WR, B-5 and WM-3 zoning districts.
(b) A CAPS shall not be required for a general use or conditional use rezoning or for
a master land use plan. However, even if a rezoning or master plan is approved, a CAPS will
nevertheless be required before any of the permits or approvals identified in subsection (a) of this
section shall become effective, and the rezoning of the property or approval of a master plan
provides no indication as to whether the CAPS will be issued. The application for rezoning or
master plan approval shall contain a statement to this effect.
(c) A CAPS must be obtained from the School District. The School District will issue
or deny a CAPS in accordance with the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding
between Carrboro, Chapel Hill, Orange County, and the Chapel Hill Carrboro School District
dated July 17, 2003.
(d) A CAPS attaches to the land in the same way that development permission attaches
to the land. A CAPS may be transferred along with other interests in the property with respect
to which such CAPS is issued, but may not be severed or transferred separately.
Section 15-88.2 Service Levels.
(a) This section describes the service levels regarded as adequate by the parties to the
Memorandum of Understanding described in subsection (b) with respect to public school
facilities.
(b) As provided in the Memorandum of Understanding between Orange County,
Chapel Hill, Carrboro, and the Chapel Hil1/Carrboro School District, adequate service levels for
public schools shall be deemed to exist with respect to a proposed new residential development
if, given the number of school age children projected to reside in that development, and
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 42
considering all the factors listed in the Memorandum of Understanding, projected school
membership for the elementary schools, the middle schools, and the high school(s) within the
Chapel Hil1/Carrboro School District will not exceed the following percentages of the building
capacities of each of the following three school levels:
Elementary school level 105%
Middle school level 107%
High school level 110%
For the period of time beginning the effective date of this ordinance and terminating on the day
on which the third high school within the Chapel Hill-Carrboro City School District is first
attended by high school students, the determination by the Chapel Hill-Carrboro City School
District that adequate service levels for public schools exist shall be made without regard to
whether or not projected capacity of the High School level exceeds 110% of Building Capacity.
On and after the day on which the third high school within the Chapel Hill-Carrboro City School
District is first attended by high school students, determination by the Chapel Hill-Carrboro City
School District that adequate service levels for public schools exist shall be made only if
projected capacity of each school level does not exceed the following:
Elementary School 105% of Building Capacity
Middle School 107% of Building Capacity
High School 110% of Building Capacity
For purposes of this ordinance, the terms "building capacity" and "school membership" shall
have the same meaning attributed in the Schools Adequate Public Facilities Memorandum of
Understanding among the Towns of Carrboro, Chapel Hill, Orange County, and the Chapel
Hill/Carrboro Board of Education.
Section 15-88.3 Expiration of Certificates of Adequacy of Public School Facilities.
A CAPS issued in connection with approval of a conditional or special use permit shall
expire automatically upon the expiration of such permit approval.
Section 15-88.4 Exemption From Certification Requirement for Development with
Negligible Student Generation Rates.
In recognition of the fact that some new development will have a negligible impact on
school capacity, a CAPS shall not be required under the following circumstances:
a. For residential developments restricted by law and/or covenant for a period of at
least thirty years to housing for the elderly and/or adult care living and/or adult
special needs;
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 43
b. For residential developments restricted for a period of at least thirty years to dormitory
housing for university students.
If the use of a development restricted as provided above changes, then before a permit authorizing
such change of use becomes effective, a CAPS must be issued just as if the development
were being constructed initially.
Section 15-88.5 Applicability to Previously Approved Projects and Projects Pending
Approval.
(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of this part shall only apply to
applications for approval of conditional or special use permits that are submitted for approval
after the effective date of this ordinance.
(b) The provisions of this part shall not apply to amendments to special or conditional
use permit approvals issued prior to the effective date of this ordinance so long as the approvals
have not expired and the proposed amendments do not increase the number of dwelling units
authorized within the development by more than five percent or five dwelling units, whichever is
less.
(c) The Board of Aldermen shall issue a special exception to the CAPS requirement
to an applicant whose application for approval of a conditional or special use permit covers
property within a planned unit development or master plan project that was approved prior to the
effective date of this ordinance, if the Board of Aldermen finds, after an evidentiary hearing, that
the applicant has (1) applied to the School District for a CAPS and the application has been
denied, (2) in good faith made substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations
in reasonable reliance on the previously obtained planned unit development or master plan
approval, and (3) would be unreasonably prejudiced if development in accordance with the
previously approved development or plan is delayed due to the provisions of this ordinance. In
deciding whether these findings can be made, the Board of Aldermen shall consider the
following, among other relevant factors:
(1) Whether the developer has installed streets, utilities, or other facilities or
expended substantial sums in the planning and preparation for installation of such
facilities which were designed to serve or to be paid for in part by the development
of portions of the planned unit development or master planned project that
have not yet been approved for construction;
(2) Whether the developer has installed streets, utilities, or other facilities or
expended substantial sums in the planning and preparation for installation of such
facilities that directly benefit other properties outside the development in question
or the general public;
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 44
(3) Whether the developer has donated land to the School District for the construction
of school facilities or otherwise dedicated land or made improvements
deemed to benefit the School District and its public school system;
(4) Whether the developer has had development approval for a substantial
amount of time and has in good faith worked to timely implement the plan in reasonable
reliance on the previously obtained approval;
(5) The duration of the delay that will occur until public school facilities are
improved or exist to such an extent that a CAPS can be issued for the project, and
the effect of such delay on the development and the developer.
(d) The decision of the Board of Aldermen involving a special exception application
under subsection (c) is subject to review by the Orange County Superior Court by proceedings in
the nature of certiorari. Any petition for review by the Superior Court shall be filed with the
Clerk of Superior Court within 30 days after a written copy of the decision of the Board of
Aldermen is delivered to the applicant and every other party who has filed a written request for
such copy with the Clerk to the Board of Aldermen at the time of its hearing on the application
for a special exception. The written copy of the decision of the Board of Aldermen may be
delivered either by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested.
(e) The Mayor or any member temporarily acting as Mayor may, in his or her official
capacity, administer oaths to witnesses in any hearing before the Board of Aldermen concerning
a special exception.
Section 15-88.6 Appeal of School District Denial of a CAPS.
The applicant for a CAPS which is denied by the School District may, within 30 days of
the date of the denial, appeal the denial to the Board of Aldermen. Any such appeal shall be
heard by the Board of Aldermen at an evidentiary hearing before it. At this hearing the School
District will present its reasons for the denial of the CAPS and the evidence it relied on in
denying the CAPS. The applicant appealing the denial may present its reasons why the CAPS
application should have, in its view, been approved and the evidentiary basis it contends supports
approval. The Board of Aldermen may (1) affirm the decision of the School District, (2) remand
to the School District for further proceedings in the event evidence is presented at the hearing
before the Board of Aldermen not brought before the School District, or (3) issue a CAPS. The
Board of Aldermen will only issue a CAPS if it finds that the CAPS should have been issued by
the School District as prescribed in the Memorandum of Understanding among the School
District, Orange County and the towns of Carrboro and Chapel Hill. A decision of the Board of
Aldermen affirming the School District may be appealed by the applicant for a CAPS by
proceedings in the nature of certiorari and as prescribed for an appeal under section 15-88.5 of
this part.
Art. IV PERMITS AND FINAL PLAT APPROVAL
Page 45
Section 15-88.7 Information Required From Applicants.
The applicant for a CAPS shall submit to the School District all information reasonably
deemed necessary by the School District to determine whether a CAPS should be issued under
the provision of the Memorandum of Understanding. An applicant for a CAPS special exception
or an applicant appealing a CAPS denial by the School District shall submit to the Board of
Aldermen all information reasonably deemed necessary by the Board of Aldermen to determine
whether a special exception should be granted as provided in Section 15-88.5 or for the hearing
of an appeal of a School District denial of a CAPS as provided in Section 15-88.6. A copy of a
request for a CAPS special exception or of an appeal of a School District denial of a CAPS shall
be served on the superintendent of the School District. Service may be made by personal delivery
or certified mail, return receipt requested.

Section 15-91 Appeals (AMENDED 06/21/94; 04/23/96; 5/21/02; REPEALED 4/27/82;
REWRITTEN 10/21/14)
(a) The board of adjustment shall hear and decide appeals of decisions of the
administrator in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 160A-388. Those provisions are
summarized in the remaining subsections of this section. For purposes of this section, the term
“decision” includes any final and binding order, requirement, or determination made by the
administrator.
(b) The administrator shall give written notice of the decision to the owner of the property
that is the subject of the decision and to the party who sought the decision, if different from the
owner. The written notice shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first- class
mail.
(c) Any person who has standing under G.S. 160A-393(d), as well as the town, may appeal
a decision to the board of adjustment. An appeal is taken by filing a notice of appeal with the town
clerk. The notice of appeal shall state the grounds for the appeal.
(d) The owner or other party shall have 30 days from receipt of the written notice within
which to file an appeal. Any other person with standing to appeal shall have 30 days from receipt
from any source of actual or constructive notice of the decision within which to file an appeal.
(e) It shall be conclusively presumed that all persons with standing to appeal have
constructive notice of the decision from the date a sign containing the words "Zoning
Decision" or "Subdivision Decision" in letters at least six inches high is prominently posted on the
property that is the subject of the decision, provided that (i) the sign remains on the property for at
least 10 days, and (ii) and the sign states that additional information about the decision can be
obtained by calling the planning department at a specified telephone number. Posting of such signs
shall not be required, and is not the only form of constructive notice, but such posting offers the
applicant or landowner a means of ensuring that constructive notice of the decision has been
provided. Verification of the posting shall be provided to the administrator.
(f) The administrator shall transmit to the board of adjustment all documents and exhibits
constituting the record of the action that is the subject of the appeal. The administrator shall also
provide a copy of the record to the appellant and to the owner of the property that is the subject of
the appeal if the appellant is not the owner.
(g) An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays enforcement of the
action appealed from unless the administrator certifies to the board of adjustment after notice of
Art. V - APPEALS, VARIANCES, INTERPRETATIONS
Page #2
appeal has been filed that, because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause imminent
peril to life or property, or because the violation is transitory in nature, a stay would seriously
interfere with enforcement of the ordinance. In that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be
stayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings
are not stayed, the appellant may file with the administrator a request for an expedited hearing of
the appeal, and the board of adjustment shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after such a
request is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a permit or otherwise
affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the ordinance shall not stay the further
review of an application for permits or permissions to use such property; in these situations the
appellant may request and the board may grant a stay of a final decision of permit applications or
building permits affected by the issue being appealed.
(h) Subject to the provisions of subdivision (g) of this section, the board of adjustment shall
hear and decide the appeal within a reasonable time.
(i) The administrator shall be present at the hearing as a witness. The appellant shall not be
limited at the hearing to matters stated in the notice of appeal. If any party or the town would be
unduly prejudiced by the presentation of matters not presented in the notice of appeal, the board
shall continue the hearing. The board of adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may
modify the decision appealed from and shall make any order, requirement, decision, or
determination that ought to be made. The board shall have all the powers of the administrator.
(j) The parties to an appeal that has been made under this section may agree to mediation or
other forms of alternative dispute resolution.
Section 15-92 Variances (AMENDED 11/10/81; 4/21/87; 12/05/89; 04/23/96; 10/24/06; 6/26/12;
10/21/14; REPEALED & AMENDED 3/24/09; REWRITTEN 10/26/10)
(a) An application for a variance shall be submitted to the board of adjustment by filing a
copy of the application with the administrator in the planning department. Applications shall be
handled in the same manner as applications for special use permits in conformity with the
provisions of Sections 15-48, 15-49, and 15-56.
(b) Subject to the remaining provisions of this section, when unnecessary hardships would
result from carrying out the strict letter of this ordinance, the board of adjustment shall vary any of
the provisions of the ordinance upon a showing of all of the following:
(1) Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of this ordinance.
It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no
reasonable use can be made of the property.
(2) The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as
location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances,
as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the
neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance
Art. V - APPEALS, VARIANCES, INTERPRETATIONS
Page #3
(3) The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property
owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist
that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created
hardship
(4) The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the
ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved.
(c) No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance.
(d) Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided the conditions are
reasonably related to the variance.
(e) A variance may be issued for an indefinite duration or for a specified duration only.
(f) In determining whether a variance should be granted from any of the provisions of
Article XVI, Part I, the board of adjustment shall consider the following factors, each of which shall
be addressed in a written report that accompanies the application.
(1) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and
the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community;
(5) The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion
damage, for the proposed use;
(6) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
(7) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
(8) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
(9) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport
of the floodwaters expected at the site; and
(10) The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.
(g) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted from the provisions of Article
XVI, Part I, shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the Base Flood
Elevation (BFE) and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and that such construction
below the BFE increases risks to life and property, and that the issuance of a variance to construct a
structure below the BFE will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25 per
$100 of insurance coverage. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance

Section 15-92.1 Special Exception Permits (AMENDED 06/21/94).
[PLEASE REFERENCE “APPENDIX H” ]
(a) An application for a special exception permit shall be submitted to the board of
adjustment by filing a copy of the application with the administrator in the planning department.
(b) All of the provisions of this article applicable to the processing of variance
applications shall also apply to special exception permit requests, except the provisions of
Subsections 15-92(b) and 15-96(b) and (c).
(c) The board of adjustment may issue a special exception permit for the purposes and
under the circumstances set forth in the remaining subsections of this section if it concludes, in
addition to any other findings required below, that:
(1) Issuance of the permit will not create a threat to the public health or safety;
and
(2) Issuance of the permit will not adversely affect the value of adjoining or
neighboring properties. If the applicant presents a petition, signed by the
owners of all properties entitled to receive notice of the hearing on the
application pursuant to Section 15-102(2), and stating that such property
owners believe their property values will not be adversely affected by the
proposed use, this shall be sufficient evidence from which the board may
(but shall not be required to) make the required finding. The board may also
make the required finding based on other competent evidence.
(d) The board of adjustment may issue a special exception permit under this section to
allow a reduction of up to 50% in the required distances that buildings must be set back from lot
boundary lines under Subsection 15-184(a)(4), provided that:
(1) The reduction may be permitted only for buildings on lots used for
conforming residential purposes in residential districts, where (i) the
building in question has existed for at least three years prior to the
Art. V - APPEALS, VARIANCES, INTERPRETATIONS
Page #6
application for the special exception permit, or (ii) the lot is to be developed
or redeveloped using the residential density bonus for affordable housing
provided for elsewhere in this chapter at Section 15-184. (Amended
5/14/02)
(2) In no case may the reduction allow a building to be located closer to a lot
boundary line than a distance equal to one-half of the minimum building
separation requirement established by the North Carolina State Building
Code or allow the location of a building in such proximity to a pre-existing
building as to violate the minimum building separation requirement of the
North Carolina State Building Code;
(3) Reductions may be allowed under this section only for setbacks from lot
boundary lines, not setbacks from street right-of-way lines.
(e) The board of adjustment may issue a special exception permit to authorize a
structure to encroach upon a setback required under Section 15-184 if it finds that:
(1) The proposed encroachment results from an addition to or an extension of an
existing structure that already is nonconforming with respect to the
requirements of section 15-184; and
(2) The proposed addition or extension will not encroach upon any required
front, rear, or side yard to a greater extent than the existing structure on that
lot.
Section 15-93 Interpretations (REWRITTEN 10/21/14)
(a) The administrator is authorized to interpret the official zoning map and to pass upon
disputed questions of district boundary lines and similar questions.
(b) Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the Official
Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
(1) Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of alleys,
streets, highways, streams, or railroads shall be construed to follow such
centerlines;
(2) Boundaries indicated as approximately following lot lines, city limits, or
extraterritorial boundary lines shall be construed as following such lines,
limits or boundaries;
(3) Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to follow
such shorelines, and in the event of change in the shoreline shall be
construed as following such shorelines;
Art. V - APPEALS, VARIANCES, INTERPRETATIONS
Page #7
(4) Where a district boundary divides a lot or where distances are not
specifically indicated on the Official Zoning Map, the boundary shall be
determined by measurements, using the scale of the Official Zoning Map;
(5) Where any street or alley is hereafter officially vacated or abandoned, the
regulation applicable to each parcel of abutting property shall apply to that
portion of such street or alley added thereto by virtue of such vacation or
abandonment.
Section 15-94 Requests To Be Heard Expeditiously.
As provided in Section 15-66, the board of adjustment shall hear and decide all appeals,
variance requests, and requests for interpretations as expeditiously as possible, consistent with the
need to follow regularly established agenda procedures, provide notice in accordance with Article
VI, and obtain the necessary information to make sound decisions.

(a) With respect to appeals, a motion to reverse, affirm, or modify the order, requirement,
decision, or determination appealed from shall include, insofar as practicable, a statement of the
specific reasons or findings that support that motion. If a motion to reverse or modify is not made or
fails to receive the four-fifths vote necessary for adoption (see Section 15-32), then a motion to
uphold the decision appealed from shall be in order. Insofar as practicable, this motion shall include
a statement of the findings, or reasons that support it. This motion is adopted as the board’s
decision if supported by at least two members.
(b) Before granting a variance, the board must take a separate vote and vote affirmatively
(by a 4/5 majority--see Section 15-32) on each of the four required findings stated in Subsection 15-
92(b). Insofar as practicable, a motion to make an affirmative finding on each of the requirements
set forth in Subsection 15-92(b) shall include a statement of the specific reasons for findings of fact
supporting such motion.
(c) A motion to deny a variance may be made on the basis that any one or more of the four
criteria set forth in Subsection 15-92(b) are not satisfied or that the application is incomplete.
Insofar as practicable, such a motion shall include a statement of the specific reasons or findings of
fact that support it. This motion is adopted as the board’s decision if supported by at least two
members.
(d) Before granting a special exception permit, the board shall vote affirmatively on each of
the findings required under section 15-92.1. A motion to deny a special exception may be made on

the basis that any one or more of the findings required by section 15-92.1 are not satisfied or that
the application is incomplete. Insofar as practicable, such a motion shall include a statement of the
specific reasons or findings of fact that support it.

Federal Fair Housing Act and Americans with Disabilities Act under the circumstances set forth
in this section.
(b) An application for a reasonable accommodation may be filed only by the owner

specifically authorized by the owner to file such application; or any unit of government
that is not the owner of the lot but proposes to acquire the lot by purchase, gift or
condemnation.
(c) An application for a reasonable accommodation shall be filed with the Administrator

(e) The quasi-judicial hearing shall be noticed in accordance with Section 15-102(1) and
conducted in accordance with Sections 15-103 through 15-106 to the extent not inconsistent
with this Section.
(f) The Board shall grant a reasonable accommodation to any provision of the Land Use
Ordinance if the Board finds by the greater weight of the evidence that the proposed reasonable
accommodation is both reasonable and necessary, in accordance with the following:
(1) Reasonable: An accommodation will be determined to be reasonable if it would not
undermine the legitimate purposes and effects of existing zoning regulations, and if
it will not impose significant financial and administrative burdens upon the Town
and/or constitute a substantial or fundamental alteration of the Town’s Land Use
Ordinance provisions; and
(2) Necessary: An accommodation will be determined to be necessary if it would provide
direct or meaningful therapeutic amelioration of the effects of the particular disaArt.

enjoy and use housing in residential districts in the Town.
(g) After the Board approves a reasonable accommodation, the applicant shall follow
all applicable Land Use Ordinance procedures for the approval of any permits, certificates, or
other approvals required in order to proceed with development or use of the property. All orders,
decisions, determinations, and interpretations made by administrative officers under
those procedures shall be consistent with the reasonable accommodation granted by the

Section 15-103 Evidence.
(a) The provisions of this section apply to all hearings for which a notice is required by

ENFORCEMENT AND REVIEW
Section 15-111 Complaints Regarding Violations.
Whenever the administrator receives a written, signed complaint alleging a violation of this
chapter, he shall investigate the complaint, take whatever action is warranted, and inform the
complainant in writing what actions have been or will be taken.
Section 15-112 Persons Liable.
The owner, tenant, or occupant of any building or land or part thereof and any architect,
builder, contractor, agent or other person who participates in, assists, directs, creates, or maintains
any situation that is contrary to the requirements of this chapter may be held responsible for the
violation and suffer the penalties and be subject to the remedies herein provided.
Section 15-113 Procedures Upon Discovery of Violations.
(a) If the administrator finds that any provision of this chapter is being violated, he shall
send a written notice to the person responsible for such violation, indicating the nature of the
violation and ordering the action necessary to correct it. Additional written notices may be sent at
the administrator’s discretion.
(b) The final written notice (and the initial written notice may be the final notice) shall
state what action the administrator intends to take if the violation is not corrected and shall advise
that the administrator’s decision or order may be appealed to the board of adjustment as provided in
Section 15-91.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in cases when delay would seriously threaten the
effective enforcement of this ordinance or pose a danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, the
administrator may seek enforcement without prior written notice by invoking any of the penalties or
remedies authorized in Section 15-114.
Section 15-114 Penalties and Remedies for Violations.
(a) Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its
requirements, including violations of any conditions and safeguards established in connection with
grants of variances or special use or conditional use permits, and violations of stop work orders,
shall constitute a misdemeanor, punishable as provided in G.S. 14-4. (AMENDED 10/24/89)
(b) Any act constituting a violation of the provisions of this chapter or a failure to
comply with any of its requirements, including violations of any conditions and safeguards
established in connection with the issuance of variances or special use or conditional use permits,
shall also subject the offender to a civil penalty of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00).
Art. VII - ENFORCEMENT AND REVIEW
Page #2
(1) In determining the amount of the civil penalty assessment, the
administrator shall consider the following factors, and the decision levying
a civil penalty shall cite those factors deemed applicable:
a The degree and extent of harm to the natural resources of the town
and its planning jurisdiction, to the public health, or to private
property resulting from the violation;
b The extent to which the violation undermines the regulatory
objectives of the land use ordinance;
c. The duration and gravity of the violation;
d. The cost of rectifying the damage;
e The amount of money saved by noncompliance;
f Whether the violation was committed willfully or intentionally;
negligently; or as the result of an unforeseeable or unavoidable
accident;
g Whether the violator promptly ceased the violation upon notice by
the town and took whatever steps were reasonably possible to limit
or correct any damage caused by the violation;
h. The prior record of the violator in complying or failing to comply
with the provisions of this chapter or any of its requirements,
including violations of any conditions and safeguards established
in connection with the issuance of variances or special use or
conditional use permits;
i. The cost to the town of the enforcement procedures;
j. The scope and the scale of the project where the violation occurs;
k. Whether the civil penalty is levied for a single day’s violation or a
single event or whether it is levied on a daily basis for a continuing
violation, as authorized under subsection (d) below. Civil
penalties levied on a daily basis may cumulatively exceed the
$5,000.00 cap set forth in this subsection.
l. Without limiting the authority of the board of adjustment under
subsection (e), the board of adjustment may affirm a penalty as
imposed, decrease the amount of the penalty, or increase the
amount of the penalty.
Art. VII - ENFORCEMENT AND REVIEW
Page #3
(2) The notice of civil penalty shall inform the violator that the penalty is due
upon receipt of the notification and, if applicable, that successive civil
penalties of a specified amount shall accrue each day that the violation
continues. The notice shall also inform the violator that if the civil penalty
is not paid within ten days of receipt of the notice, the penalty may be
recovered by the town in a civil action in the nature of debt.
(3) A civil penalty may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment in accordance
with Section 15-91 of this chapter, except that such appeal must be filed
within 10 days after receipt by the violator of the notice of civil penalty.
a. An appeal stays further efforts to collect a civil penalty but does
not stay the accrual of daily civil penalties.
b. If a civil penalty is levied for a violation about which the violator
was previously sent a final notice of violation in accordance with
Section 15-113, and the violator did not appeal to the Board of
Adjustment within the prescribed time the administrator’s
determination as to the existence of the violation, an appeal of the
civil penalty under this subsection presents only the issue of
whether the administrator erred in setting the amount of the civil
penalty, not the issue of whether the violation occurred or the
violator’s responsibility for the violation. (AMENDED 06/07/88;
04/23/96)
(c) This chapter may also be enforced by any appropriate equitable action.
(d) Each day’s continuing violation shall be a separate and distinct offense.
(AMENDED 06/07/88; 04/23/96)
(e) Any one, all, or any combination of the foregoing penalties and remedies may be
used to enforce this chapter.
Section 15-115 Permit Revocation and Building Permit Denial (AMENDED 10/24/06).
(a) A zoning, sign, special use, or conditional use permit may be revoked by the
permit-issuing authority (in accordance with the provisions of this section) if the permit recipient
fails to develop or maintain the property in accordance with the plans submitted, the requirements
of this chapter, or any additional requirements lawfully imposed by the permit issuing board.
(b) Before a conditional use or special use permit may be revoked, all of the notice and
hearing and other requirements of Article VI shall be complied with. The notice shall inform the
permit recipient of the alleged grounds for the revocation.
Art. VII - ENFORCEMENT AND REVIEW
Page #4
(1) The burden of presenting evidence sufficient to authorize the permit-issuing
authority to conclude that a permit should be revoked for any of the reasons
set forth in subsection (a) shall be upon the party advocating that position.
The burden of persuasion shall also be upon that party. (AMENDED
11/10/81)
(2) A motion to revoke a permit shall include, insofar as practicable, a statement
of the specific reasons or findings of fact that support the motion.
(c) Before a zoning or sign permit may be revoked, the administrator shall give the
permit recipient ten days notice of intent to revoke the permit and shall inform the recipient of the
alleged reasons for the revocation and of his right to obtain an informal hearing on the allegations.
If the permit is revoked, the administrator shall provide to the permittee a written statement of the
decision and the reasons therefor.
(d) No person may continue to make use of land or buildings in the manner authorized
by any zoning, sign, special use or conditional use permit after such permit has been revoked in
accordance with this section.
(e) Building permits required pursuant to G.S. 160A-417 may be denied for lots that have
been illegally subdivided. No building permit may be denied, however, if the permit applicant
can show that he purchased the lot in good faith (i.e. he did not know and had no reasonable way
of knowing that the lot was illegally subdivided) and for value. (AMENDED 10/24/06)
Section 15-116 Judicial Review (AMENDED 4/27/82; 10/21/14)

court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari pursuant to G.S. 160A-393. A petition for
review shall be filed with the clerk of superior court by the later of 30 days after the
decision is filed in the planning department or after a written copy thereof is delivered as
provided in Subsection 15-106(b). When first-class mail is used to deliver notice, three days
shall be added to the time to file the petition.
(b) A copy of the writ of certiorari shall be served upon the Town of Carrboro.
Section 15-117 Stop Work Orders. (AMENDED 10/24/89)
(a) Whenever the land use administrator determines that a person is engaged in doing
work that constitutes, creates, or results in a violation of this chapter and that irreparable injury will
occur if the violation is not terminated immediately, the administrator may order the specific part of
the work that constitutes, creates, or results in a violation of this chapter to be immediately stopped.
(b) A stop work order issued under this section shall be in writing, directed to the
person doing the work and shall state the specific work to be stopped, the specific reasons therefor,
and the conditions under which the work may be resumed. A copy of the stop work order shall also
Art. VII - ENFORCEMENT AND REVIEW

be sent forthwith to the owner of the property where the work is taking place and the developer, if
different from the owner.
(c) Any person aggrieved by the issuance of a stop work order may appeal the issuance
of the order to the Carrboro Board of Adjustment pursuant to Section 15-91 of this chapter.
However, notwithstanding subsection 15-91(d), an appeal shall not stay the operation of the stop
work order except as provided in subsection (d) of this section.
(d) The board of adjustment shall meet and act upon the appeal within 15 working days
after receipt of the appeal notice. If the board fails to comply with this requirement, the stop work
order shall be stayed automatically beginning on the day following the expiration of this
15-working-day period, and the stay shall remain in effect until the board of adjustment meets and
acts on the appeal.
(e) The notice of hearing requirements set forth in Section 15-102 shall not apply to
appeals of stop work orders. However, the staff shall orally notify the appellant of the date, time,
and place of the hearing as soon as it has been scheduled and shall send to the appellant a written
confirmation of this notice as soon as possible.
(f) Neither the person whom a stop work order is served nor an owner or developer
served with a copy under subsection (b) may thereafter cause, suffer, or permit a violation of the
order while it remains in effect, except during a period in which the operation of the order is stayed
under subsection (d).

ARTICLE VIII
NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
Section 15-121 Definitions.
Unless otherwise specifically provided or unless clearly required by the context, the words
and phrases defined in this section shall have the meaning indicated when used in this article.
(1) DIMENSIONAL NONCONFORMITY. A nonconforming situation that occurs when
the height, size, or minimum floor space of a structure or the relationship between
an existing building or buildings and other buildings or lot lines does not conform to
the regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located.
(2) EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS CHAPTER. Whenever this article refers to the effective
date of this chapter, the reference shall be deemed to include the effective date of
any amendments to this chapter if the amendment, rather than this chapter as
originally adopted, creates a nonconforming situation.
(3) EXPENDITURE. A sum of money paid out in return for some benefit or to fulfill
some obligation. The term also includes binding contractual commitments to make
future expenditures, as well as any other substantial changes in position.
(4) NONCONFORMING LOT. A lot existing at the effective date of this chapter (and
not created for the purposes of evading the restrictions of this chapter) that does not
meet the minimum area requirement of the district in which the lot is located.
(5) NONCONFORMING PROJECT. Any structure, development, or undertaking that is
incomplete at the effective date of this chapter and would be inconsistent with any
regulation applicable to the district in which it is located if completed as proposed or
planned.
(6) NONCONFORMING SIGN. A sign (see Section 15-270 for definition) that, on the
effective date of this chapter does not conform to one or more of the regulations set
forth in this chapter, particularly Article XVII, Signs.
(7) NONCONFORMING SITUATION. A situation that occurs when, on the effective
date of this chapter, an existing lot or structure does not conform to one or more of
the regulations applicable to the district in which the lot or structure is located.
Among other possibilities, a nonconforming situation may arise because a lot does
not meet minimum acreage requirements, because structures exceed maximum
height limitations, because the relationship between existing buildings and the land
(in such matters as density and setback requirements) is not in conformity with this
Art. VIII - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
Page #2
chapter, because signs do not meet the requirements of Article XVII of this chapter,
or because land or buildings are used for purposes made unlawful by this chapter.
(8) NONCONFORMING USE. A nonconforming use that occurs when property is used
for a purpose or in a manner made unlawful by the use regulations applicable to the
district in which the property is located. (For example, a commercial office building
in a residential district may be a nonconforming use.) The term also refers to the
activity that constitutes the use made of the property. (For example, all the activity
associated with running a bakery in a residentially zoned area is a nonconforming
use.)
Section 15-122 Continuation of Nonconforming Situations and Completion of
Nonconforming Projects.
(a) Nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this
chapter may be continued, subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in Section 15-123
through 15-129.
(b) Nonconforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the provisions
of Section 15-128.
Section 15-123 Nonconforming Lots.
(a) When a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations
applicable to the intended use, except that the lot is smaller than the required minimums set forth in
Section 15-181, then the lot may be used as proposed just as if it were conforming. However, no
use (e.g., a duplex) that requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size for a
particular zone is permissible on a nonconforming lot.
(b) When the use proposed for a nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all
other respects but the applicable setback requirements (Section 15-184) cannot reasonably be
complied with, then the entity authorized by this chapter to issue a permit for the proposed use (the
administrator, board of adjustment, or Board of Aldermen) may allow deviations from the
applicable setback requirements if it finds that:
(1) The property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed without
such deviations;
(2) These deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming
lot; and
(3) The property can be developed as proposed without any significantly
adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety.
Art. VIII - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
Page #3
(c) For purposes of subsection (b), compliance with applicable building setback
requirements is not reasonably possible if a building that serves the minimal needs of the use
proposed for the nonconforming lot cannot practicably be constructed and located on the lot in
conformity with such setback requirements. However, mere financial hardship does not constitute
grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible.
(d) This section applies only to undeveloped nonconforming lots. A lot is undeveloped
if it has no substantial structures upon it. A change in use of a developed nonconforming lot may
be accomplished in accordance with Section 15-126.
(e) Subject to the following sentence, if, on the date this section becomes effective, an
undeveloped nonconforming lot adjoins and has continuous frontage with one or more other
undeveloped lots under the same ownership, then neither the owner of the nonconforming lot nor
his successors in interest may take advantage of the provisions of this section. This subsection shall
not apply to a nonconforming lot if a majority of the developed lots located on either side of the
street where such lot is located and within 500 feet of such lot are also nonconforming. The intent
of this subsection is to require nonconforming lots to be combined with other undeveloped lots to
create conforming lots under the circumstances specified herein, but not to require such
combination when that would be out of character with the way the neighborhood has previously
been developed.
Section 15-124 Extension or Enlargement of Nonconforming Situations.
(a) Except as specifically provided in this section, no person may engage in any activity
that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation. In particular,
physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if such
activity results in:
(1) An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use; or
(2) Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as
setback requirements, height limitations or density requirements or other
requirements such as parking requirements.
(b) Subject to subsection (d) a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any
portion of a completed building that, when the use was made nonconforming by this chapter, was
manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use. However, subject to Section 15-128
(authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain circumstances), a nonconforming
use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building.
(c) Subject to Section 15-128 (authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in
certain circumstances), a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land
than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming, except that a use that involves the
removal of natural materials from the lot (e.g., a quarry) may be expanded to the boundaries of the
Art. VIII - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
Page #4
lot where the use was established at the time it became nonconforming if ten percent or more of the
earth products had already been removed at the effective date of this chapter.
(d) The volume, intensity, or frequency of use or property where a nonconforming
situation exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a
nonconforming situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes
in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind and no violations of other paragraphs of this
section occur.
(e) Notwithstanding subsection (a), when one single-family detached residence is
located on a lot and that residence (i) constitutes a non-conforming use where it is located, or (ii) is
located on a lot that is nonconforming in terms of size, or (iii) is non-conforming with respect to the
dimensional or parking requirements of this chapter, then such single-family residence may be
enlarged or replaced with another single-family residence of a larger size, so long as:
(Amended 5/21/02)
(1) The enlargement or replacement does not create new non-conformities or
increase the extent of existing non-conformities with respect to dimensional,
parking or other requirements; and
(2) The enlarged or replacement house does not contain more than three
bedrooms, or the number of bedrooms of the original house, whichever is
greater; and
(3) The square footage of heated floor space within the enlarged or replacement
house does not exceed that of the original house by more than 50% or 500
square feet, whichever is greater; and
(4) If the original house is replaced, the original house is removed from the lot.
(e1) Notwithstanding subsection (a), when more than one single-family residences are
located on a single lot, and such structures (i) constitute non-conforming uses where they are
located, or (ii) are located on a lot that is nonconforming in terms of size or density, or (iii) are nonconforming
with respect to the dimensional or parking requirements of this chapter, any of such
residential structures may be enlarged or replaced with another single-family residential structure of
a larger size, so long as: (Amended 5/21/02)
(1) The enlargement or replacement does not create new non-conformities or
increase the extent of existing non-conformities with respect to
dimensional, parking or other requirements; and
(2) The enlarged or replacement house does not contain more than three
bedrooms, or the number of bedrooms of the original house, whichever is
greater; and
Art. VIII - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
Page #5
(3) The square footage of heated floor space within the enlarged or replacement
house does not exceed that of the original house by more than 50% or 500
square feet, whichever is greater; and
(4) If the original house is replaced, the original house is removed from the lot.
(f) Notwithstanding subsection (a), whenever: (i) there exists a lot with one or more
structures on it; and (ii) a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is
proposed for such lot; and (iii) the parking requirements of Article XVIII that would be applicable
as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area
available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking, then the proposed use shall not be
regarded as resulting in an impermissible extension or enlargement of a nonconforming situation.
However, the applicant shall be required to comply with all applicable parking requirements that
can be satisfied without acquiring additional land, and shall also be required to obtain satellite
parking in accordance with Section 15-297 if: (i) parking requirements cannot be satisfied on the lot
with respect to which the permit is required; and (ii) such satellite parking is reasonably available.
If such satellite parking is not reasonably available at the time the zoning or special or conditional
use permit is granted, then the permit recipient shall be required to obtain it if and when it does
become reasonably available. This requirement shall be a continuing condition of the permit.
(g) A nonconforming use that operates within an enclosed building may expand one
time by enlarging the building within which the use is conducted or by expanding within a building
where an extension is not otherwise allowed under subsection (b), so long as: (AMENDED
6/15/86)
(1) The area of the enlargement of the nonconforming use does not exceed the
maximums established below:
a. If the gross floor area previously occupied by the nonconforming use
does not exceed 1,000 square feet, then the maximum expansion
shall be equal to 100% of the gross floor area previously occupied by
the nonconforming use.
b. If the gross floor area previously occupied by the nonconforming use
is between 1,001 and 5,000 square feet, then the maximum
expansion shall be equal to 1,000 square feet plus 35% of the
difference between the gross floor area previously occupied by the
nonconforming use and 1,000 square feet.
c. If the gross floor area previously occupied by the nonconforming use
exceeds 5,000 square feet, then the maximum expansion shall be
equal to 2,400 square feet plus 25% of the difference between the
gross floor area previously occupied by the nonconforming use and
5,000 square feet. However, in no case may the gross floor area of
the expansion exceed 5,000 square feet.
Art. VIII - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
Page #6
(2) No additional outside storage is associated with the expansion; and
(3) The nonconforming use, when expanded, does not generate noise that tends
to have an annoying or disruptive effect upon (i) uses located outside the
immediate space occupied by the nonconforming use if that is one of several
located on a lot; or (ii) uses located on adjacent lots; and
(4) At least “B” level screening is provided in conjunction with the expansion
(“A” level screening shall be provided if required under Article XIX); and
(5) The expansion does not involve the addition of any new drive-in windows;
and
(6) A permit authorizing the expansion is issued by the board of adjustment,
unless the expansion is proposed in connection with a development that
otherwise requires a conditional use permit, in which case the permit must
be issued by the Board of Aldermen. Such a permit may be issued only if
the board finds that the proposed expansion satisfies the foregoing
requirements and that:
a. All of the applicable requirements of this chapter that can reasonably
be complied with will be complied with. Compliance with a
requirement of this chapter is not reasonably possible if compliance
cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where
the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial
structure that is on a permanent foundation. Mere financial hardship
caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking
does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not
reasonably possible. And in no case may an applicant be given
permission pursuant to this subsection to construct a building or add
to an existing building if additional dimensional nonconformities
(including parking nonconformities) would thereby be created; and
b. On balance, the benefits to the neighborhood that result from the
improvements required under this subsection in conjunction with the
expansion of a nonconforming use outweigh the disadvantages
inherent in the expansion of a nonconforming use.
(h) Notwithstanding subsection (a), an expansion of a building intended to be used for
the provision of emergency services (use classification 13.000) which is nonconforming with
respect to setback requirements, whereby the expanded building will be no closer than the existing
building to the lot line or the street right-of-way line or centerline with respect to which the existing
building is nonconforming, shall not constitute an increase in the extent of nonconformity or a
nonconforming situation, provided that to take advantage of this provision, the permit required for
Art. VIII - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
Page #7
the expansion shall be a conditional use permit notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the table
of permissible uses. (AMENDED 06/07/88)
Section 15-125 Repair, Maintenance and Reconstruction.
(a) Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming
situations exist are permitted and encouraged. Major renovation, i.e., work estimated to cost more
than twenty-five percent of the appraised valuation of the structure to be renovated may be done
only in accordance with a zoning permit issued pursuant to this section.
(b) If a structure located on a lot where a nonconforming situation exists is damaged to
an extent that the costs of repair or replacement would exceed twenty-five percent of the appraised
valuation of the damaged structure, then the damaged structure may be repaired or replaced only in
accordance with a zoning permit issued pursuant to this section. This subsection does not apply to
structures used for single-family residential purposes, which structures may be reconstructed
pursuant to a zoning permit just as they may be enlarged or replaced as provided in subsection
15-124(e).
(c) For purposes of subsections (a) and (b):
(1) The “cost” of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the fair market
value of the materials and services necessary to accomplish such renovation,
repair, or replacement.
(2) The “cost” of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the total cost of
all such intended work, and no person may seek to avoid the intent of
subsection (a) or (b) by doing such work incrementally.
(3) The “appraised valuation” shall mean either the appraised valuation for
property tax purposes, updated as necessary by the increase in the consumer
price index since the date of the last valuation, or the valuation determined
by a professionally recognized property appraiser.
(d) The administrator shall issue a permit authorized by this section if he finds that, in
completing the renovation, repair or replacement work:
(1) No violation of Section 15-124 will occur; and
(2) The permittee will comply to the extent reasonably possible with all
provisions of this chapter applicable to the existing use, (except that the
permittee shall not lose his right to continue a nonconforming use or a
nonconforming level of residential density). (AMENDED 11/26/85)
Compliance with a requirement of this chapter is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be
achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained
Art. VIII - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
Page #8
or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation. Mere financial hardship caused
by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding
that compliance is not reasonably possible.
Section 15-126 Change In Use of Property Where a Nonconforming Situation Exists.
(a) A change in the use of property (where a nonconforming situation exists) that is
sufficiently substantial to require a new zoning, special use, or conditional use permit in accordance
with Section 15-46 may not be made except in accordance with subsection (b) through (d).
However, this requirement shall not apply if only a sign permit is needed. (AMENDED 4/27/82)
(b) If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district
where the property is located, and all of the other requirements of this chapter applicable to that use
can be complied with, permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner as
permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot. Once conformity with this chapter is achieved,
the property may not revert to its nonconforming status.
(c) If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district
where the property is located, but all of the requirements of this chapter applicable to that use
cannot reasonably be complied with, then the change is permissible, if the entity authorized by
this chapter to issue a permit for that particular use (the administrator, board of adjustment, or
Board of Aldermen) issues a permit authorizing the change. This permit may be issued if the
permit-issuing authority finds, in addition to any other findings that may be required by this
chapter, that:
(1) The intended change will not result in a violation of Section 15-124; and
(2) All of the applicable requirements of this chapter that can reasonably be
complied with will be complied with. Compliance with a requirement of this chapter
is not reasonably possible if, among other reasons, compliance cannot be achieved
without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is
maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation. Mere
financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking
does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible.
However, the permit-issuing authority may conclude that compliance is not
reasonably possible if the cost (financial and otherwise) of compliance is substantially
disproportional to the benefits of eliminating a nonconformity. In no case may an
applicant be given permission pursuant to this subsection to construct a building or
add to an existing building if additional nonconformities would thereby be created.
(AMENDED 5/25/04)
(d) If the intended change in use is to another principal use that is also nonconforming,
then the change is permissible if the entity authorized by this chapter to issue a permit for that
particular use (administrator, board of adjustment, or Board of Aldermen) issues a permit
Art. VIII - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
Page #9
authorizing the change. The permit-issuing authority may issue the permit if it finds, in addition to
other findings that may be required by this chapter, that:
(1) The use requested is one that is permissible in some zoning district with
either a zoning, special use, or conditional use permit; and
(2) All of the conditions applicable to the permit authorized in subsection (c) of
this section are satisfied; and
(3) The proposed development will have less of an adverse impact on those
most affected by it and will be more compatible with the surrounding
neighborhood than the use in operation at the time the permit is applied for.
Section 15-127 Abandonment and Discontinuance of Nonconforming Situations.
(AMENDED 06/18/91)
(a) When a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of at least twelve
consecutive months, the property may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes, except as
provided in subsection (b).
(b) When a nonconforming use has been discontinued for a consecutive period of at
least twelve months, then the property may thereafter be re-used for a use within the same principal
use classification as the most recently discontinued nonconforming use if the permit-issuing
authority issues a permit authorizing the change. As used in this subsection, the term
permit-issuing authority means the Board of Aldermen, if the use proposed would require a
conditional use permit in any zoning district where such use is permissible, and otherwise means
the board of adjustment. The permit issuing authority may issue the permit if it finds, in addition to
other findings that may be required by this chapter, that:
(1) All of the conditions applicable to the permit authorized in subsection
15-126(c) are satisfied; and
(2) The property where the nonconforming use is proposed to be reinstated is
particularly well adapted (in terms of the nature and orientation of
improvements on that property) to that nonconforming use, and it would be
substantially difficult or impractical to use this property for conforming
purposes; and
(3) Reinstatement of the nonconforming use will not have a substantially
adverse effect on the public health or safety or the value, use, or enjoyment
of properties in the immediate area of the nonconforming use; and
(4) Since the nonconforming use was discontinued, the property has not been
used for conforming purposes for more than a continuous period of three
months.
Art. VIII - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
Page #10
(c) If the principal activity on the property where a nonconforming situation other than
a nonconforming use exists is discontinued for a consecutive period of at least twelve months, then
that property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the
pre-existing use unless the entity with authority to issue a permit for the intended use issues a
permit to allow the property to be used for this purpose without correcting the nonconforming
situations. This permit may be issued if the permit-issuing authority finds that eliminating a
particular nonconformity is not reasonably possible (i.e., cannot be accomplished without adding
additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial
structure that is on a permanent foundation). The permit shall specify which nonconformity need
not be corrected.
(d) For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation
is lost pursuant to this section, all of the buildings, activities, and operations maintained on a lot are
generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one apartment in a
nonconforming apartment building for twelve months shall not result in a loss of the right to rent
that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously
maintained. But if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use,
discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain
it thereafter [subject to subsection (b)].
(e) When a structure or operation made nonconforming by this chapter is vacant or
discontinued at the effective date of this chapter, the twelve month period for purposes of this
section begins to run at the effective date of this chapter.
Section 15-128 Completion of Nonconforming Projects.
(a) All nonconforming projects on which construction was begun at least 180 days
before the effective date of this chapter as well as all nonconforming projects that are at least
twenty-five percent completed in terms of the total expected cost of the project on the effective date
of this chapter may be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits, so long as these
permits were validly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired. If a development is designed to
be completed in stages, this subsection shall apply only to the particular phase under construction.
(b) Except as provided in subsection (a), and except to the extent that a developer has a
vested right as set forth in Sections 15-128.2 and 15-128.3, all work on any nonconforming project
shall cease on the effective date of this chapter, and all permits previously issued for work on
nonconforming projects shall be revoked as of that date. The permit-issuing authority shall issue
such a permit if it finds that the applicant has in good faith made substantial expenditures or
incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changes his position in some substantial way
in reasonable reliance on the land use law as it existed before the effective date of this chapter and
thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete his project as proposed. In
considering whether these findings may be made, the permit-issuing authority shall be guided by
the following, as well as other relevant considerations: (AMENDED 11/10/81; 10/01/91)
Art. VIII - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
Page #11
(1) All expenditures made to obtain or pursuant to a building, zoning, sign, or
special or conditional use permit that was validly issued and that remains
unrevoked shall be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land
use law that existed before this chapter became effective. (AMENDED
4/27/82)
(2) Except as provided in subdivision (b)(1), no expenditures made more than
180 days before the effective date of this chapter may be considered as
evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this
chapter became effective. An expenditure is made at the time a party incurs
a binding obligation to make that expenditure.
(3) To the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort, a
party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made those expenditures.
For example, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having
made some expenditures to acquire a potential development site if the
property obtained is approximately as valuable under the new classification
as it was under the old, for the expenditure can be recovered by a resale of
the property.
(4) To the extent that a nonconforming project can be made conforming and that
expenditures made or obligations incurred can be effectively utilized in the
completion of a conforming project, a party shall not be considered
prejudiced by having made such expenditures.
(5) An expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is significant both in
dollar amount and in terms of (i) the total estimated costs of the proposed
project, and (ii) the ordinary business practices of the developer.
(6) A person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if actual knowledge
of a proposed change in the land use law affecting the proposed
development site could not be attributed to him.
(7) Even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the
land use law affecting a development site, the permit-issuing authority may
still find that he acted in good faith if he did not proceed with his plans in a
deliberate attempt to circumvent the effects of the proposed ordinance. The
permit-issuing authority may find that the developer did not proceed in an
attempt to undermine the proposed ordinance if it determines that (i) at the
time the expenditures were made, either there was considerable doubt about
whether any ordinance would ultimately be passed, or it was not clear that
the proposed ordinance would prohibit the intended development, and (ii)
the developer had legitimate business reasons for making expenditures.
Art. VIII - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
Page #12
(8) In deciding whether a permit should be issued under this section, the permit
issuing authority shall not be limited to either denying a permit altogether or
issuing a permit to complete the project (or phases, sections, or stages
thereof) as originally proposed or approved. Upon proper submission of
plans by the applicant, the permit issuing authority may also issue a permit
authorizing a development that is less nonconforming than the project as
originally proposed or approved but that still does not comply with all the
provisions of the ordinance making the project nonconforming.
(AMENDED 10/01/91)
(c) When it appears from the developer's plans or otherwise that a project was intended
to be or reasonably could be completed in phases, stages, segments, or other discrete units, the
developer shall be allowed to complete only those phases or segments with respect to which the
developer can make the showing required under subsection (b). In addition to the matters and
subject to the guidelines set forth in subdivisions (1) through (8) of subsection (b), the permit
issuing authority shall, in determining whether a developer would be unreasonably prejudiced if not
allowed to complete phases or segments of a nonconforming project, consider the following in
addition to other relevant factors:
(1) Whether any plans prepared or approved regarding incompleted phases
constitute conceptual plans only or construction drawings based upon
detailed surveying, architectural, or engineering work.
(2) Whether any improvements, such as streets or utilities, have been installed
in phases not yet completed.
(3) Whether utilities and other facilities installed in completed phases have been
constructed in such a manner or location or on such a scale, in anticipation
of connection to or interrelationship with approved but incompleted phases,
that the investment in such utilities or other facilities cannot be recouped if
such approved but incompleted phases are constructed in conformity with
existing regulations.
(AMENDED 10/01/91)
(d) The permit-issuing authority shall not consider any application for the permit
authorized by subsection (b) that is submitted more than sixty days after the effective date of this
chapter. The permit-issuing authority may waive this requirement for good cause shown, but in no
case may it extend the application deadline beyond one year.
(e) The administrator shall send copies of this section to the persons listed as owners for
tax purposes (and developers, if different from the owners) of all properties in regard to which
permits have been issued for nonconforming projects or in regard to which a nonconforming project
is otherwise known to be in some stage of development. This notice shall be sent by certified mail
not less than fifteen days before the effective date of this chapter.
Art. VIII - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
Page #13
(f) The permit-issuing authority shall establish expedited procedures for hearing
applications for permits under this section. These applications shall be heard, whenever possible,
before the effective date of this chapter, so that construction work is not needlessly interrupted.
(g) When it appears from the developer's plans or otherwise that the nonconforming
project was intended to be or reasonably could be completed in stages, segments, or other discrete
units, the permit-issuing authority shall not allow the nonconforming project to be constructed or
completed in a fashion that is larger or more extensive than is necessary to allow the developer to
recoup and obtain a reasonable rate of return on the expenditures he has made in connection with
that nonconforming project. (REPEALED 10/01/91; AMENDED 10/01/91)
Section 15-128.1 Authorization of Nonconforming Projects (AMENDED 10/01/91)
Whenever an amendment to this chapter becomes effective after an application for a
development permit is submitted but before the permit is issued, and the effect of the amendment is
to render the proposed development nonconforming in some respect, then the permit issuing
authority may nevertheless issue the permit even though the project is nonconforming if it finds that
the applicant has in good faith made substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding
obligations or otherwise changed his position in some substantial way in reasonable reliance on this
chapter as it existed prior to the amendment and thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if
required to comply with this chapter as so amended.
Section 15-128.2 Vested Rights: Site Specific Development Plan (AMENDED 10/01/91)
(a) The Board determines that a special use permit or a conditional use permit shall be
regarded as a “site specific development plan” under the provisions of G.S. 160A-385.1. Therefore,
once a special use permit or conditional use permit has been issued, the permit recipient shall have
a “vested right” to complete the development authorized by such permit in accordance with its
terms, irrespective of subsequent amendments to this chapter, to the extent provided in G.S.
160A-385.1.
(b) The Board further determines that recipients of zoning permits should be entitled to
the same protections as recipients of special or conditional use permits. Therefore, subject to
Subsection 15-148(b), once a zoning permit has been issued, the permit recipient shall have a
“vested right” to complete the development authorized by such permit in accordance with its terms,
irrespective of subsequent amendments to this chapter, to the same extent provided in G.S.
160A-385.1 for developments authorized by the approval of “site specific development plans.”
(c) A vested right under this section commences upon the issuance of the permit in
question, and the date of issuance is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of
Subsection 15-62(d).
(1) A zoning right that has been vested as provided in this chapter shall remain
vested for a period of two years. This vesting shall not be extended by any
amendments or modifications to a site specific development plan (that are
Art. VIII - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
Page #14
not processed as new applications - - see Section 15-64), unless expressly
provided by the approval authority at the time the amendment or
modification is approved.
(2) As provided in G.S. 160A-385.1(d)(6), a right which has been vested in
accordance with this section shall terminate at the end of the applicable
vesting period with respect to buildings and uses for which no valid building
permit applications have been filed.
(d) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the revocation of a permit pursuant to Section
15-115, and the vesting of rights provided for under this section shall be terminated upon such
revocation.
(e) The effect of this section is to ensure that, during the period of vesting, the
developer is protected from subsequent changes in this ordinance to a greater extent than is
authorized under Section 15-128.3 (which provides for a vesting of rights only after a building
permit has been obtained), or Section 15-128 (which generally provides for a vesting of rights only
after the developer has made substantial expenditures in good faith reliance upon this chapter).
Section 15-128.3 Vested Rights Upon Issuance of Building Permits (AMENDED 10/01/91)
As provided in G.S. 160A-385, amendments, modifications, supplements, repeal or other
changes in the zoning regulations set forth in this chapter or zoning district boundaries shall not be
applicable or enforceable without consent of the owner with respect to buildings and uses for which
a building permit has been issued pursuant to G.S. 160A-417 prior to the enactment of the
ordinance making the change or changes, so long as the permit remains valid and unexpired
pursuant to G.S. 160A-418 and unrevoked pursuant to G.S. 160A-422.
Section 15-129 Nonconforming Signs.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, a nonconforming sign that
exceeds the height or size limitations of Article XVII by more than ten percent or that is
nonconforming in some other way shall, within three years following the effective date of this
chapter, or two years after notification, whichever is sooner, be altered to comply with the
provisions of this chapter (particularly Article XVII) or be removed. If the nonconformity consists
of too many freestanding signs or an excess of total sign area, the person responsible for the
violation may determine which sign or signs need to be altered or removed by bringing the
development into conformity with the provisions of Article XVII.
(b) Within nine months after the effective date of this chapter, the administrator shall
make every reasonable effort to identify all the nonconforming signs within the town's planning
jurisdiction. He shall then contact the person responsible for each such sign (as well as the owner
of the property where the nonconforming sign is located, if different from the former) and inform
such person (i) that the sign is nonconforming, (ii) how it is nonconforming, (iii) what must be done
to correct it and by what date, and (iv) the consequences of failure to make the necessary
Art. VIII - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
Page #15
corrections. The administrator shall keep complete records of all correspondence, communications,
and other actions taken with respect to such nonconforming signs.
(c) This section applies to all signs, including off-premises signs.
Section 15-130 Nonconforming Mobile Home Communities. (AMENDED 10/20/87)
(a) Existing mobile home communities (use classifications 1.122 or 1.123) that do not
meet all of the standards for such a use that are set forth elsewhere in this ordinance at the time of
adoption of this section shall be considered nonconforming. Such uses shall not expand in any way
beyond the existing developed areas, but shall be allowed to remove and replace the units on spaces
existing within the existing community at the time of adoption of this section.
(b) Only the replacement and location of units on an existing mobile home space shall
be permitted, provided that the total number of units does not exceed the number existing at the
time of adoption of this section; and provided that the existing waste treatment system is
functioning properly. Removal and replacement of such units shall not be considered expansion of
the nonconforming use.
(c) Any mobile home unit replacing an existing mobile home unit on an existing home
space, pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) above, and not previously located within the mobile home
community, must be a Class A or Class B mobile home as defined in Article II of this ordinance.

ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
PART I. ZONING DISTRICTS
Section 15-135 Residential Districts Established.
(a) The following basic residential districts are hereby established: R-20, R-15, R-10,
R-7.5, R-3, R-2, R-R, R-S.I.R., and R-S.I.R.-2. The purpose of each of the foregoing residential
districts is to secure for the persons who reside there a comfortable, healthy, safe, and pleasant
environment in which to live, sheltered from incompatible and disruptive activities that properly
belong in non-residential districts. (AMENDED 5/12/81; 12/7/83; 2/4/86)
(b) The WR (watershed residential) district is also established. All land within this
district is located within the University Lake Watershed, and while this district is designed to
achieve the objectives identified in subsection (a), it is also intended to protect the community water
supply by allowing residential development of the land within the University Lake Watershed only
at reduced density levels. (AMENDED 12/7/83; 05/15/90)
(c) The R-R (rural residential) district is designed to accommodate the residential and
related uses as well as several additional uses that would be appropriate in the more sparsely
populated areas of the town’s joint planning transition area or extraterritorial planning area, but that
would be inappropriate within the more intensively developed residential zones. (AMENDED
11/14/88)
(d) The R-S.I.R. (suitable for intensive residential) zone is designed (i) to encourage
high density residential development that is compatible with the housing element of the town’s
Comprehensive Land Use Plan, and (ii) to locate this high density development in areas most
suitable for it, thereby reducing pressure for growth in less desirable locations and reducing urban
sprawl. Land in this zone is deemed especially suitable for intensive residential development
because of (i) the availability of police, fire, and sanitation service at low marginal cost due to
existing service patterns, (ii) the availability of public water and sewer service, (iii) the ample road
system serving the area, (iv) the compatibility of existing development in the area with high density
residential development, and (v) the compatibility of high density residential development with
environmental concerns, especially water quality. Developers are encouraged to construct housing
that is consistent with the town’s housing objectives through density bonuses, as set forth in Section
15-182.1.
(e) The R-S.I.R.-2 zoning district is designed to serve essentially the same purposes as
the R-S.I.R. zone, but the maximum density allowed in the R-S.I.R.-2 district is less than that
permitted in the R-S.I.R. district (see Section 15-182.1). Except as otherwise specifically provided
in this chapter, all regulations and standards applicable to the R-S.I.R. district are also applicable to
the R-S.I.R.-2 district. (AMENDED 11/10/81)
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #2
(f) REPEALED 12/7/83
Section 15-135.1 Conservation District (AMENDED 12/7/83).
There is hereby established a conservation (C) district. The purpose of this district is to
protect the public health, safety, and welfare by severely restricting development within and
adjacent to certain lakes, ponds, watercourses, streams, creeks, drainage areas, floodplains,
wetlands, and other flood-prone areas within the University Lake Watershed. The limited
development allowed within a conservation district not only minimizes the danger to the
community water supply from the more intensive development of this land but also allows this land
to act as a natural buffer between more intensively developed areas and the watercourses contained
within a conservation district. (AMENDED 12/7/83)
Section 15-136 Commercial Districts Established (AMENDED 02/4/86; 05/28/02).
The districts described below are hereby created to accomplish the purposes and serve the
objectives indicated:
(1) B-1(C) TOWN CENTER BUSINESS. This district is designed to encourage and
accommodate a unified, compact, contiguous shopping and entertainment area
focused around restaurants, specialty shops, arts and crafts. This area is intended for
development around a theme or themes consistent with the Carr Mill, The Station,
and historic or old Carrboro. The area is intended to accommodate the pedestrian
user. (AMENDED 06/09/98)
(2) B-1(G) GENERAL BUSINESS. This district is designed to accommodate a broad
range of business uses. This district, because of its close proximity to established
residential single family neighborhoods, is limited in the types of night uses
permitted. Uses may be restricted in the hours of operation where the permit-issuing
authority finds that such restrictions are necessary to prevent unreasonable
disruptions to the peace and quiet of a nearby residential area. (AMENDED
12/08/92; 06/09/98; 06/20/06)
(2.1) (EAT) RESTAURANT DISTRICT OVERLAY. This overlay district is designed to
accommodate on-premises (inside and outside) dining 8.100 and 8.200 restaurant
uses in the B-1(g) General Business district. Because of the B-1(g) district’s close
proximity to established residential single-family neighborhoods, the EAT overlay
is restricted to properties a minimum distance of one property width from abutting
residential zones and is limited in the types of night uses permitted. In addition,
emphasis is given to the existing restrictions in the B-1(g) district and the ability
of the permit-issuing authority to limit hours of operation where such restrictions
are necessary to prevent unreasonable disruptions to the peace and quiet of a
nearby residential area. Use of property within the overlay district for 8.100 and
8.200 purposes shall require the issuance of a conditional use permit.
(AMENDED 03/21/95)
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #3
(3) B-2 FRINGE COMMERCIAL. This district is a transitional district which is designed
to accommodate commercial uses in areas that formerly were residential but that
now may be more desirable for commercial activities due to high traffic volumes
and proximity to other nonresidential districts. At the same time, continued
residential use of existing and nearby structures, and preservation of the existing
character and appearance of this area is encouraged. Accordingly, however,
whenever the use of the land in this district is changed to commercial, it is intended
and desired that existing residential structures be converted and adapted to
commercial use rather than new buildings constructed, and to encourage this, the
regulations for this district allow development at a lower density than is permitted in
the B-1 districts and permit uses that tend to generate minimal traffic. In this way,
the B-2 district should provide a smoother transition from the more intensively
developed B-1 areas to residential areas. Any development within the B-2 district
shall comply with the following requirements: (AMENDED 09/06/88; 06/20/06).
a. To the extent practicable, development shall otherwise retain, preserve and
be compatible with the residential character of the older homes within and
immediately adjacent to this district;
b. To the extent practicable, vehicle accommodation areas associated with uses
on lots in this district shall be located in the rear of buildings so that parking
areas are not readily visible from the streets; and
(4) B-3 NEIGHBORHOOD BUSINESS. This district is designed to accommodate
commercial needs arising at the neighborhood level, such as grocery stores,
branch banks, gas sales, and the like, as well as other commercial and office uses
that are of such size and scale that they can compatibly coexist with adjoining
residential neighborhoods. To insure compatibility between B-3 areas and the
neighborhoods, no B-3 district shall be greater than five acres, and no areas shall
be zoned B-3 if any portion of a pre-existing business district lies within one-half
mile in any direction. (AMENDED 3/7/2006)
(5) B-4 OUTLYING CONCENTRATED BUSINESS. This zone is designed to
accommodate a variety of commercial enterprises that provide goods and services to
a larger market area than those businesses permitted in the neighborhood business
district. Development regulations also permit higher buildings and increased
density over that allowed in the B-3 zone. This zone is intended to create an
attractive, concentrated business district in areas that are outside the town’s central
business district but that are served by the town’s major thoroughfares. Examples of
permitted uses include shopping centers, professional offices and motels. Uses that
are not permitted include outside storage and drive-in theaters.
(6) B-5 WATERSHED COMMERCIAL. This district is designed to accommodate
commercial uses within the University Lake Watershed area without adversely
affecting the community water supply.
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #4
(7) CT CORPORATE TOWN. This district is designed to create a visually attractive,
commercial use district with flexible space. The district is intended to provide space
for assemblage and research and development type enterprises. Any structure in this
district which is proposed for non-residential use shall be located a minimum
distance of 50 feet from any residential dwelling unit in the district that was in
existence on July 1, 1985. In order to encourage the creation of flexible space, an
average minimum building height of 18 feet for any principal structure is required.
The continued use of existing residential dwelling units along North Greensboro
Street is encouraged. (AMENDED 06/20/06).
(8) B-3-T TRANSITION AREA BUSINESS. This district is designed to accommodate
commercial needs arising in the town’s more rural neighborhoods, especially in the
joint planning transition areas, and which are more appropriately dealt with at the
neighborhood level than at a community or regional level. To insure compatibility
between B-3-T areas and their associated rural neighborhoods, no B-3-T district
shall be greater than five acres, and no areas shall be zoned B-3-T if any portion of a
pre-existing business district lies within one-half mile in any direction.
(AMENDED 11/14/88)
(9) O OFFICE. This district is intended to provide locations for low intensity office and
institutional uses. This district is designed for parcels three (3) acres or less in size.
Rather than have new buildings constructed, it is intended and desired that any
existing residential structures within the district be converted and adapted to office
or institutional use. In order to assure compatibility of residential conversions or
new office construction with existing and future residential development, specific
performance measures to mitigate negative impacts of office development will be
required. Any development within the Office (O) district shall comply with the
following requirements:
a. Type A screening will be required between any non- residential use and
adjacent properties, except for openings necessary to allow pedestrian
movement between the office or institutional use and adjacent properties;
b. To the extent practicable, vehicle accommodation areas associated with uses
on lots in this district shall be located in the rear of buildings so that parking
areas are not readily visible from the streets, unless doing so would
adversely affect adjoining residential properties;
c. Whenever a new building is erected in this district, (i) the exterior walls
shall be constructed of materials commonly used on the exterior walls of
single-family residences (such as brick, stone, wood, or fabricated residential
lap siding made of hardboard, vinyl, or aluminum); (ii) the pitch of the roof
shall have a minimum vertical rise of one foot for every five feet of
horizontal run; provided that this requirement shall not apply to lots that
have frontage on any street where, within the same block as the property in
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #5
question, at least 75% of the buildings (in place on April 16, 1991) that front
along the same side of the street do not have roofs that comply with this
pitched roof standard; and (iii) windows shall be of a type commonly used in
single-family residences;
d. Manufacturer’s specifications for proposed outdoor lighting fixtures
(including candlepower distribution) must be included in the submitted
plans and maximum illumination areas must be delineated on the site plan.
Light sources (light bulbs or tubes) shall be shielded to reflect down onto the
ground and not out onto neighboring properties. (AMENDED 04/16/91)
(10) O/A OFFICE/ASSEMBLY. This district is intended to provide for office,
administrative, professional, research, and specialized manufacturing (such as light
assembly and processing) activities in close proximity to an arterial street. This
district is intended to provide employment near residential areas; therefore, the
required development standards are intended to be compatible to adjacent residential
uses and provide a park-like setting for employment. It is strongly encouraged that
development in the Office/Assembly zoning district be designed so that employees
may easily utilize alternative forms of transportation (such riding buses, cycling or
walking) to commute to their place of employment. Any development within the
Office/Assembly (O/A) district shall comply with the following requirements:
(AMENDED 05/25/99; 5/28/02)
a. No area less than five contiguous acres may be zoned as an Office/Assembly
district;
b. The performance standards (Article XI, Part I) applicable to 4.000
classification uses in business zones shall govern uses in an
Office/Assembly zone;
c. As shown in Section 15-308, Table of Screening Requirements, screening
will be required between non-residential uses in the Office/Assembly district
and adjacent residential properties;
d. Manufacturer’s specifications for proposed outdoor lighting fixtures (including
candlepower distribution) must be included in the submitted plans and
maximum illumination areas must be delineated on the site plan. Light sources
(light bulbs or tubes) shall be shielded to reflect down onto the ground and not
out onto neighboring properties. (AMENDED 04/16/91)
e. Not more than 25 percent of the total building gross floor constructed within the
proposed district may be used for uses permissible within this district that fall
within the 2.000 classification.
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #6
(11) O/A CU OFFICE/ASSEMBLY CONDITIONAL USE. This district is identical to the
O/A district and shall be subject to all regulations applicable to the O/A district
(including but not limited to the performance standards set forth in Part 1 of Article
XI) except as follows: (AMENDED 05/25/99; 5/28/02)
a. This district shall be a conditional use district authorized under N.C.G.S.
160A-382. As such, property may be placed within this district only in
response to a petition by the owners of all the property to be included.
b. No area less than four contiguous acres and no more than a total of twentyfive
(25) acres may be rezoned to the O/A CU.
c. As indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses, the only permissible use
within an O/A CU district is an office/assembly planned development, and
an office/assembly planned development is permissible only in an O/A CU
district.
1. The applicant for an office/assembly planned development
conditional use permit shall specify which of the use classifications
generally permissible with an O/A district the applicant wants to
make permissible within the proposed O/A CU district.
2. Once a conditional use permit authorizing an office/assembly
planned development has been issued, then individual tenants or
occupants of the spaces or properties covered by the permit may
occupy or use such individual spaces or properties without need for
additional zoning, special use, or conditional use permits, so long as
such use or occupancy is consistent with the approved conditional
use permit including limitations on permissible use classifications
approved pursuant to subsection 1 above or other conditions or
limitations imposed as conditions pursuant to Section 15-59.
3. Uses within the O/A CU district shall be limited to those where
loading and unloading occurs during daylight hours only.
c.1. Not more than 25 percent of the total building gross floor constructed within
the proposed district may be used for uses permissible within this district
that fall within the 2.000 classification.
d. When an O/A CU rezoning petition is submitted (in accordance with Article
XX of this chapter), the applicant shall simultaneously submit a conditional
use permit application for an office/assembly planned development.
1. The rezoning and conditional use permit applications shall be
processed and reviewed concurrently.
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #7
2. The Board of Aldermen shall simultaneously conduct a public
hearing on the rezoning and conditional use permit applications, in
accordance with the procedures applicable to other conditional use
permit applications.
3. If the Board concludes in the exercise of its legislative discretion that
the proposed rezoning would not be consistent with the public
health, safety, or welfare, it may deny the application in accordance
with the same procedures applicable to any ordinance amendment
request.
4. The Board may not approve the rezoning application unless it
simultaneously approves a conditional use permit for an
office/assembly planned development, which permit may be issued
subject to reasonable conditions and requirements a set forth in
Section 15-59.
e. Buildings within the O/A CU district shall comply with the following
standards:
1. Exterior walls shall be constructed of materials commonly used on
the exterior walls of single-family residences (such as brick, stone,
wood or fabricated residential lap siding made of hardboard or
vinyl).
2. The pitch of the roof shall have a minimum vertical rise of one foot
for every two feet of horizontal run.
3. Windows shall be of a scale and proportion typical of single-family
residences. (AMENDED 05/25/99)
Section 15-136.1 Historic Rogers Road District Established (ADDED 6/18/2019)
(a) The Historic Rogers Road district, HR-R (residential), is established to implement the
goals and recommendations of the Mapping Our Community’s Future community
planning effort, completed in May 2016. The intent of Mapping Our Community’s
Future and the HR-R District is to:
(1) Create opportunities for long-term residents to continue living in the
community and to age in place;
(2) Preserve the socioeconomic and cultural diversity of the neighborhood;
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #8
(3) Increase physical connections within the neighborhood, including for
pedestrians and bicyclists;
(4) Respect and protect the natural character of the neighborhood;
(5) Ensure that new development is consistent with neighborhood character
and the vision that residents have developed for its future;
(6) Provide greater residential housing choice, affordability, and diversity;
(7) Increase economic opportunities within the neighborhood;
(8) Increase recreational resources within the neighborhood; and
(9) Ensure that new development is adequately served by infrastructure,
including streets, sidewalks, and utilities.
(b) The HR-R zoning district is designed to protect and preserve the character of existing
lower-density areas (minimum lot size 14,520 square feet, or no more than three lots
per acre) within the neighborhood while providing for compatible new development,
including new housing choice options, and increased home occupation opportunities
for residents.
Section 15-137 Manufacturing Districts Established (AMENDED 6/22/82; 2/4/86).
(1) The M-1 and M-2 districts are hereby created to accomplish the purposes and serve
the objectives set forth in this subsection. Part of Article XI contains performance standards that
place limitations on the characteristics of uses located in the districts created by this section.
(a) M-1 LIGHT MANUFACTURING. This zone is designed to accommodate a
limited range of industrial activities and a wide range of commercial uses
including wholesaling, storage, mail-order, auto related, and office and retail
in conjunction with industrial or wholesaling uses. Permitted industrial uses
include enterprises engaged in manufacturing, processing, creating,
repairing, renovating, painting, cleaning and assembly where all operations
are contained inside a fully enclosed building. The performance standards
for the M-1 zone located in Part I of Article XI are more restrictive than
those in the M-2 district.
(b) M-2 GENERAL MANUFACTURING. This district is designed to
accommodate the widest range of industrial uses. Business operations may
be conducted within and outside a fully enclosed building. The performance
standards for this zone are less restrictive than those in the M-1 district.
(2) There is also established a watershed light industrial (WM-3) zoning district. The
purpose of this district is to allow areas within the University Lake Watershed that have been zoned
M-1 prior to the effective date of this subdivision to continue to be used and developed for light
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #9
industrial and related purposes, subject to certain restrictions designed to protect the watershed.
Consistent with the purpose of this zone, this district shall be confined to that area zoned M-1 on
the effective date of this subsection (12/7/1983); this area shall not be expanded and no new WM-3
areas shall be designated. For the purposes of this section, changes to make WM-3 zoning uniform
on lots that were depicted as entirely within the M-1 zoning at the time of its establishment, but that
were later depicted as being bisected by the zoning boundary, will not be considered an expansion
of the district or the creation of new WM-3 areas (AMENDED 12/7/83, 06/27/17)
(3) There is also established a Planned Industrial Development (PID) zoning district.
The purpose of this district is to provide for the possibility of well planned and tightly controlled
industrial development in areas that are suitable for such development but that are not deemed
appropriate for M-1 or M-2 zoning because of the less restricted types of development that may
occur in such zones. (AMENDED 6/22/82; 12/7/83)
(a) No area less than twenty contiguous acres may be zoned as a Planned
Industrial Development district, and then only upon a request submitted by
or on behalf of the owner or owners of all the property intended to be
covered by such zone.
(b) As indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses (Section 15-146) a planned
industrial development (use classification 30.000) is the only permissible use
in a PID zone.
(c) Subject to subdivision (2) of this subsection, and consistent with the
restrictions contained in the definition of a planned industrial development
[see Subdivision 15-15(60)], land within a PID zone may be used in a
manner that would be permissible if the land were zoned M-1, except that (i)
the only permissible uses are those described in the 2.130 and 4.100
classifications and (ii) the performance standards (Article XI, Part I)
applicable to 4.100 uses in business zones shall govern uses in a planned
industrial development.
Section 15-138 Public Facilities District Established.
There is hereby created a Public Facilities (P-F) zoning district. Within this district, those
uses indicated as permissible in the Table of Permissible Uses may be developed, but only if such
developments are owned and operated by the United States, the State of North Carolina, Orange
County, the Town of Carrboro, or any agency, department, or subdivision of the foregoing
governments.
Section 15-139 Planned Unit Development District Established.
(1) There are hereby established sixty different Planned Unit Development (PUD)
zoning districts as described in this section. Each PUD zoning district is designed to combine the
characteristics of at least two and possibly three zoning districts. (AMENDED 2/24/87)

(a) One element of each PUD district shall be the residential element. Here
there are six possibilities, each one corresponding to one of the following
residential districts identified in Section 15-135: R-20, R-15, R-10, R-7.5,
R-3, or R- S.I.R. Within that portion of the PUD zone that is developed for
purposes permissible in a residential district, all development must be in
accordance with the regulations applicable to the residential zoning district
to which the particular PUD zoning district corresponds.
(b) A second element of each PUD district shall be the commercial element.
Here there are five possibilities, each one corresponding to either the B-1(g),
B-2, B-3, O, or O/A zoning districts established by Section 15-136. Within
that portion of a PUD district that is developed for purposes permissible in a
commercial district, all development must be in accordance with the
regulations applicable to the commercial district to which the PUD district
corresponds. (AMENDED 02/04/97)
(c) A manufacturing/processing element may be a third element of any PUD
district. Here there are two alternatives. The first is that uses permitted
within the M-1 district would be permitted within the PUD district. The
second alternative is that uses permitted only within the M-1 or M-2 zoning
districts would not be permitted. If an M-1 element is included, then within
that portion of the PUD district that is developed for purposes permissible in
an M-1 district, all development must be in accordance with the regulations
applicable to the M-1 district.
The sixty different PUD zoning districts are derived from the various combinations of possible
alternatives within each of the three elements -- residential, commercial, manufacturing/processing.
For example, there is an R-20/B-1(g)/M-1 district, an R-20/B-2/M-1 district, an R-20/B-2 district,
an R-15/B-1(g)/M-1 district, etc. (AMENDED 02/04/97)
(2) No area of less than twenty-five contiguous acres may be zoned as a Planned Unit
Development district, and then only upon the request of the owner or owners of all of the property
intended to be covered by such zone.
(3) As indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses (Section 15-146), a planned unit
development (use classification 28.000) is the only permissible use in a PUD zone, and planned
unit developments are permissible only in such zones.
Section 15-140 Residential High Density and Commercial Overlay District (AMENDED
2/4/86)
There is hereby created a Residential High Density and Commercial Overlay (RHDC)
zoning district. The purpose of this district is to provide for the redevelopment of deteriorating
commercial and manufacturing areas in a manner that is consistent with commercial development
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #11
goals of the town, namely, for compact, compressed town center growth, for a substantial increase
in residential opportunities near the town center, and for mixed use development in the downtown.
Property that lies within this overlay district may be developed in accordance with either the
regulations applicable to the underlying district or the following regulations:
(1) To take advantage of provisions applicable to the RHDC overlay district, lots must
contain at least one and one half acres of contiguous land under single ownership.
(2) Uses permissible shall be those permissible within either the R-2 district or the
B-1(c) district, or both, except that subdivisions other than architecturally integrated
subdivisions shall not be allowed.
(3) Residential density shall be determined as if the property were zoned R-2.
(4) Twenty percent of the lot area shall remain as usable open space (see Section
15-198), except that where the development seeks to provide interior open space or
indoor hard court, pool, or other active recreation facilities in excess of the basic
requirement set forth in Article XIII, the permit-issuing authority may reduce the
open space requirement to reflect the quality and amount of such facilities. The
developer may substitute grassed areas, lawn, gardens, and shrubbed space for
wooded space in meeting the requirements of 15-198(b)(3).
(5) Subject to subdivision (6), the amount of floor area set aside or used for purposes
not permissible within the R-2 district (i.e, commercial uses) may not exceed ten
percent of the floor area used for residential purposes.
(6) Where at least one-third of the total number of parking spaces for the development
are provided on a tier or level other than ground level (as with underground parking
or a two tier parking garage) and where the open space is increased to 40% of the
development tract, the development may either (i) increase the commercial floor
area over that allowed in subdivision (5) to 25% of the floor area in residential use,
or (ii) increase the density for residential use to 1,500 square feet per dwelling unit.
(7) The maximum building height for the district shall be 50 feet. A building that is
over 35 feet shall be set-in and setback 2 additional feet for every additional foot
above 35 feet in height.
(8) Commercial space shall be located at ground level or on the top level of a building.
(9) Except as otherwise provided herein, the regulations applicable to land within an
R-2 district shall apply to property within a RHDC district.
Section 15-140.1 Office-Residential Mixed Use District (AMENDED 6/20/06)
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #12
(a) There is hereby created an Office-Residential Mixed Use (OR-MU) zoning district.
The purpose of this district is to provide for mixed use developments, i.e. developments that
contain both residential and non-residential elements, within areas that are near the downtown
commercial districts.
(b) Any lot within the OR-MU district that exists on the effective date of this section or
that is hereafter created may be developed and used for those purposes within the 3.000
classification that are permissible within the B-2 zoning district, subject to the same permitting
requirements and other applicable regulations of this chapter, just as if the property were zoned
B-2.
(c) Any lot or tract within the OR-MU district may be developed as a mixed use project
in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.
(1) Development of property under this subsection requires the issuance of a conditional
use permit by the Board of Aldermen in accordance with the applicable provisions of
this chapter.
(2) A mixed use project approved under this subsection must have both a residential and
a nonresidential component.
(3) At least one-half but not more than two-thirds of the gross floor area of the mixed use
development shall consist of residential uses listed in use classifications 1.100, 1.200,
1.300, or 1.400, 1.510 (hotels and motels) and 1.520 (tourist homes and other
temporary residences), provided that use classifications 1.510 and 1.520 shall not
comprise more than one-third of the residential component. However, the residential
component of the mixed use development may be increased to ninety percent of the
floor area of the mixed use development if the developer donates to a non-profit
agency engaged in providing affordable housing at least ten percent of the total
acreage within the development and enters into an enforceable agreement with such
agency to construct on such land and convey to the agency, at not more than the
developer’s cost, the number of housing units for which the agency obtains a permit.
For purposes of this subsection, the phrase “within the development” means within
the area covered by the conditional use permit issued for the mixed use development
as well as any adjacent property that is or was owned by the developer of the mixed
use project and that is conveyed to a non-profit agency and developed for affordable
housing as described herein, even if such other area is not located with the Town of
Carrboro.
(4) The permissible residential density within the mixed use development shall be
calculated as if the development were zoned R-3, except that the density shall be
calculated as if the property were zoned R-2 if the developer conveys at least ten
percent of the land within the development to a non-profit agency and constructs on
that land affordable housing as described in subsection (c)(3) above. For purposes of
this subsection, if land that is not located within the Town of Carrboro is regarded as
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #13
“within the development” as that phrase is defined in subsection (c)(3) above, then
such area shall be considered part of the development for purposes of calculating the
permissible residential density under this subsection.
(5) Subject to the other provisions of this subsection, the dimensional and other
requirements of this chapter applicable to the R-3 district shall apply to a mixed use
development permitted under this section. However, the maximum height of
buildings within the mixed use development, shall be four stories, except that a fifth
story shall be permitted if the developer conveys at least ten percent of the land
within the development to a non-profit agency and constructs on that land of
affordable housing as described in subsection (c)(3) above. Notwithstanding other
provisions of this chapter, any parking levels that are constructed underneath a
building within a mixed use development and that are at least in substantial part
constructed below the ground service levels shall not be regarded as “stories” for
purposes of the height limitations established herein.
(6) Permissible uses within the commercial component of the mixed use shall be those
listed in the following use classifications within the Table of Permissible Uses: (i)
use classification 3.100; (i) use classifications 2.110, 2.112, 2.120, 2.130, 2.150,
2.210, 2.220, provided that such uses do not comprise more than fifty percent of the
total commercial space within the mixed use development; and (iii) restaurant uses
8.100, 8.200, and 8.500, so long as any one restaurant business does not occupy more
than 1,500 square feet of gross floor area and so long as such restaurant uses do not
operate during the hours of 2:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.
(7) A mixed use development may be constructed in phases as provided in Section 15-
61. However, the phasing plan shall ensure that, as buildings are constructed and
occupied, the relative mix of residential and commercial floor space remains
substantially consistent with the percentages approved in the plans.
(8) If portions of the mixed use development are subdivided, the final plat shall contain
notations indicating any limitations on uses or the sequencing of development created
as a result of approval of the development as a mixed use under this section.
Section 15-141 Neighborhood Preservation District Established (AMENDED 09/26/89;
11/21/95; 5/27/08)
(a) There are hereby established an Historic District (HD) and a Neighborhood
Preservation District (NPD).
(1) HD HISTORIC DISTRICT. This district is designed to apply to areas which
are deemed to be of special significance in terms of their history, architecture
and/or culture, and to possess integrity of design, setting, materials, feeling and
association. The historic district is one of Carrboro’s most valued and important
assets and is established for the following purposes: to protect and conserve the
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #14
heritage of Carrboro, Orange County and the State of North Carolina; to preserve
the social, economic, cultural, political, and architectural history of the district and
its individual properties; to promote the education, pleasure and enrichment of
residents in the district and Carrboro and Orange County and the State as a whole;
to encourage tourism and increased commercial activity; to foster civic beauty;
and to stabilize and enhance property values throughout the district as a whole,
thus contributing to the improvement of the general health and welfare of
Carrboro and any residents of the district.
(2) NPD NEIGHBORHOOD PRESERVATION DISTRICT. This district is
designed to apply to areas which are deemed to possess form, character, and
visual qualities from arrangements or combinations of architectural or
appurtenant features or places of historical or cultural significance that create
an image of stability, local identity, and livable atmosphere. This district is
established to achieve the same objectives and purposes as those set forth above
with respect to the historic district.
(b) The HD and NPD districts are overlay districts, and properties within these
districts are subject to the regulations applicable to the underlying district as well as the
requirements set forth in Article XXI of this chapter.
Section 15-141.1 Jordan Lake Watershed Districts Established (AMENDED 10/15/96)
(a) There is hereby established an overlay district to be known as the Jordan Lake
Watershed Protection District (JLWP). The purpose of this overlay district is to provide for the
imposition of regulations applicable to areas within the town’s planning jurisdiction that are part of
the Jordan Lake WS-IV Watershed in order to comply with the provisions of Article 21, Chapter
143 of the North Carolina General Statutes.
(b) Because the JLWP district is an overlay district, properties within this district are
subject to the regulations applicable to the underlying district as well as the requirements of the
JLWP district.
Section 15-141.2 Village Mixed Use District Established (AMENDED 05/25/99)
(a) There is hereby established a Village Mixed Use (VMU) district. This district is
established to provide for the development of rural new villages at a scale intended to continue
Carrboro’s small town character as described in its Year 2000 Task Force Report and to promote a
traditional concept of villages. The applicant for rezoning to this district must demonstrate that its
planning, design and development will achieve, but not necessarily be limited to, all of the
following specific objectives:
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #15
(1) The preservation of open space, scenic vistas, agricultural lands and natural
resources within the Town of Carrboro and its planning jurisdiction and to
minimize the potential for conflict between such areas and other land uses;
(2) The creation of a distinct physical settlement surrounded by a protected
landscape of generally open land used for agricultural, forest, recreational
and environmental protection purposes.
(3) Dwellings, shops, and workplaces generally located in close proximity to
each other, the scale of which accommodates and promotes pedestrian travel
for trips within the village.
(4) Modestly sized buildings fronting on, and aligned with, streets in a
disciplined manner.
(5) A generally rectilinear pattern of streets, alleys and blocks reflecting the
street network in existing small villages which provides for a balanced mix
of pedestrians and automobiles.
(6) Squares greens, landscaped streets and parks woven into street and block
patterns to provide space for social activity, parks and visual enjoyment.
(7) Provision of buildings for civic assembly or for other common purposes that
act as visual landmarks and symbols of identity within the community.
(8) A recognizable, functionally diverse, but visually unified village focused on
a village green or square.
(9) Development of a size and scale, which accommodates and promotes
pedestrian travel rather than motor vehicle trips within the village.
(10) Compliance with the policies embodied in this chapter for the development
of a village mixed use.
(b) The VMU district shall be a conditional use district authorized under N.C.G.S.
160A-382. As such, property may be placed within this district only in response to a petition by the
owners of all the property to be included.
(c) As indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses, the only permissible use within a
VMU district is a village mixed use development, and a village mixed use development is only
permissible within a VMU district.
(d) Property may be rezoned to the VMU district only when the property proposed for
such rezoning:
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #16
(1) Comprises at least fifty, but not more than two hundred, contiguous acres.
For purposes of this subsection, acreage is not “contiguous” to other acreage
if separated by a public street or connected only at a point less than one
hundred feet in width; and
(2) Is so located in relationship to existing or proposed public streets that traffic
generated by the development of the tract proposed for rezoning can be
accommodated without endangering the public health, safety, or welfare;
and
(3) Will be served by OWASA water and sewer lines when developed;
(e) No more than 350 gross acres may be rezoned to the VMU district and no more than
three villages may be approved.
(f) Nothing in this section is intended to limit the discretion of the Board of Aldermen
to deny an application to rezone property to a VMU district if it determines that the proposed
rezoning is not in the public interest.
(g) When a VMU rezoning application is submitted (in accordance with Article XX of
this ordinance), the applicant shall simultaneously submit an application for approval of a master
plan for the proposed village mixed use development, in accordance with the following provisions.
(1) The master plan shall show, through a combination of graphic means and
text (including without limitation proposed conditions to be included in the
conditional use permit for the proposed development):
a. The location, types, and densities of residential uses;
b. The location, types, and maximum floor areas and impervious
surface areas for non-residential uses;
c. The location and orientation of buildings, parking areas, recreational
facilities, and open spaces;
d. Access and circulation systems for vehicles and pedestrians;
e. How the development proposes to satisfy the objectives of and
comply with the regulations applicable to a village mixed use
development as set forth in Section 15-176.2 of this chapter;
f. How the development proposes to minimize or mitigate any adverse
impacts on neighboring properties and the environment, including
without limitation impacts from traffic and stormwater runoff; and
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #17
g. How the development proposes to substantially comply with the
town’s recommended “Village Mixed Use Vernacular Architectural
Standards.” (AMENDED 8/22/06).
(2) The planning board, Northern Transition Advisory Committee, Appearance
Commission, Environmental Advisory Board, Transportation Advisory
Board (and other advisory boards to which the Board of Aldermen may refer
the application) shall review the proposed master plan at the same time it
considers the applicant’s rezoning request. In response to suggestions made
by the planning board (or other advisory boards), the applicant may revise
the master plan before it is submitted to the Board of Aldermen.
(3) If the applicant submits a proposed master plan with a VMU rezoning
application, then:
a. Applicants for VMU districts that are located within the Transition Area
portion of the Carrboro Joint Development Area as defined within the
Joint Planning Agreement should meet with Carrboro Town and Orange
County Planning staff prior to the formal submittal of an application to
informally discuss the preliminary rezoning development plan.
b. The rezoning application and master plan proposal shall be reviewed
concurrently by the Board of Aldermen according to the same
procedures and in accordance with the same standards applicable to
other zoning amendments; and
c. The Board may not approve the VMU rezoning application unless it
simultaneously approves the master plan for the development of the
property, subject to such reasonable modifications and conditions as
the Board may impose in the exercise of its legislative discretion.
(4) Approval of a VMU rezoning application with a master plan under this
section does not obviate the need to obtain a conditional use permit for the
village mixed use development in accordance with the provisions of Section
15-176.2 of this chapter.
a. With respect to VMU applications involving property that is totally
or partly within the Transition Area portion of the Carrboro Joint
Development Area as defined within the Joint Planning Agreement,
in addition to other grounds for denial of a conditional use permit
application under this chapter, a conditional use permit for a village
mixed use development shall be denied if the application is
inconsistent with the approved master plan in any substantial way.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, an application for a
conditional use permit is inconsistent in a substantial way with a
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #18
previously approved master plan if the plan of development
proposed under the conditional use permit application increases the
residential density or commercial floor area permissible on the
property or decreases or alters the location of open space areas.
b. With respect to property that is located totally outside the Transition
Area portion of the Carrboro Joint Development Area as defined
within the Joint Planning Agreement, in addition to other grounds
for denial of a conditional use permit application under this chapter,
no conditional use permit for a village mixed use development may
be denied on the basis that the application is inconsistent with the
approved master plan. However, if the conditional use permit is
approved, the Board of Aldermen shall be deemed to have amended
the master plan to bring it into conformity with the conditional use
permit.
c. No conditional use permit for a village neighborhood mixed use
development may be denied for reasons set forth in Subsection 15-
54(c)(4) if the basis for such denial involves an element or effect of
the development that has previously been specifically addressed and
approved in the master plan approval process, unless (i) it can be
demonstrated that the information presented to the Board of
Aldermen at the master plan approval stage was materially false or
misleading, (ii) conditions have changed substantially in a manner
that could not reasonably have been anticipated, or (iii) a basis for
denial for reasons set forth in Subsection 15-54(c)(4) is demonstrated
by clear and convincing evidence.
(5) Subject to Subsection 15-141.2(g)(4)b, a master plan approved under this
section may only be amended in accordance with the provisions applicable
to a rezoning of the property in question.
Section 15-141.3 Conditional Use Zoning Districts (AMENDED 5/25/04; 4/28/15; 10/23/18
AMENDED)
(a) The following conditional use zoning districts are hereby established: RR-CU, R-20-
CU, R-15-CU, R-10-CU, R-7.5-CU, R-3-CU, R-2-CU, R-S.I.R-CU, R-S.I.R.-2-CU, B-1(c)-CU,
B-1(g)-CU, B-2-CU, B-3-CU, B-4-CU, CT-CU, B-3-T-CU, O-CU, M-1-CU, and M-2-CU. A
Special Manufacturing Conditional Use (M-3-CU) zoning district is also established. The
provisions of this section applicable to these conditional use-zoning districts do not affect or
apply to the Office/Assembly Conditional Use District, or the Village Mixed Use Conditional
Use District.
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #19
(b) The conditional use zoning districts established in this section may be applied to
property only in response to a petition signed by all the owners of the property to be included
within such district.
(c) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the uses permissible within a
conditional u s e zoning district established herein, and the regulations applicable
to property within such a district, shall be those uses that are permissible within and
those regulations that are applicable to the general use zoning district to which the
conditional use district corresponds. For example, property that is rezoned to a B-2-
CU district may be developed in the same manner as property that is zoned B-2,
except as provided in this subsection.
(1) Property that is zoned B-4-CU may be developed for use classifications
1.231 (duplex, maximum 20% units > 3 bedrooms/dwelling unit), 1.241 (two
family apartment, maximum 20% units > 3 bedrooms/dwelling unit), 1.321
(multi-family residences, maximum 20% units > bedrooms/dwelling unit and
1.331 (multi-family, maximum 20% units > 3 bedrooms/dwelling unit) in
addition to other uses permissible in the B-4 district, subject to a conditional
use permit and the following: (i) not more than 25% of the total land area
covered by the CUP in this district may be developed for such uses; and (ii) the
area developed for such uses shall have a minimum of 1,500 square feet per
dwelling unit (except that applicable density bonuses shall apply).
(2) (Reserved)
(c1) and other provisions of this section, the uses permissible within a conditional use zoning
district established herein, and the regulations applicable to property within such a district, shall
be those uses that are permissible within and those regulations that are applicable to the general
use zoning district to which the conditional use district corresponds. For example, property that
is rezoned to a B-2-CU district may be developed in the same manner as property that is zoned
B-2, except as provided in this section.
(c1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the uses that are permissible within
a M-3-CU district, and the regulations applicable to property within such a district shall be those
uses and those regulations that would be applicable to any property zoned M-1-CU (i.e.
excluding specific conditions made applicable to specific property zoned M-1-CU) with the
addition of use 3.250.
1. If the Board concludes that a proposed development of property zoned M-3- CU
will contain site and building elements that will create a more vibrant and successful
community and provide essential public infrastructure, the Board may approve a
conditional use permit that allows up to a specified maximum percentage of the
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #20
gross floor area of the development to be devoted to any combination of uses 8.100,
8.200, 8.500, 8.600, and 8.700. The specified maximum percentage of the gross floor
area of the development that may be devoted to such uses shall be proportional to the
extent to which the development provides site and building elements that exceed the
basic requirements of this ordinance. Such site and building elements are intended to
be selected from the following five areas: stormwater management and water
conservation; substantial transportation improvement and alternative transportation
enhancement; on-site energy production and energy conservation; creation of new
and innovative light manufacturing operations; and the provision of public art and/or
provision of outdoor amenities for public use.
2. The following relationships between site and building elements and uses are
hereby deemed to satisfy the standard set forth in subdivision (1) of this subsection:
(i) up to fifteen percent of the gross floor area of a development approved pursuant to
this section may be devoted to any combination of uses 8.100, 8.200, 8.500, 8.600,
and 8.700 if the development includes at least fifteen percent of the examples of
performance measures from the five areas of site and building element categories set
forth below; (ii) up to thirty percent of the gross floor area of a development
approved pursuant to this section may be devoted to any combination of the
foregoing uses if the development includes at least thirty percent of the examples of
performance measures from the five areas of site and building element categories set
forth below; and (iii) up to forty percent of the gross floor area of a development
approved pursuant to this section may be devoted to any combination of the
foregoing uses if the development includes at least forty percent of the examples of
performance measures from the five areas of site and building element categories set
forth below. In addition, the Board may allow up to forty percent of a development
approved pursuant to this section to be devoted to any combination of the foregoing
uses if it concludes that the development will be making a substantial enough
investment in one or more of the performance measures listed below to satisfy the
standard set forth in subdivision (1) of this subsection.

3. In approving a conditional use permit for a development of infill property zoned
M-3- CU, the Board may allow deviations from the otherwise applicable standards
relating to public streets as follows:
a. The Board may approve a curb and gutter street having a right-of way of not
less than 50 feet, travel lanes of not less than 11 feet, divided by a raised concrete
median, with a two foot planting strip and a five foot sidewalk if the
development provides a separate ten-foot wide paved bike path or shared-use
path that constitutes a satisfactory alternative to a bike lane with the street
right-of-way if the applicant can demonstrate that the proposed road will provide
the functional equivalent to the required street classification standard for
all modes of travel from the point of origin to the terminus at the property
boundaries.
b. The Board may approve a street lighting system consisting of LED lights on
15 foot poles if satisfactory arrangements are made to ensure that all costs
associated with the installation, operation, and maintenance of such poles and
lights are borne by the developer or the developer’s successor, and not the
Town.
c. The Board may approve a street tree planting plan that provides for the
installation of fewer 6” caliper trees rather than the planting of more
numerous 2” caliper trees required by Section 15-316.
(d) Subject to subsection(s) (f) and (g), all uses that are permissible in the conditional
use zoning district shall require the issuance of a conditional use permit, regardless of whether
a use in the corresponding general use district would ordinarily require (according to the Table
of Permissible Uses) a zoning permit, special use permit, or conditional use permit.
(AMENDED 10/23/18)
(e) When a rezoning petition for a conditional use zoning district is submitted (in
accordance with Article XX of this chapter), the applicant shall simultaneously submit a
conditional use permit application showing how the applicant proposes to develop the entirety of
the property covered in the rezoning petition.
1. The rezoning and conditional use permit applications shall be processed and
reviewed concurrently.
2. The Board of Aldermen shall simultaneously conduct a public hearing on the
rezoning and conditional use permit applications, in accordance with the
procedures applicable to other conditional use permit applications.
3. If the Board concludes in the exercise of its legislative discretion that the
proposed rezoning would not be consistent with the public health, safety, or
welfare, it may deny the application in accordance with the same procedures
applicable to any ordinance amendment request.
4. When a rezoning petition for a conditional use zoning district is submitted (in
accordance with Article XX of this chapter), the application shall include a list
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #23
of proposed conditions (which may be in the form of written statements,
graphic illustrations, or any combination thereof) to be incorporated into the
conditional use permit issued in conjunction with the rezoning to the requested
conditional use zoning district. The list of proposed conditions may be
modified by the planning staff, advisory boards, or Board of Aldermen as the
rezoning application works its way through the process described in Article
XX, but only those conditions mutually approved by the applicant and the
Board may be incorporated into the conditional use permit. Conditions and
site-specific standards imposed in this process shall be limited to (i) those that
address the conformance of the development and use of the site to the
provisions of this chapter or to applicable plans adopted by the Board, and (ii)
those that address the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the
development and use of the site.
5. If the conditional use permit is allowed to expire (under Section 15-62), the
Board may initiate action to rezone the property to any appropriate general use
district classification. In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this
ordinance, the Board shall be under no obligation to consider any major
modification of a conditional use permit issued in connection with a
conditional use rezoning or any new conditional use permit for property that
has been the subject of a conditional use rezoning.
(f) If a conditional use permit issued in connection with a conditional use rezoning
authorizes the creation of a residential subdivision containing lots intended for development
with not more than four dwelling units each, and the conditional use permit application does
not provide sufficient information to authorize a development permit for such lots, then such
lots may be developed pursuant to the issuance of a zoning permit (i.e. each lot will not require
an amendment to the conditional use permit issued for the overall development).
(g) If a tract is rezoned to a B-4-CU zoning district, the Board of Aldermen may, in
connection with that rezoning, approve a conditional use permit that authorizes the tract
to be divided into two or more lots, so long as (i) the application for the CUP contains
sufficient information to allow the Board of Aldermen to approve (and the Board does
approve) such subdivision (including without limitation the street system, stormwater control
system, open spaces, and all other common areas and facilities outside the boundaries of
the subdivided lots) as well as the development of at least one of the lots within the
sub-divided tract, all in accordance with the applicable standards and requirements of
this chapter (i.e, the subdivision and development of such lot(s) require no further review
by the Board); and (ii) the application specifies (as a proposed condition on the CUP) the use
or uses, maximum height, and maximum floor area of any structure(s) allowed on each lot
for which the application does not provide sufficient information to allow development
approval by the Board. (AMENDED 10/23/18)
(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 15-64(d), with respect to lots for
which the application for a CUP for the entire tract does not provide sufficient
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #24
information to allow development approval of such lots by the Board, the Board
shall specify (by way of a condition upon the CUP) whether development approval
of such lots shall be regarded as an insignificant deviation or a minor
modification, or shall require a new application. In making this determination, the
Board shall consider the extent to which the initial CUP imposes limitations on the
use and design of each such lot beyond the minimum requirements of this section.
The Board’s determination as to the type of approval of such lots shall apply only
to applications that are consistent with the permi t previous ly approved by the
Board. Such appl i cat ions may be submitted by persons who have an interest
(as described in Section 15-48) only in such lots, rather than the developer of the
entire tract zoned B-4-CU.
(2) Except as provided in subsection (1), the provisions of Section 15-64 and
Subsection 15-141.3 shall apply to proposed changes to a CUP issued in connection
with a B-4- CU rezoning.
Section 15-141.4 Conditional Zoning Districts (AMENDED 5/27/08)
(a) Conditional zoning districts are zoning districts in which the development and use of
the property so zoned are governed by the regulations applicable to one of the general use zoning
districts listed in the Table of Permissible Uses, as modified by the conditions and restrictions
imposed as part of the legislative decision creating the district and applying it to the particular
property. Accordingly, the following conditional zoning districts may be established:
R-20-CZ, R-15-CZ, R-10-CZ, R-7.5-CZ, R-3-CZ, R-2-CZ, R-R-CZ, R-S.I.R.-CZ , and
R-S.I.R.-2-CZ
B-1(C)-CZ, B-1(G)-CZ, B-2-CZ, B-3-CZ, B-3-T-CZ, B-4-CZ, CT-CZ, O-CZ, OACZ,
M-1-CZ, M-2-CZ (AMENDED 4/27/10; 06/23/15; 10/23/18)
(b) The conditional zoning districts authorized by this section may be applied to property
only in response to a petition signed by all the owners of the property to be included within such
district.
(c) Subject to the provisions of subsections (f) and (g), the uses permissible within
a conditional zoning district authorized by this section, and the regulations
applicable to property within such a district, shall be those uses that are permissible within
and those regulations that are applicable to the general use zoning district to which the
conditional district corresponds, except as those uses and regulations are limited by conditions
imposed pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. For example, property that is rezoned to a
B-2-CZ district may be developed in the same manner as property that is zoned B-2, subject
to any conditions imposed pursuant to subsection (d). (AMENDED 10/23/18)
(1) Property that is zoned B-4-CZ may be developed for use classifications
1.231 (duplex, maximum 20% units > 3 bedrooms/dwelling unit), 1.241 (two
family apartment, maximum 20% units > 3 bedrooms/dwelling unit), 1.321
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #25
(multi-family residences, maximum 20% units > bedrooms/dwelling unit and
1.331 (multi-family, maximum 20% units > 3 bedrooms/dwelling unit) 1 in
addition to other uses permissible in the B-4 district, subject to a conditional use
permit, and the following: (i) not more than 25% of the total land area covered in
this district may be developed for such uses; and (ii) the area developed for
such uses shall have a minimum of 1,500 square feet per dwelling unit (except
that applicable density bonuses shall apply).
(2) (Reserved) (AMENDED 11/9/11)
(d) When a rezoning petition for a conditional zoning district is submitted (in accordance
with Article XX of this chapter), the application shall include a list of proposed conditions
(which may be in the form of written statements, graphic illustrations, or any combination
thereof) to be incorporated into the ordinance that rezones the property to the requested
conditional zoning district. (AMENDED 10/25/16)
(d1) A rezoning petition may be submitted to allow use classification 3.260 Social
Service Provider with Dining within a building of more than two stories or 35 feet in height.
(AMENDED 10/25/16)
(1) The petition shall include information that demonstrates that, if the project is
completed as proposed, it:
a. Will not substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting property;
and
b. Will be in harmony with the area in which it is to be located. The
manner in which a project is designed to accommodate additional building
height including, but not limited to, scale, architectural detailing,
compatibility with the existing built environment and with adopted policy
statements in support of vibrant and economically successful and
sustainable, mixed-use, core commercial districts shall be among the
issues that may be considered to make a finding that a project is or is not
in harmony with the area in which it is to be located. The applicant may
use a variety of graphic and descriptive means to illustrate these findings;
and
c.Will be in general conformity with the Land Use Plan, Thoroughfare
Plan, and other plans officially adopted by the Board. (AMENDED
03/22/16, 10/25/16)
(2) All relative provisions of the Land Use Ordinance shall apply except to the
extent that such provisions are superseded by the provisions of this section or any
conditions incorporated into the conditional zoning district described in
subsection (d1) above. (AMENDED 10/25/16)
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #26
(e) The list of proposed conditions may be modified by the planning staff, advisory
boards, or Board of Aldermen as the rezoning application works its way through the process
described in Article XX, but only those conditions mutually approved by the applicant and the
Board may be incorporated into the conditional zoning district shall be limited to (i) those that
address the conformance of the development and use of the site to the provisions of this chapter
or to applicable plans adopted by the Board, and (ii) those that address the impacts reasonably
expected to be generated by the development or use of the site. (AMENDED 03/22/16,
10/25/16)
(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, all uses that are permissible in the B-4-CZ zoning
district shall require the issuance of a conditional use permit.(AMENDED 10/23/18)
(g) All uses that are permissible in the conditional zoning district shall require the
issuance of the same type of permit that such use in the corresponding general use district would
ordinarily require (according to the Table of Permissible Uses), i.e. a zoning permit, special use
permit, or conditional use permit.
(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in approving a rezoning to a B-1(g) – CZ zoning
district, the Board of Aldermen may authorize the property so zoned to be developed at a higher
level of residential density than that otherwise permissible in B-1(g) zoning districts under
Section 15-182 if the rezoning includes conditions that provide for site and building elements
that will create a more vibrant and successful community. Site and building elements are
intended to be selected from at least three of the following seven areas: stormwater management,
water conservation, energy conservation, on-site energy production, alternative transportation,
provision of affordable housing, and the provision of public art and/or provision of outdoor
amenities for public use. Conditions that may be included to meet the above stated objective
include but shall not be limited to the following: (AMENDED 11/9/11)
(1) Reduction in nitrogen loading from the site by at least 8% from the existing
condition, as determined by the Jordan Lake Accounting Tool
(2) Energy performance in building requirements to meet one or more of the
following
a. Achieve 40% better than required in the Model Energy Code, which
for NC, Commercial is ASHRAE 90.1-2004-2006 IECC equivalent or
better, and Residential is IECC 2006, equivalent or better).
b. “Designed to Earn the Energy Star” rating.
c. Architecture 2030 goal of a 50 percent fossil fuel and greenhouse gas
emission reduction standard, measured from the regional (or country)
average for that building type.
d. AIA goals of integrated, energy performance design, including
resource conservation resulting in a minimum 50 percent or greater
reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels used to construct and
operate buildings.
e. LEED certification to achieve 50% CO2 emission reduction, or LEED
silver certification
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #27
f. US Conference of Mayors fossil fuel reduction standard for all new
buildings to carbon neutral by 2030.
g. Specific energy saving features, including but not limited to the
following, are encouraged..
i. Use of shading devices and high performance glass for minimizing
heating and cooling loads
ii. Insulation beyond minimum standards;
iii. Use of energy efficient motors/HVAC;
iv. Use of energy efficient lighting;
v. Use of energy efficient appliances
vi. LED or LED/Solar parking lot lighting (50-100% more efficient).
vii. Active and passive solar features.
(3) Provision of onsite facilities (e.g. solar, wind, geothermal) that will provide
5% of electricity demand associated with the project.
(4) Use of harvested rainwater for toilet flushing.
(5) Parking lot meets the standard for a “green” parking lot, per the EPA
document Green “Parking Lot Resource Guide.”
(6) Inclusion of Low Impact Development features.

(10) Provision of public art and/or outdoor amenities for public use.
(11) Use of surface materials that reflect heat rather than absorb it.
(12) Use of devices that shade at least 30% of south-facing and west-facing
building facades.
(13) Provision of affordable housing in accordance with Town policy.
(h) If a B-1(g) – CZ zoning district is created and, pursuant to subsection (f) of this
section, a higher level of residential density than that otherwise permissible in B-1(g) zoning
districts is approved for that district, then it shall be a requirement of such district that at least
twenty percent (20%) of the total leasable or saleable floor area within all buildings located
within such zoning district shall be designed for non-residential use. Occupancy permits may not
be given for residential floor area if doing so would cause the ratio of residential floor area for
which an occupancy permit has been issued to non-residential floor area for which an occupancy
permit has been issued to exceed four to one (4:1). (AMENDED 11/9/11)
(i) For property that is zoned B-4-CZ, the Board of Aldermen may approve a conditional
use permit that authorizes the tract to be divided into two or more lots, so long as (i) the
application for the CUP contains sufficient information to allow the Board of Aldermen to
approve (and the Board does approve) such subdivision (including without limitation the
street system, stormwater control system, open spaces, and all other common areas and
facilities outside the boundaries of the subdivided lots) as well as the development of at least
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #28
one of the lots within the subdivided tract, all in accordance with the applicable standards and
requirements of this chapter (i.e.the subdivision and development of such lot(s) require no
further review by the Board); and (ii) the application specifies (as a proposed condition on the
CUP) the use or uses, maximum height, and maximum floor area of any structure(s) allowed
on each lot for which the application does not provide sufficient information to allow
development approval by the Board.(AMENDED 10/23/18)
(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 15-64(d), with respect to lots for
which the application for a CUP for the entire tract does not provide sufficient
information to allow development approval of such lots by the Board, the Board
shall specify (by way of a condition upon the CUP) whether development
approval of such lots shall be regarded as an insignificant deviation or a minor
modification, or shall require a new application. In making this determination, the
Board shall consider the extent to which the initial CUP imposes limitations on
the use and design of each such lot beyond the minimum requirements of this
section. The Board’s determination as to the type of approval of such lots shall
apply only to applications that are consistent with the permi t previous ly
approved by the Boa rd. Such appl icat ions may be submitted by persons
who have an interest (as described in Section 15-48) only in such lots, rather
than the developer of the entire tract zoned B-4-CZ.
(2) Except as provided in subdivision (1) above, the provisions of Section 15-64
and Subsection 15-141.4 shall apply to proposed changes to a CUP
issued in connection with a B-4-CZ rezoning.
Section 15-141.5 Site Specific, Flexible Zoning District (AMENDED 06/21/16)
(a) A site specific, flexible zoning district (FLX) may be established in accordance with
the provisions of this section. The purpose of such a district is to establish detailed
standards for alternative possibilities for the development of a specific tract of land,
thereby facilitating the development of that property according to the demands of the
market, but in a way that is consistent with sound planning and the promotion of the
public health, safety, and welfare.
(b) To be considered for FLX zoning, a tract must (i) be at least twenty-five acres in size,
(ii) be, as a whole, owned by or under control or option to be purchased by one or more
individuals or entities, (iii) be located adjacent to a major arterial such that, when developed, the
principal entrance to such development will be from that arterial, (iv) have been the subject of a
site specific planning study by the Town to determine the most appropriate potential
development options for such tract. As used herein, the term “site specific planning study” shall
mean a collaborative programmatic and design study for the site performed either by, or with the
participation of the Town and input from one or more workshops, which shall result in a
narrative report and conceptual master plan describing in general terms how the site might be
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #29
developed and how the conceptual master plan corresponds to and addresses applicable
components of all town plans for the area, and applicable conditions, and (v) be located in an
area that is subject to an adopted small area plan.
(1) If the Town receives a request for FLX zoning for a tract that has not been the
subject of a site specific planning study as described in Subsection (b)(iv)
above, the Planning Director shall present to the Board of Aldermen a
proposal for undertaking such a study before accepting a formal application
for the rezoning. If the Board of Aldermen accepts the proposal, the site
specific planning study shall proceed as described in the following subsections,
or as otherwise directed by the Board.
a. The site specific planning study shall be structured as a charrette
of a minimum of one day in duration, or more as determined by
the Board.
b. The Town shall contract a design professional, with no ties to the
applicant, to conduct the charrette. The Town may also contract with
a qualified facilitator to oversee the charrette process and final reports
prepared from the charrette process.
c. Participation shall include representatives from advisory boards,
neighbors, and members of the public.
d. Notice of the date of the charrette will be mailed to residents and
property owners within 1000 feet of the subject property, published in
the newspaper as well and any other means the Town deems suitable.
(2) Findings from the site specific planning study report, or narrative, and site plan(s)
shall be presented to the Board of Aldermen. Subsequent requests for FLX zoning
shall demonstrate compliance with the findings from the site specific planning
study.
(3) If more than five years have elapsed since the findings from the site specific
planning study were presented to the Board and the circumstances relating to the
study have substantially changed, the Board may request an update to the study
before accepting a request for FLX zoning. Examples of substantial changes in
circumstances include but are not limited to: annexation, some or all of the tract
has been subject to a rezoning, unrelated to the FLX district, that increases
residential density or changes the types of uses, (i.e. residential to commercial),
development on surrounding properties has changed the character or capacity of
existing infrastructure.
(c) A FLX zoning district shall address the following:
(1) The types of uses that are permissible within the FLX district, along with a
maximum (and if applicable, a minimum) percentage of the gross land area that will
be devoted to each such use. The description of uses may be in reference to the use
classification numbers set forth in the Table of Permissible Uses, or the uses may
otherwise be described. The district regulations may also establish density or intensity
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #30
limitations (expressed in terms of a maximum and/or, if applicable, a minimum
number of dwelling units or square feet of building floor area, and applicable ratios, if
any if different types of uses within the district).
(2) The dimensional restrictions (building height, minimum lot size, setbacks) that
shall apply throughout the district. Different restrictions may apply to different
portions of the district, depending on the uses located therein. The dimensional
restrictions may be described by reference to those applicable within particular
zoning districts, or otherwise.
(3) Any limitations on the areas within the district where particular types of uses may
be allowed.
(4) Any architectural standards that will apply to all or designated portions of the
district.
(5) Any limitations on the timing or sequence of development of various portions of
the district.
(6) The location of entrances to and exits from the tract zoned FLX.
(7) The manner in which the development of the property will comply with the
stormwater requirements set forth in Article XVI, Part II. All developed lots within
the district shall be subject to these standards, regardless of the amount of land
disturbance, but the FLX district may allow the necessary stormwater treatment
facilities to be constructed to meet these standards on a lot by lot basis, or some other
basis that provides effective and efficient treatment for all new construction.
(8) Any limitations on the location or design of parking lots and facilities.
(9) Specifications and standards for the internal circulation system serving vehicular
and pedestrian traffic, including a statement as to whether such facilities will be
dedicated to the Town.
(10) All infrastructure improvements proposed to be constructed in conjunction with
the development of the property zoned FLX (including but not limited to
improvements to adjoining streets) together with a schedule that links construction of
such improvements to the development of the property.
(10A) A traffic impact analysis of the FLX zone, including a phase plan or schedule
of improvements along with a description of thresholds to require improvements.
(11) The extent to which, and the manner in which, development within the tract
zoned FLX will be required to meet the goals of Low Impact Design and or exceed
the standards for LEED gold certification.
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #31
(d) Development of any lot within a FLX zoning district shall require a zoning permit
(and a sign permit if applicable), but not a special or conditional use permit.
(e) All relevant provisions of the Land Use Ordinance shall apply except to the extent
that such provisions are superseded by the provisions of this section or any FLX
district established pursuant to this section. In the case of conflict, the provisions of
this ordinance or of the specific FLX district ordinance for the tract shall apply.
(f) A text amendment establishing a FLX district as well as a map amendment applying
such district to a particular tract shall be initiated and processed in accordance with
the following provisions:
(1) The owner of property who wishes to have such property zoned FLX shall
submit a written request to the Board of Aldermen, identifying the subject
property and explaining why the property is a good candidate for FLX
zoning. This written request shall include or attach (i) relevant documents
(i.e. narrative, and site plan(s) and a list of proposed conditions which may
be in the form of written statements, graphic illustrations, or any
combination thereof) that describe the results of the site specific planning
process referred to in subsection (b)(iv) above, and (ii) an explanation as
to why and how the proposed district is consistent with the Northern Study
Area Plan, or if the property is not located within the Northern Study
Area, such other plans or policies as may be applicable. The Board may,
in its discretion, summarily deny the request or direct the town attorney
and planning staff to work with the property owner to develop an
ordinance pursuant to this section that establishes an appropriate FLX
district and that applies this district to such property.
(2) Once an ordinance has been drafted as provided in subdivision (f)(1), such
ordinance shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of Article
XX of this chapter applicable to ordinance amendments initiated by the
town administration, except that (i) a preliminary draft of the ordinance,
including a concept plan shall be presented to the planning board,
Transportation Advisory Board, Environmental Advisory Board,
Appearance Commission, Economic Sustainability Commission, and
Northern Transition Area Advisory Committee (and other advisory boards
to which the Board of Aldermen may refer the draft) prior to the ordinance
being referred to the Board of Aldermen to establish a date for the legally
required public hearing on the ordinance; (ii) at the time the Board of
Aldermen directs that an ordinance be drafted in accordance with
subsection (f)(1) above, the Board may establish such additional processes
as deemed necessary to ensure that the public has an adequate opportunity
for input into the proposed FLX district, and (iii) no property shall be
rezoned FLX without the consent of the property owner (which consent
Art. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP
Page #32
may be withdrawn at any time before the adoption of the ordinance
establishing the FLX district). The text and the map amendment may be
processed simultaneously.
(3) Amendments to a FLX district shall be initiated and processed in the same
manner as the initial ordinance, except that, if the planning staff
determines that a proposed amendment has no substantial impact on
neighboring properties, the general public, or those intended to occupy the
site zoned FLX, the staff may forward the requested amendment to the
Board as provided in subsection 15-321(c)(2). In such case, the Board
may (i) decline to call for a public hearing on the proposed amendment,
thereby rejecting it; (ii) establish a date for a public hearing on the
proposed amendment in accordance with the procedures applicable to any
other zoning amendment; or (iii) direct that additional processes be
followed to obtain additional public input on the proposal before setting a
date for the legally required public hearing.
(g) Property within a FLX district may be subdivided according to the provisions of this
chapter applicable to minor subdivisions, even if such subdivision involves the
creation of more than a total of four lots or the creation of a new public street.
PART II. ZONING MAP
Section 15-142 Official Zoning Map.
(a) There shall be a map known and designated as the Official Zoning Map, which shall

means that tracts developed with four dwelling units or less require a zoning permit, tracts developed with
between five and twelve dwelling units require a special use permit, and tracts developed with more than
twelve dwelling units require a conditional use permit. When used in connection with single-family,
two-family, and multi-family residences in the watershed districts, the designation “ZC” means that tracts

square feet of new building gross floor area or the development is located on a lot of more than one acre,
and a zoning permit must be obtained if the development involves the construction of 3,000 square feet or
less of new building gross floor area and the development is located on a lot of one acre or less.
(AMENDED 11/14/88) (REWRITTEN 4/23/13)
(e) Subject to Section 15-148, use of the designation “ZS” means that a zoning permit must
be obtained if the development is located on a lot of two acres or less while a special use permit must be

(h) Whenever any 1.000 classification use is proposed for a lot in the R-2, R-3, R-7.5, and
R-10 zoning districts and such use would otherwise require the issuance of a zoning
permit under the provisions of this section, a special use permit shall nevertheless be
required if:
(1) The use involves (i) construction of an addition to an existing dwelling, or (ii)
construction of an additional dwelling on a lot where at least one dwelling
already exists, or (iii) construction of a dwelling on a lot from which a
previously existing dwelling has been removed within a period of three years

square feet.
(3) This requirement shall not apply if at least one of the dwelling units is an
affordable housing unit as defined in Section 15-182.4(a).
(4) This requirement shall not apply with respect to a proposed one-time addition to
a dwelling that has been in existence for a period of at least twenty years if such
one-time addition results in less than a 25 percent increase in the gross floor area
of such dwelling and less than a 15 percent increase in the gross floor area of all
dwellings covered by the proposed permit.
(i) When used in connection with 8.100, 8.200, 8.500 and 8.600 uses, the designation

purpose is equal to or exceeds 1,500 square feet.
(j) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, whenever a building of more than
two stories or 35 feet in height is proposed within the B-1(g), B-1(c), B-2, CT or M-1

service provider facilities shall be determined by the supplementary use regulations in Section 15-
176.6. (AMENDED 06/23/15)
o) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the designation “Z” opposite use classification 3.260 is
subject to the qualification that use classification 3.260 may only be allowed with a zoning permit in
conjunction with the conditional rezoning of a property and demonstration of compliance with all
applicable Land Use Ordinance provisions, including supplementary use regulations in section
15.176.7. (AMENDED 03/22/16)

r) When used in conjunction with 8.800 uses, the designation “Z, C” means that a zoning
permit must be obtained if the performing arts space development is located on a property
located in that portion of the B-1(g) or B-1(c) zoning districts and is located 150 feet or more from the
nearest building containing a residential use. A conditional use permit must be obtained if the
development is located on a property that is located within portions of the B-1(g) or B-1(c) zoning
districts. The measurement is made from the building containing the main performance space to the
nearest existing off-site building containing a residential use. (AMENDED 11/27/2018)
s) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the permit requirement for use classification 17.200

permit shall become null and void. (AMENDED 10/22/2019)
Section 15-148 Board of Adjustment Jurisdiction Over Uses Otherwise Permissible With a
Zoning Permit.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, whenever the Table of Permissible
Uses (interpreted in the light of Section 15-147 and the other provisions of this article) provides that a use
is permissible with a zoning permit, (i) a conditional use permit shall nevertheless be required if the
administrator finds that the proposed use is located within the University Lake Watershed (i.e., the C, B-5,
and WM-3 districts) and would have a substantial impact on neighboring properties or the general public,
and (ii) a conditional use permit shall nevertheless be required if the administrator finds that the proposed
use is located in the B-1(c), B-1(g), B-2, or CT zoning districts, the use is shown as permissible in those
districts with a “ZC” designation in the Table of Permissible Uses, and the proposed use would have a
substantial impact on neighboring properties or the general public; (iii) otherwise, a special use permit
shall nevertheless be required if the administrator finds that the proposed use would have a substantial
impact on neighboring properties or the general public. (AMENDED 01/22/85; 12/15/87; 02/25/92)
(b) A special use permit shall be required for any use that is otherwise permissible with a
zoning permit if the administrator concludes that, given the impact of the proposed use on neighboring
properties, the vested right conferred upon the permit recipient pursuant to Section 15-128.2 should not be
conferred without an opportunity for public input. A conditional use permit shall be required for any use
that is otherwise permissible with a zoning permit if the administrator concludes that, given the impact of
the proposed use on the general public, the vested right conferred upon the permit recipient pursuant to
Section 15-128.2 should not be conferred without an opportunity for public input. However, if the zoning
administrator makes this determination, the permit applicant may require that the application be returned
to the zoning permit process by submitting to the administrator a written waiver of the vested right
normally acquired under Section 15-128.2 upon the issuance of a zoning permit. (AMENDED 10/01/91;

(a) The presumption established by this chapter is that all legitimate uses of land are
permissible within at least one zoning district in the town’s planning jurisdiction. Therefore, because the
list of permissible uses set forth in Section 15-146 (Table of Permissible Uses) cannot be all-inclusive,
those uses that are listed shall be interpreted liberally to include other uses that have similar impacts to the
listed uses.
(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), all uses that are not listed in Section 15-146 (Table of
Permissible Uses), even given the liberal interpretation mandated by subsection (a), are prohibited. Nor
shall Section 15-146 (Table of Permissible Uses) be interpreted to allow a use in one zoning district when
the use in question is more closely related to another specified use that is permissible in other zoning
districts.
(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions, the following uses are
specifically prohibited in all districts:
(1) Any use that involves the manufacture, handling, sale, distribution, or storage of
any highly combustible or explosive materials in violation of the fire prevention
code adopted by reference in Section 12-11 of the Town Code.
(2) Stockyards, slaughterhouses, rendering plants.
(3) Use of a travel trailer as a residence, temporary or permanent.
(4) The use of any motor vehicle (as defined in Section 6-1 of the Town
Code), parked on a lot, as a structure in which, out of which, or from
which any goods are sold or stored, any services performed, or other
businesses conducted (as defined in Section 8-1 of the Town Code),
except that the following shall not be prohibited by this subdivision: (i)
retail sales of goods and food products manufactured, created or
produced by the seller, (ii) the sale of food products on town property by
persons authorized or acting on behalf of the town; (iii) the sale of
prepared food by mobile prepared food vendors to the extent authorized
in the Table of Permissible Uses and Section 15-176.5; and (iv) use of a
motor vehicle in connection with an aluminum recycling operation to the
extent authorized in the Table of Permissible Uses and other provisions
of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,
situations that exist on the effective date of this provision that are in
violation thereof shall not be regarded as lawful, nonconforming
situations thirty days after the effective date of this subdivision.

Art. X PERMISSIBLE USES (con’t)

(5) Construction by the developer of a major residential subdivision of an opaque
fence, wall, or berm more than three feet in height around any portion of the
periphery of such subdivision, except where such fence, wall or berm is designed
to shield the residents of such subdivision from the adverse effects of any
adjoining nonresidential use other than a street. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
a berm of more than three but less than four feet in height shall be allowed under
the foregoing circumstances where (i) the side slopes of the berm are constructed
at a steepness ratio of 4:1 to 6:1 and (ii) the average height of the berm does not
exceed three feet. For purposes of this subsection, the term “developer” includes
any entity that is under the control of the developer, including a homeowners
association that is under the developer’s control. (AMENDED 05/19/98,
08/24/99)
(6) Construction of gates that prevent access to private roads serving five or more
lots or dwelling units. (AMENDED 05/25/99)
Section 15-150 Accessory Uses.
(a) The Table of Permissible Uses (Section 15-146) classifies different principal uses
according to their different impacts. Whenever an activity (which may or may not be separately listed as
a principal use in this table) is conducted in conjunction with another principal use and the former use (i)
constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on a lot, or (ii) is
commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to it, then the former use may be
regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit
issued for the principal use. For example, a service station (use classification 9.200) is permissible in a
B-3 district; car washes (9.500) are not. However, many service stations have facilities for washing cars.
If such car washing activities are incidental to the principal use, then they may be regarded as accessory to
the principal use and a service station with such facilities would be permissible in a B-3 district.
However, if the car washing operations are substantial (e.g., if separate from the main building or if there
are two or more bays used principally or solely for car washing), then the total operation would be
considered a combination use consisting of a service station principal use and a car wash principal use.
This combination use would not be permitted within a B-3 district. As another example, a swimming
pool/tennis court complex is customarily associated with and integrally related to a residential subdivision
or multi-family development and would be regarded as accessory to such principal uses, even though such
facilities, if developed (as use classification 6.210 or 6.220) apart from a residential development, would
require a special use permit or conditional use permit. (AMENDED 02/02/88)
(b) For purposes of interpreting subsection (a):
(1) A use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is incidental or
insubstantial in and of itself or in relation to the principal use;
Art. X PERMISSIBLE USES (con’t)
13
(2) To be “commonly associated” with a principal use it is not necessary for an
accessory use to be connected with such principal use more times than not, but
only that the association of such accessory use with such principal use takes place
with sufficient frequency that there is common acceptance of their relatedness.
(c) Without limiting the generality of subsections (a) and (b), the following activities are
specifically regarded as accessory to residential principal uses so long as they satisfy the general criteria
set forth above:
(1) Offices or studios within an enclosed building and used by an occupant of a
residence located on the same lot as such building to carry on administrative or
artistic activities of a commercial nature, so long as such activities do not fall
within the definition of a home occupation.
(2) Hobbies or recreational activities of a noncommercial nature.
(3) The renting out of one or two rooms within a single-family residence (which one
or two rooms do not themselves constitute a separate dwelling unit) to not more
than two persons who are not part of the family that resides in the single-family
dwelling.
(4) Yard sales or garage sales, so long as such sales are not conducted on the same lot
for more than three days (whether consecutive or not) during any 90-day period.
(AMENDED 4/27/82)
(5) Towers and antennas constructed on residential property, as long as:
a. Such towers are intended for the personal and noncommercial use of the
residents of the property where located; and
b. Such towers and antennas comply with the setback requirements of
Subsection 15-176(2) and are installed only in rear or side yards; and
c. No more than one such tower or antenna may be regarded as an accessory
use on a single lot; and
d. The owner must be able to demonstrate compliance with Federal
Communications Commission regulations, 47 C.F.R. Part 97, Subpart
97.15, Sections (a) through (e), inclusive; and

(d) Without limiting the generality of subsections (a) and (b), the following
activities are regarded as accessory to residential and commercial principal uses so long
as they satisfy the general criteria set forth above. (AMENDED 06/27/17)
(1) Solar Arrays, and solar water heaters, providing energy for the
principal use on the property, in any zoning district.
(2) The applicant must be able to demonstrate ownership of the subject
property or permission by the owner to install the solar device.
(3) The applicant must prepare and submit a site plan or sketch plan
showing the following:
a. Installation of the array(s) shall not negatively affect
compliance, or any condition of compliance of an existing land
use permit or building permit.
b. The panels are designed, positioned, and oriented such that
concentrated solar radiation or glare shall not be directed onto
nearby properties or road rights-of-way, or shall otherwise
create a safety hazard.
c. All on-site utility lines shall be placed underground.
d. The top of any roof mounted devices, located on the principal
structure or any accessory structure, shall not exceed the
maximum building height for the district in accordance with
Section 15-185.
e. Ground mounted systems shall not exceed a maximum
height of 15 feet from finished grade to the top of the device.
1. The installation of the solar device and associated
mechanical equipment shall not affect tree screening or buffer
requirements outlined in Article XIX.
2. Mechanical equipment, including batteries or other
similar storage devices, shall be located within the required
building setbacks as provided for in Section 15-184, and shall
be shielded to avoid damage.
3. All solar devices and mechanical equipment, including
batteries or other similar storage devices, shall be located outside of the
designated open space, well/septic system areas as identified by

(e) Without listing the generality of subsections (a) and (b), the following activities shall not
be regarded as accessory to a residential principal use and are prohibited in residential districts:
(1) Parking outside a substantially enclosed structure of more than four motor vehicles
between the front building line of the principal building and the street on any lot
used for purposes that fall within the following principal use classifications: 1.100,
1.200, 1.420, or 1.430.
(f) Satellite dishes shall be regarded as accessory uses to any residential or non-residential
principal use. However, as set forth in the Table of Permissible Uses, Cable Television Satellite stations
shall be regarded as a separate principal use (use classification 17.300). (AMENDED 02/18/97)
(g) On property that is residentially zoned (SEE Section 15-135), a temporary family health
care structure shall be regarded as an accessory use to a single-family detached dwelling to the extent
authorized and in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 160A-383.5 (S.L. 2014-94). (AMENDED
03/24/15)
Section 15-151 Permissible Uses Not Requiring Permits (AMENDED 06/06/89)
(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no zoning, special use, or
conditional use permit is necessary for the following uses:
(1) Electric power, telephone, telegraph, cable television, gas, water and sewer lines,
wires or pipes, together with supporting poles or structures, located within a public
right-of-way.
(2) Neighborhood utility facilities located within a public right-of-way with the
permission of the owner (state or town) of the right-of-way, so long as such
facilities do not exceed five feet in height, five feet in width, or five feet in depth.
(AMENDED 05/26/81)
(3) Bus shelters erected by or under the direction of the town. (AMENDED 01/22/85)
(4) Space occupied by the Town of Carrboro police department within pre-existing
buildings for purposes of allowing police officers to spend time periodically

(AMENDED 04/18/95)
(b) As described in Section 15-84(b), construction plans for new electric power, telephone,
telegraph, cable television, gas, water, and sewer lines, wires or pipes, together with supporting poles or
structures, located within a public right-of-way shall be submitted to and approved by the public works
director before construction of such facilities may commence. (AMENDED 06/06/89)
Section 15-152 Change in Use.
(a) A substantial change in use of property occurs whenever the essential character or nature
of the activity conducted on a lot changes. This occurs whenever:
(1) The change involves a change from one principal use category to another.
(2) If the original use is a combination use (27.000) or planned unit development
(28.000), the relative proportion of space devoted to the individual principal uses
that comprise the combination use or planned unit development use changes to
such an extent that the parking requirements for the overall use are altered.
(3) If the original use is a combination use or planned unit development use, the
mixture of types of individual principal uses that comprise the combination use or
planned unit development use changes.
(4) (DELETED 10/22/91)
(b) A mere change in the status of property from unoccupied to occupied or vice-versa does
not constitute a change in use. Whether a change in use occurs shall be determined by comparing the two
active uses of the property without regard to any intervening period during with the property may have
been unoccupied, unless the property has remained unoccupied for more than twelve consecutive months.
(AMENDED 06/18/91)
(c) A mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise shall not be regarded as a change
in use.
Section 15-153 Developments in the B-3 Zoning District.
The 2.000, 3.000, and 4.000 classifications in the Table of Permissible Uses are written in very
broad terms. However, it is the intention of this chapter that uses described in those classifications are
permissible in an area zoned B-3 only when the particular use is in accordance with the objectives of the
B- 3 zoning district set forth in Section 15-136. (AMENDED 5/26/81)
Art. X PERMISSIBLE USES (con’t)
17
Section 15-154 Combination Uses.
(a) When a combination use comprises two or more principal uses that require different types
of permits (zoning, special use, or conditional use), then the permit authorizing the combination use shall
be:
(1) A conditional use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a
conditional use permit.
(2) A special use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a special use
permit but none requires a conditional use permit.
(3) A zoning permit in all other cases.
This is indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses by the designation “Z,S,C” in each of the columns
adjacent to the 27.000 classification.
(b) Subject to subsection (c), when a combination use consists of a residential subdivision and
a multi-family development the total density permissible on the developer’s tract shall be determined by
having the developer indicate on the plans the portion of the total tract that will be developed for each
purpose and calculating the density for each portion as if it were a separate lot. (AMENDED 11/26/85)
(c) Notwithstanding Subsection 15-182(b), whenever (i) a combination use consists of a
standard residential subdivision and a multi-family development and (ii) the subdivided portion of the
tract contains lots that exceed the minimum lot size requirements set forth in Section 15-181, but that do
not exceed an average of 30,000 square feet, then the density of the portion of the tract developed for
multi-family purposes may be increased beyond the permissible density calculated in accordance with
subsection (b). The increase in density shall be determined as follows: (AMENDED 11/26/85)
(1) The minimum lot size requirement for the applicable zoning district shall be
subtracted from each lot that exceeds the minimum lot size, and the remainders
totaled.
(2) The sum derived from the calculation in subdivision (1) shall be divided by the
minimum lot size requirements. Fractions shall be rounded to the nearest whole
number.
(3) The result of the calculation in subdivision (2) shall yield the number of additional
multi-family dwelling units that may be located within the portion of the tract
developed for multi-family purposes.
Art. X PERMISSIBLE USES (con’t)
18
(d) When a residential use is combined with a non-residential use in a business district, the lot
must have at least the minimum square footage required for the residential use alone. For example, in a
B-1 zone, if two dwelling units are combined with a retail store in one building, the lot must have at least
6,000 square feet.
(e) When two principal uses are combined, the total amount of parking required for the
combination use shall be determined by cumulating the amount of parking required for each individual
principal use according to the relative amount of space occupied by that use.
Section 15-155 Planned Unit Developments.
(a) In a planned unit development the developer may make use of the land for any purpose
authorized in the particular PUD zoning district in which the land is located, subject to the provisions of
this chapter. Section 15-139 describes the various types of PUD zoning districts.
(b) Within any lot developed as a planned unit development, not more than ten percent of the
total lot area may be developed for purposes that are permissible only in a B-1(g), B-2, or B-3 zoning
district (whichever corresponds to the PUD zoning district in question), and not more than five percent of
the total lot area may be developed for uses permissible only in the M-1 zoning district (assuming the
PUD zoning district allows such uses at all).
(c) The plans for the proposed planned unit development shall indicate the particular portions
of the lot that the developer intends to develop for purposes permissible in a residential district (as
applicable), purposes permissible in a business district (as applicable), and purposes permissible only in
an M-1 district (as applicable). For purposes of determining the substantive regulations that apply to the
planned unit development, each portion of the lot so designated shall then be treated as if it were a
separate district, zoned to permit, respectively, residential, business or M-1 uses. However, only one
permit--a planned unit development permit--shall be issued for the entire development.
(d) The nonresidential portions of any planned unit development may not be occupied until all
of the residential portions of the development are completed or their completion is assured by any of the
mechanisms provided in Article IV to guarantee completion. The purpose and intent of this provision is
to ensure that the planned unit development procedure is not used, intentionally or unintentionally, to
create nonresidential uses in areas generally zoned for residential uses except as part of an integrated and
well-planned, primarily residential, development.
Section 15-156 More Specific Use Controls.
Whenever a development could fall within more than one use classification in the Table of
Permissible Uses (Section 15-146), the classification that most closely and most specifically describes the
development controls. For example, a small doctor’s office or clinic clearly falls within the 3.110
classification (office and service operations conducted entirely indoors and designed to attract customers
Art. X PERMISSIBLE USES (con’t)
19
or clients to the premises). However, classification 3.130 “Physicians and dentists offices and clinics
occupying not more than 10,000 square feet of gross floor area” more specifically covers this use and
therefore is controlling.
Section 15-157 Residential Uses in Conservation Districts.
The Table of Permissible uses indicates that single family residences are permissible in the
conservation district. However, this shall be true only if and to the extent a residence is used in
conjunction with another permitted use, e.g., a caretaker’s house. (AMENDED 12/7/83)
Section 15-158 Hazardous Substances in B-5 and WM-3 Districts (AMENDED 12/7/83)
(a) Subject to subsection (b), no use involving the possession, storage, maintenance, or use of
any quantity of hazardous substance shall be permissible on any lot within the B- 5 or WM-3 zoning
districts. (AMENDED 06/21/88)
(b) Subsection (a) shall not apply to commercial or industrial enterprises which:
(1) use, possess, store, or maintain gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel, and other petroleum
products where such products are held solely for the purpose of on-premises sales
to retail customers; however, storage tanks for such products must be emptied
within sixty days after sale of the products stored is discontinued;
(2) use, possess, store, or maintain hazardous substances contained in consumer
products packaged and held for retail sale to the general public;
(3) use, possess, store, or maintain hazardous substances contained in commercial
products used for janitorial or maintenance purposes on the premises where stored.
(4) are in possession, on June 21, 1988 of a Hazardous Substances Authorization
Certificate issued under the prior subsection (c) of this section; to the extent that
such enterprises use, possession, storage, or maintenance of hazardous chemicals
is substantially the same as was the case on the date of issuance of such Certificate.
This exemption is transferable with the transfer of the enterprise in question only
to the extent that the new enterprise will operate substantially the same operation
at the same location as that for which the Certificate was issued. (AMENDED
06/21/88)
(c) Notwithstanding the provision of Article VIII of this chapter, situations that exist on the
effective date of this section that are made non-conforming by this section shall not be allowed to

Section 15-160 Outside Display of Goods in B-1(c) and B-1(g), and WM-3 Districts (AMENDED
2/4/86; 10/28/08)
(a) As indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses, outside display of goods for sale or rent, but
not outside storage, is permitted in the B-1(c), B-1(g) and WM-3 zoning districts. However, such outside
display shall only be allowed if and to the extent that:
(1) Such display is conducted in furtherance of a business operated on such the lot
where the display is located, by the person operating such business; and
(2) Such display is conducted on a lot on which is located a principal building that
houses the businesses referenced in subdivision (1); and
(3) For lots located within the B-1(c) and B-1(g) districts, the area of such display
does not exceed 25% of the gross floor area of the principal building referenced as
subdivision (2) that is occupied by the business referenced in subdivision (1). For
lots located within the WM-3 district the total area of such display does not exceed
5% of the gross floor area of the principal building, the display must be located
outside of all required setbacks and areas landscaped to meet screening and
shading requirements, and the display must be removed or adequately secured
when the business operating on the lot is closed.
(b) For purposes of this section, the term “lot” shall include all contiguous land as well
as land immediately on the opposite side of a bisecting street that is in the possession or
under the control of the person operating the business referenced in subdivision (a)(1).

ARTICLE XI
SUPPLEMENTARY USE REGULATIONS
PART I. NON-RESIDENTIAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
Section 15-161 “Good Neighbor” Performance Standards for Non-Residential Uses.
(AMENDED 10/20/92; 04/15/97, 05/25/99)
The provisions of this part are designed to provide performance standards by which
applications for non-residential development will be evaluated by the town and by which the actual
performance of those operations and uses will be monitored by the town for compliance. The
purposes of these performance standards are to protect the town in general, and abutting and
neighboring landowners in particular, from any potential negative impacts that new nonresidential
uses may have on the physical environment and on the quality of life currently enjoyed by the
residents of Carrboro’s planning jurisdiction.
Section 15-162 Smoke, Dust, Fumes, Vapors, Gases, and Odors (AMENDED 05/25/99)
(a) Emission of smoke, dust, dirt, fly ash, or other particulate matter, or of noxious, toxic
or corrosive fumes, vapors, or gases in such quantities as to be evident or perceptible at the property
line of any lot on which a use is conducted, or which could be injurious to human health, animals, or
vegetation, or which could be detrimental to the enjoyment of adjoining or nearby properties, or which
could soil or stain persons or property, at any point beyond the lot line of the commercial or industrial
establishment creating that emission shall be prohibited.
(b) No use shall be permitted to produce harmful, offensive, or bothersome odors, scents,
or aromas (such as, but not limited to, those produced by manufacturing processes, food preparation,
food processing, fish sales, rendering, fermentation processes, decaying organic matter, and
incinerators) perceptible beyond the property line of the lot where such use is located either at ground
level or any habitable elevation.
(c) The location and vertical height of all exhaust fans, vents, chimneys, or any other
sources discharging or emitting smoke, fumes, gases, vapors, odors, scents or aromas shall be shown
on the application plans, with a description of the source materials.
Section 15-163 Noise (AMENDED 6/22/04)
(a) No 4.000, 9.400, or 2.150 classification use in any permissible business or PID district
may generate noise that tends to have an annoying or disruptive effect upon (i) uses located outside the
immediate space occupied by the 4.000 or 9.400 use if that use is one of several located on a lot, or (ii)
uses located on adjacent lots. Noises that exceed the levels set forth below shall be deemed annoying
or disruptive. Low frequency noises shall be considered annoying and disruptive if they exceed the
decibel levels set forth below when measured without using an A-weighted filter, or if such noises
generate a perceptible vibration within structures located beyond the boundaries referenced above.
(AMENDED 6/22/82; 10/20/92; 05/25/99)
(b) Except as provided in subsection (f), the table set forth in subsection (e) establishes the
maximum permissible noise levels for 4.000 classification uses in the M-1 and M-2 districts.
Measurements shall be taken at the boundary line of the lot where the 4.000 classification use is
2
located, and, as indicated, the maximum permissible noise levels vary according to the zoning of the
lot adjacent to the lot on which the 4.000 classification use is located.
(c) A decibel is a measure of a unit of sound pressure. Since sound waves having the
same decibel level “sound” louder or softer to the human ear depending upon the frequency of the
sound wave in cycles per second (i.e., whether the pitch of the sound is high or low) an A-weighted
filter constructed in accordance with the specifications of the American National Standards Institute,
which automatically takes account of the varying effect on the human ear of different pitches, shall be
used on any sound level meter taking measurements required by this section. And accordingly, all
measurements are expressed in dB(A) to reflect the use of this A-weighted filter.
(d) The standards established in the table set forth in subsection (e) are expressed in terms
of the Equivalent Sound Level (Leq), which must be calculated by taking 100 instantaneous
A-weighted sound levels at ten second intervals (see Appendix F-1) and computing the Leq in
accordance with the table set forth in Appendix F-2.

(f) Impact noises are sounds that occur intermittently rather than continuously. Impact
noises generated by sources that do not operate more than one minute in any one hour period are
3
permissible up to a level of 10 dbA in excess of the figure listed in subsection (e), except that this
higher level of permissible noise shall not apply from 7:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M. when the adjacent lot is
zoned residential. The impact noise shall be measured using the fast response of the sound level
meter.
(g) Noise resulting from temporary construction activity that occurs between 7:00 A.M.
and 7:00 P.M. shall be exempt from the requirements of this section.
(h) The operation of dry cleaning machinery in the B-3 zoning district, including but not
limited to steam boilers, vacuum units, steamers, dry cleaning machines, pressing machines and air
compressors, shall not be permissible outside of the hours between 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Monday
through Friday, 12:00 noon and 5: 00 p.m. on Saturday, if and to the extent that such operation
results in noise that is audible at the property line of the lot on which the business operating such
machinery is located. Any business that is not in compliance with this provision shall be required
to bring their dry cleaning operations into compliance within 90 days of the effective date of this
ordinance.
Section 15-164 Vibration.
(a) No 4.000, 9.400, or 2.150 classification use in any permissible business or PID district
may generate any ground transmitted vibration that is perceptible to the human sense of touch
measured at (i) the outside boundary of the immediate space occupied by the enterprise generating the
vibration if the enterprise is one of several located on a lot, or (ii) the lot line if the enterprise
generating the vibration is the only enterprise located on the lot. (AMENDED 6/22/82; 10/20/92;
05/15/97)
(b) No 4.000 classification use in an M-1 or M-2 district may generate any groundtransmitted
vibration in excess of the limits set forth in subsection (e). Vibration shall be measured at
any adjacent lot line or residential district line as indicated in the table set forth in subsection (d).

(15) REPEALED (11/19/13)
(16) In addition to the considerations for conditional or special use permits found in
Section 15-54 of this ordinance, the approving bodies in determining whether a
tower is in harmony with the area of a tower on the value of adjoining or abutting
properties may consider the aesthetic effects of the tower as well as mitigating
factors concerning aesthetics, and may disapprove a tower on the grounds that
15
such aesthetic effects are unacceptable. Factors relevant to aesthetic effects are
the protection of the view in sensitive or particularly scenic areas and areas
specially designated in adopted plans such as unique natural features, scenic
roadways and historic sites; the concentration of towers in the proposed areas;
and whether the height, design, placement or other characteristics of the
proposed tower could be modified to have a less intrusive impact.
(b) A request for a modification of an existing cell tower or base station that involves
the collocation of new transmission equipment or the removal or replacement of
transmission equipment but that does not substantially change the physical dimensions of
the cell tower or base station shall be approved by the administrator as an insignificant
deviation (see Section 15-64). For purposes of this section, a substantial change in physical
dimensions would occur if: (AMENDED 11/19/13)
(1) The proposed antenna would increase the existing height of the tower by more
than 10%, or by the height of one additional antenna array with separation from
the nearest existing antenna not to exceed twenty feet, whichever is greater (may
exceed these size limits if necessary to avoid interference with existing
antennas);
(2) The proposed antenna would involve the installation of more than the standard
number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved, not to exceed
four, or more than one new equipment shelter;
(3) The proposed antenna would involve adding an appurtenance to the body of the
tower that would protrude from the edge of the tower more than twenty feet, or
more than the width of the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance,
whichever is greater (may exceed these size limits if necessary to shelter the
antenna from inclement weather or connect the antenna to the tower via cable;
OR
(4) The proposed antenna would involve excavation outside the current tower site,
defined as the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding
the tower and any access or utility easements currently related to the site.
(5) The proposed change would enlarge the square footage of the existing equipment
compound by more than 2,500 square feet.
(c) The Town shall have 45 days within which to determine the completeness of an
application for a collocation or eligible facilities request, and then 45 days from the date that
the application is determined to be complete within which to make its decision. An
application is deemed to be complete 45 days after it is submitted unless the Town
determines, and notifies the applicant in writing within 45 days of submission, that (and
how) the application is deficient. The Town shall have 150 days within which to decide all
other types of applications relating to cell towers. (AMENDED 11/19/13)

the entrance of the stacking lane.
Section 15-176.2 Village Mixed Use Developments (AMENDED 05/25/99; 05/28/02)
(a) In a village mixed use development, a maximum of ten percent of the total gross
acreage of the tract, or five acres, whichever is less, may be used for purposes permissible in the B-3T
or OA districts, subject to any conditions or limitations (including limitations on the types of
permissible uses) contained in the remaining provisions of this section, the Master Plan, or the
conditional use permit that authorizes the development in question.
(1) Within the portion of the tract developed for commercial purposes, the
regulations (other than use regulations, which are governed by the provisions
immediately above) applicable to property zoned B-3T shall apply except as
otherwise provided in this section or as otherwise allowed by the Board of
Aldermen in the approval of the Master Plan or conditional use permit for the
development.
(2) The commercial portions of the village mixed use development shall be
contained within a “storefront use area.” This area shall be designed to provide
a variety of retail shops and services to support the day-to-day needs of village
residents and other local residents, complemented by other compatible
business, civic and residential uses in commercial-type buildings in a manner
consistent with a small downtown of or central market place in the community.
(3) Storefront use areas shall be located so they are easily accessible by pedestrians
from as much of the residential areas as possible (preferably within 1,500 feet –
a five-minute walk). Nonresidential uses that are intended or expected to serve
an area beyond the development itself shall be located to the extent practicable
to permit vehicular access from outside the development without passing
through residential streets.
17
(4) Storefront use areas shall be located at least 200 feet from an arterial street and
at least one-half mile from the nearest edge of another commercial center.
(5) Parking areas that serve commercial facilities shall be screened with a Type A
screen from the view of public streets located outside the development.
(6) If and to the extent that dwelling units are constructed above commercial uses
in commercial areas, the additional vehicle accommodation area required to
accommodate such residential uses shall not be treated as commercial area for
purposes of the “cap” on commercial areas established by this section.
(7) Commercial areas shall surround or be located adjacent to or across the street
from a public park, green, or square, which area may be credited as part of the
open space required of the development.
(8) Within the commercial areas authorized under this section, buildings shall be
designed and constructed so that each individual enterprise occupies (whether
as tenant or owner occupant) an area of not more than 6,000 square feet per
floor.
(b) Portions of the tract not developed in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a)
above may be developed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter applicable to property that
is zoned R-10, except as those provisions are modified by the provisions of this section or the Master
Plan or conditions imposed by the Board of Aldermen in the issuance of the conditional use permit.
(1) The number of dwelling units permissible within the entire tract shall be
determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 15-182.3 (as adjusted
by density bonuses awarded for providing affordable housing under Section
15-182.4), subject to the following:
a. Areas used for commercial purposes shall not be subtracted from the
adjusted tract acreage before determining permissible density.
b. All dwelling units constructed above commercial uses in commercial areas
(e.g. a second story apartment located above a first floor retail store or
office) shall be permissible in addition to the number of dwelling units
otherwise authorized under this section.
c. When a lot is developed as a primary residence with an accessory detached
dwelling, the accessory dwelling shall be permissible in addition to the
number of dwelling units otherwise authorized under this section.
(2) The residential portions of the development shall contain a mixture of housing
types that are generally reflective of the housing types in Carrboro and
ownership/rental options so that the development provides housing
opportunities for persons within as broad a range of income levels as is
feasible. Different housing types and price ranges shall be intermixed rather
than segregated.
a. The development shall contain an area known as a “townhouse use area.”
This area shall be designed to provide for a variety of housing
18
opportunities, including residential buildings such as townhouses and/or
apartments in close proximity to the storefront area, and to provide for the
flexible use of such buildings to accommodate compatible business and
civic uses which supplement the storefront area. The townhouse use area
shall be a designated geographic unit generally located along neighborhood
streets and adjacent to the storefront area. In approving a conditional use
permit for a Village Mixed Use Development, the Board may approve the
following uses not generally authorized in an area zoned R-10, subject to
such restrictions and conditions relating to locations, use classifications,
and other matters as the Board may provide:
1. Personal or business services
2. Office
3. Private club
4. Restaurant
5. Artist studio
6. A maximum of 4 guestrooms for lodging
7. Medical clinic or facility
8. Retail sales, if in conjunction and on the same lot as a home
occupation
b. The development shall also contain a “single-family detached residential
use area” designed to provide for single-family detached homes in a
residential neighborhood environment. In approving a conditional use
permit for a Village Mixed Use Development, the Board may approve the
following uses not generally authorized in a single family detached
residential area zoned R-10, subject to such restrictions and conditions
relating to locations, use classifications, and other matters as the Board may
provide:
1. Office, as an accessory use, or for not more than 2 full-time
employee equivalents.
(c) In addition to other applicable use regulations as provided above, lots within the
following areas may not be used for the purposes indicated below:
(1) Storefront use areas:
a. drive-in or through windows
b. uses requiring loading or unloading during non-daylight hours.
(d) In approving a conditional use permit for a village mixed use development, the Board
of Aldermen shall ensure, by approval of a condition, phasing schedule, or otherwise, that the
nonresidential portions of the development are occupied only in accordance with a schedule that
relates occupancy of such nonresidential portions of the development to the completion of a specified
percentage or specified number of phases or sections of the residential portions of the development.
The purpose and intent of this provision is to ensure that the approval process for a village mixed use
development is not used, intentionally or unintentionally, to create nonresidential uses in areas
generally zoned for residential uses except as part of an integrated and well-planned primarily
residential development.
19
(e) The open space provided within a village mixed use development pursuant to Section
15-198 shall include areas known as “village conservancy use areas “ and “greens, parks, and
squares.”
(1) Conservancy use areas are areas designed to create a visual and physical
distinction between the development, the surrounding countryside, and any
neighboring developments.
(2) Greens, parks and squares are spatially defined and distributed open spaces
within the village mixed use development designed to serve a variety of
outdoor leisure and assembly needs of village residents and to enhance the
form and appearance of the development.
(3) There shall be a main village green, which shall be centrally located in close
proximity to the storefront area as described in subsection (a)(2). Other,
smaller greens shall be dispersed throughout the remainder of the village center
in such a way that no lot is more than a walking distance of 1,320 feet from a
green, square or park. The main village green shall be designed to a pedestrian
scale and shall be no less than 30,000 square feet in size, while the other,
smaller greens, squares and parks shall be no less than 10,000 square feet in
size.
(4) Open space areas set aside in accordance with this section may be used to
satisfy the forty percent requirement of subsection 15-198(c). If the areas the
developer is required to set aside as open space under Section 15-198 together
with the areas required to be set aside under this subsection exceed forty
percent of the mixed use development, then the Board of Aldermen shall allow
the developer to set aside less than the one or more of the categories of open
space otherwise required under Section 15-198 or this subsection so that the
developer is not required to preserve as open space more than forty percent of
the development tract.
(f) Village Mixed Use Developments shall meet the following objectives with regard to
land use arrangement and design criteria:
(1) Overall Form.
a. Open space should be designed to follow the natural features whenever
possible and to provide for an agricultural, forest and undeveloped
character of the land.
b. The core of the village shall be distinguished from the peripheral,
contiguous open space by a well-defined “hard edge” of dwellings in
contrast with the open, largely agricultural, forest and undeveloped
character of the open space.
c. The village should be sited so as to best preserve natural vistas and the
existing topography.
20
d. The village should be designed in a generally rectilinear pattern of
blocks and interconnecting streets and alleys, defined by buildings,
street furniture, landscaping, pedestrian ways and sidewalks.
(2) Spatial Relationships of Various Use Areas and Open Space.
a. The common, peripheral open space shall surround the village unless
explicitly modified upon a finding that unique topographical or other
natural features or preexisting boundary conditions require an
alternative arrangement.
b. Village storefront use and townhouse use areas shall be surrounded by
the residential use area or, where applicable, by a combination of
residential and civic use areas.
c. Higher density residential lots should be generally located between the
designated commercial area and lower density residential lots.
d. The transition between uses shall be blended to avoid a distinct visual
segregation.
(3) Block Design
a. Blocks of a generally rectangular shape should be the main organizing
feature of the village. While topography, existing vegetation,
hydrology and design intentions should influence block shape and size,
the maximum length for a block is to be four hundred and eighty (480)
feet with an allowance for blocks up to six hundred (600) feet when
mid-block pedestrian paths or ways are provided. No less than one
eight-foot pedestrian alley or way must be provided for every twohundred
(200) feet of road frontage in the storefront use area.
b. The blocks of the village may be subdivided into lots, having frontage
on a street, whose generally rectangular shape should respond to
environmental factors, the proposed use and design intentions.
c. Village lots should minimize front and side yards, garage aprons and
entrances and blank walls, and should generally have as narrow a width
as is practical to encourage pedestrian movement.
d. Each block which includes storefront and narrow frontage townhouse
lots shall be designed to include an alley or small clusters of parking,
with service access in the rear. Blocks of wide frontage townhouse lots
need not be designed to include an alley and rear parking.
e. Similar land use types shall generally front one another while dissimilar
land use types shall generally abut along alleys or rear parking.
f. Lot layout, path and sidewalk design shall ensure pedestrian access to
each lot.
21
g. The build-up line specifies a cornice height that establishes the
prominent visual dimension of a building and defines its proportion in
relation to the street. It should vary, with no more than sixty (60)
consecutive feet of the build-up line having a similar cornice or
roofline, and be between one and three and one-half stories in height.
A two-story build-up line can range from 20 to 25 feet above average
ground level. A three-story build-up line can range from 30 to 35 feet
above average ground level. (AMENDED 5/28/02)
(4) Storefront and Townhouse use Area Design Components
a. New multi-family and commercial buildings in storefront and
townhouse use areas shall be subject to a maximum front setback (the
“build-to” line) in order to maintain a strong sense of streetscape. Such
buildings shall generally be of two-story construction (to the so-called
“build-up” line) and shall be designed in accordance with the design
standards of this chapter and any other applicable standards. To create
a defined edge to the village’s public space, new multi-family or
commercial buildings should conform to a consistent setback from the
street. Porches for multi-family or townhouse construction can extend
beyond the build-to line. In addition, building faces, as well as a
majority of the roof ridgelines should be parallel to the street.
b. Maximum height regulations are 49 feet and three and a half stories.
c. Minimum street frontage is 25 feet.
d. Setback regulations are as follows: Front = no minimum required;
maximum is 15 feet; Rear = 20 feet minimum; Side = Zero minimum
lot lines are allowed, except at block ends or adjacent to alleys or
pedestrian walks as required under block design requirements.
e. Parking within this area shall be subject to the other parking
requirements of this chapter as well as the following:
1. Non-residential off-street parking shall generally be to the side or
the rear, or located within internal parking areas not visible from
the street.
2. The permit-issuing authority may allow on-street parking
spaces along the front property line (except where there are
driveway cuts) to be counted toward the minimum number of
parking spaces required for the use on that lot.
3. On-street parking space shall be designed as either parallel to
the curb on both sides of the street, or diagonal to the street on
the storefront side with landscaped breaks serving the
pedestrian alleyways.
4. Off–street parking may be located within 100 feet (measured along
a publicly accessible route) from the lot containing the use to which
22
the parking is accessory, if the lot containing the parking is owned
or leased to the owner of the principal use, or if the lot containing
the parking is dedicated to parking for as long as the use to which it
is accessory shall continue, and it is owned by an entity capable of
assuring its maintenance as accessory parking.
5. The permit-issuing authority may allow shared use of parking.
f. All public sidewalks and walkways shall:
1. Be constructed of brick or concrete with brick borders in such a
way that they do not impede accessibility.
2. Be no less than six feet in width; and
3. Create a completely interconnected network of pedestrian
walkways throughout the storefront use and townhouse use
areas.
g. All storefront and townhouse use areas shall contain the following:
1. At least one trash can and one recycling receptacle of approved
design in each block;
2. Public benches of approved design at bus stops, green spaces,
and at intervals of no greater than 200 feet along both sides of
each block and at lesser intervals and/or in required clusters, as
appropriate (i.e. high-activity areas due to the nature of
surrounding uses).; and
3. At least one bike rack on each block.
h. All new construction shall be of similar scale and massing to smallscale,
historic buildings in downtown Carrboro.
i. All roofs shall be topped with low-pitched roofs with articulated
parapets and cornices, or pitched roofs where fascias are emphasized
and any roof dormers are functional.
j. Storefront buildings shall:
1. Include show windows on the ground level. Storefront
windows are to be large and traditional in appearance and are to
include low sills and high lintels.
2. Articulate the line between the ground and upper levels with a
cornice, canopy, balcony, arcade, or other visual device.
3. Include lighting in show windows, which is in conformance
with other lighting regulations, herein;
23
4. Project lighting on the sidewalk from about eight feet in
conformance with other lighting regulations herein;
5. Present the principal entrance to the sidewalk. Alternatively, if
the principle entrance faces onto an interior courtyard, the
entrance to the courtyard must be presented to the sidewalk.
k. The facade of storefront buildings may be separated from the sidewalk
surface by a landscaped strip of no greater than three feet, except as
necessary to accommodate open-air, food service establishments.
l. The construction of open colonnades over a sidewalk adjoining
storefront buildings may be permitted subject to an appropriate
easement over the public right-of-way.
m. Materials in the exterior of buildings surrounding the greens shall be
limited to a diversity of brick. Wood, stucco, masonry and other siding

viewing of storefronts and signage.
2. The planting of trees every 30 feet to 50 feet depending on size
so as to create a regular pattern of street trees through the area.
(5) Residential uses within the single family detached residential use area shall
conform to the following requirements:
24
a. Lots shall generally be located along local streets and around the
perimeter of the combined storefront and townhouse areas and between
those areas and the village conservancy district.
b. The minimum lot width at the building line shall be 40 feet unless the
Board of Aldermen has also approved the development as an
architecturally integrated subdivision a described in Section 15-187.
c. Variations in the principal building position and orientation shall be
encouraged, but the following minimum standards shall be observed:
Front yard: 15 feet minimum (but 8 feet to front porches or steps) and
25 feet maximum; Rear yard: 30 feet minimum for principal buildings
and 5 feet for accessory buildings; Side yard: 20-foot separation for
principal buildings, with no side yard less than 5 feet unless the Board
of Aldermen has also approved the development as an architecturally
integrated subdivision a described in Section 15-187.
d. The total impervious coverage shall be 50 percent for all of the lots
in this use area except for those approved to include 22.000 uses.
Allocation to each lot shall be indicated on the conditional use
permit plans and must be finalized at the time a final plat is recorded.
For multi-phase projects, the final allocation shall be by phase. No
further reallocation of impervious surface coverage for lots in this
use area shall be allowed after the final plat has been recorded,
unless a conditional use permit is modified to allow 22.000 uses.
Any such 22.000 uses shall be subject to stormwater management

designed to harmonize with the Carrboro vernacular
architecture described above.
2. There shall be a maximum of one accessory dwelling unit
(ADD) per lot of less than ten (10) acres.
3. The gross floor area in the ADD shall not exceed 750 square
feet.
25
4. Exterior fire-exit stairs are prohibited on any side of Accessory
Detached Dwellings except at their rear, except in cases when
the ADD is located above a garage.
5. All off-street parking for Accessory Detached Dwellings shall
be located to the side or rear as viewed from the street.
(6) Roads and Streets.
a. Street patterns within the village mixed use shall be a rectilinear
network of streets, interconnected with clear, direct, understandable
patterns, with variations as needed for topographic and environment

location and size of both existing vegetation to be retained and
proposed new vegetation, typical planting materials, the phasing of
landscape installation and planting methods.
b. Shade trees shall be provided along each side of all streets, public or
private, existing or proposed. Shade trees shall also be massed at
critical points, such as at focal points along a curve in the roadway. In
locations where healthy and mature shade trees currently exist, the
requirements or new trees may be waived or modified. Section 15-315
of this Chapter notwithstanding, the developer shall either plant or
retain sufficient trees so that, between the paved portion of the street
and a line running parallel to and twenty- five feet from the center line

(a) Mobile prepared food vendors shall be located on lots where an existing nonresidential
use operates in a permanent building.
(b) As set forth in the Table of Permissible Uses, mobile prepared food vendors are
permissible in the B-1(C), B-1(G) and M-1 districts (subject to the other provisions of this section).
In addition, mobile prepared food vendors shall also be permissible on lots in the R-10 district
where (and so long as) there exists a nonconforming retail business located in a permanent building.
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 15-154 (Combination Uses), a zoning
permit may be issued for a mobile prepared food vendor, and in issuing the permit, the zoning
administrator shall take into consideration only this use and not the other use or uses made of the lot
where the mobile prepared food vendor is located [except that this use must comply with subsection
(a)].
(d) Mobile prepared food vendors shall be subject to the building setback requirements
of Section 15-184 but shall not be subject to the other provisions of Article XII or to the provisions

accommodation area where such location would prevent the use of required parking spaces during
the regular hours of operation of the primary business on the lot, or otherwise interfere in a
significant way with the movement of motor vehicles using such area.
(g) Mobile prepared food vendors shall not operate as a drive-through.
(h) A zoning permit issued for this use may be revoked not only for the reasons
specified in Section 15-115 but also if the zoning administrator determines that the mobile prepared
food vendor’s operations are causing parking, traffic congestion, or litter problems either on or off
the property where the use is located or that such use is otherwise creating a danger to the public
health or safety.

Section 15-177 Architectural Standards for Subdivisions Containing Four or More Single-
Family Detached Residences (AMENDED 5/25/99; REWRITTEN 8/22/06)
(a) Intent. The intent of the provisions of this section is to ensure that developers of
major subdivisions who are responsible for the construction of homes within those subdivisions
pay as much attention to the site design and architectural features of their developments as they
do to engineering considerations, so that the town’s newest neighborhoods will reflect a high
standard of design and enhance Carrboro’s unique appeal. These provisions of this section are
not intended to dampen architectural creativity or diversity but rather to ensure that important
architectural and design considerations are addressed.
(b) Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to subdivisions containing
four or more single family detached residences, where the developer of the subdivision is not
merely selling lots within the subdivision to independent builders or individuals, but is also the
builder of the homes or otherwise controls the construction of homes and is therefore in a
position to comply with the requirements of this section at the time the subdivision is approved.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, housing developed by nonprofit organizations intended for firsttime
homebuyers earning less than 80% of the annual median income level for a family of four in
the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area is exempt from the provisions of
this section.
(c) Definitions. The following terms shall have the meaning indicated when used in this
section:
(1) Contemporary Architecture: describes a building that is derived from current
ideas of architectural form, construction and detailing.
(2) Context: the surrounding buildings and land forms, the social and the built history
of the location.
Art. XI SUPPLEMENTARY USE REGULATIONS
33
(3) Massing: the relationship of solids to voids, and the relationship of major
components of the building such as roof, wall planes, and porches to one another,
to surrounding buildings, and to the landscape in general.
(4) Proportion: the relationship between the vertical and horizontal elements of the
building.
(5) Scale: the relationship of the size of the building, its components, and its
architectural details to people as users and observers.
(6) Vernacular: a building style that is historical and typical of a region and surrounding
area. The predominant residential vernacular style in Carrboro and the surrounding
area is the mill-era housing.
(d) General Design Standards. The developer of every major subdivision covered by this section
shall, in the process of designing the proposed subdivision, address each of the design
considerations set forth in this section. The developer’s plans submitted with the application for a
special or conditional use permit shall reflect that each of the following design considerations have
been addressed, and the application shall contain a written narrative explaining how each of these
design considerations have been addressed. The design considerations are divided into three
categories: landscape and site, context, and building.
(1) Landscape and site.
a. Site buildings in a manner sensitive to the existing natural environment and
land forms. Minimize clearing and alteration of existing topography.
b. Site buildings or provide screening to avoid the visibility of buildings’ rear
facades from public streets.
c. Avoid monolithic and unarticulated walls and buildings facing the public
realm.
d. Mechanical, communication, and electrical equipment shall be screened from
neighbors and public ways through the use of landscaping or by fences/screens
made of materials that complement the design of the house.
e. Garage entries should not visually dominate the house’s primary entrance, and
shall have visual separation from the main façade.
f. Locate and specify exterior and street lighting to minimize the impact on
neighbors. Fixtures shall not project light above the horizontal plane.
Art. XI SUPPLEMENTARY USE REGULATIONS
34
g. Address the transition between street and primary entrance through pathways
that consider changes of light, sound, direction, surface, or grade level, i.e.
through the use of benches, fencing, or low walls connected to the building.
h. Use variable setbacks and modulate the streetscape.
(2) Context.
a. Address the overall plan of the subdivision in terms of rhythm, building
heights, patterns, spacing, form, scale, massing, materials, and proportion.
b. Address the placement of buildings in relationship to one another; their height,
orientation, and spacing.
c. Address the vertical-to-horizontal proportions of the elements of each
individual house, and the relationship of these proportions from one house to
another.
d. Address the relationship of the roof of one building to the next in rhythm,
form, texture, detail, and shelter, with attention to color, materials, and pitch
and to features such as soffits, rafter ends, vaults, overhangs, dormers,
cornices, vents, fascias, gutters, and eaves.
e. Provide human scale in massing and building elements.
(3) Building design elements.
a. Provide a minimum of four significantly different sets of elevations if the
subdivision contains five or six houses, five sets if seven or eight houses, six
sets if nine or ten houses and seven sets if eleven or twelve houses, and eight
sets if thirteen or fourteen houses, to ensure variability of design. Subdivisions
of fifteen or more houses must have a minimum of nine differing elevations.
b. Create recognizable primary entrances, using, for example, entry placement,
front and side porches, trellises, hedges, fences, and walls.
c. Address the architectural rhythm of solids to voids in front façades, exterior
walls, buildings on the streets, and entrance and/or porch projection.
d. Address façade relief as provided by corner trim, porch trim, window and door
trim, door panels, transoms, frames, surrounds, shutters, muntins, moldings,
corbelling, cornices, gables, columns, casings, vents, fabric awnings, and
roofs. Specify materials and dimensions.
Art. XI SUPPLEMENTARY USE REGULATIONS
35
e. Specify the design of doors and windows, and their spacing, placement,
proportion, scale, orientation, and size.
f. Address the design and character of all exterior walls and foundations,
including their functional and decorative features, materials, details, and
proportions in relation to the entire building.
g. The design of auxiliary buildings, fences, and privacy screens, and the
materials used in their construction, should complement the design of the
primary structure.
(e) Building Architectural Styles. As set forth in (d)(3) above, the developer shall submit
elevations that address the general design standards set forth therein.
(1) Vernacular Architectural Standards. Developers are encouraged to consider
complying with the provisions of Section 15-177 (d)(3) by using Vernacular
Architectural Standards (VAS) as described in this subsection. The goal of
the VAS approach is to maintain and enhance Carrboro’s historic mill-era
architecture, which distinguishes it and is a primary element in defining
Carrboro’s unique sense of place. New subdivisions using the VAS approach
should recognize and reflect the local architectural vernacular. This approach
notes the defining elements of the vernacular and requires that those elements
be used in conjunction with appropriate scale, proportion, massing, and
texture. Proposed plans need not be copies of historic Carrboro houses;
successful contextual design combines current design ideas with sensitivity
and reference to the defining architecture of the locale.
a. Following is a list of the minimum criteria necessary to meet the
Vernacular Architectural Standards and its goal of maintaining an architectural
connection to Carrboro’s past.
? Roof characteristics: 10-12 /12 upper roofs, 3/12 lower roofs, 16-24” eaves
at all roof edges.
? Porches with a minimum depth of 6’, across at least 80% of the primary
street façade.
? Windows must be rectangular; at least 90% must have a minimum
vertical-to-horizontal proportion of two-to-one.
? Clapboard or shingle siding with 4½” reveal.
? Paired 4” corner boards.
Art. XI SUPPLEMENTARY USE REGULATIONS
36
? Garage, if any, to be detached and located behind the house’s rear façade
? Chimney, if any, to be faced with brick or stone, interior to the building or
located exterior, on a gable end
? Details such as columns, trim, vents, dormers, and eaves reflective of the
character of the vernacular (see building types, below)
b. Four building types display most of the primary architectural elements
characteristic of residences built in Carrboro’s mill era. All photos are from
Carrboro’s Historic Inventory.
One-story Mill House
Art. XI SUPPLEMENTARY USE REGULATIONS
37
The one-story mill house is modest in scale, with simple massing defined by a
one-room deep “L”-shaped plan, gable roof, generous front porch, and
moderate roof overhangs. It is characterized by symmetry in the gable ends
and front and has windows of a vertical proportion placed singly in the wall
plane. The exterior details generally consist of a false dormer, clapboard
siding, 4” trim and corner boards, diamond gable vents, plain square porch
posts with simple brackets, and simple pickets in porch rails. Garages were
single-car gable-roofed buildings set behind the house.
Two-story “I” House
The two-story “I” house is defined by its moderate massing, a one-room deep
plan, two-story front and one-story “L”, gable roof, generous front porch, and
moderate roof overhangs. It is symmetrical in its front elevation and gable
ends and has windows of a vertical proportion placed singly in the wall plane.
The exterior details generally consist of a false dormer, clapboard siding, 4”
trim and corner boards, diamond gable vents, plain square porch posts with
simple brackets, and simple pickets in the porch rail. Garages were single-car,
gable-roofed, and set behind the house.
The Bungalow
Art. XI SUPPLEMENTARY USE REGULATIONS
38
The bungalow style house is a medium scale building with a solid massing
defined by its square floor plan, gable roof, generous front porch, moderate
roof overhangs, and large dormers. It is characterized by large articulated
gable ends, windows of a vertical proportion spaced doubly or triply in the
wall plane, and a porch roof contiguous with the main roof. The exterior
details generally consist of clapboard siding or shakes, 4” trim and corner
boards, generous two-part square porch posts, and large gable end brackets,
rake, and eave boards.
The Four-Square House
This is another medium-scale building type with a solid straight-forward
massing defined by its square two-room deep plan, hip roof, moderate roof
overhangs, dormers, and generous front porch. The defining characteristics
are a symmetrical front elevation, windows of a vertical proportion placed
singly in the wall plane, and a porch roof that is distinct from the main roof.
The exterior details generally consist of clapboard siding, 4’ trim and corner
boards, modest brackets, and simple square porch pickets.
(2) Alternative Architectural Standards. Developers may also comply with the
provisions of this section by using Alternative Architectural Standards (AAS). The
AAS approach recognizes that architecture is constantly evolving and that changing
needs, tastes, and technologies generate new styles. Carrboro welcomes new and
varied architecture but does not want to open the door to developments that neglect
thoughtful design. Applicants may therefore choose to submit plans in accordance
with this section using Alternative Architectural Standards. As with the Vernacular
Architectural Standards, plans must be in compliance with the General Design
Standards.
(f) Glossary of Architectural Terms. The following glossary of terms is made available
for use by architects and developers in their interpretation of the provisions of this section.

Section 15-178 Architectural Standards for Downtown Development. (AMENDED
6/20/06)
(a) The Board has established a policy that encourages the evolution of a downtown district
that embodies the Town’s character and includes medium-rise buildings that are
appropriately sited with adequate public access in keeping with downtown design
guidelines. High-quality building design and construction are considered primary elements
of the built environment in downtown Carrboro. Creativity is encouraged to the extent that
new architectural design is harmonious and complementary with existing buildings and with
the community as a whole. Standards have been developed to add consistency and
predictability to the permit review process. The following provisions shall apply to new
construction within the B-1(c), B-1(g), CT, M-1, and B-2 zoning districts. All projects must
conform with the following requirements to the extent practicable, except as otherwise
provided in subsection (b):
(1) A primary entrance shall be oriented toward the right of way and shall be
articulated either by a recess or by a detachable awning.
(2) With respect to any side of a building that faces the street adjacent to the lot
where the building is located and is visible from such street right-of-way, a minimum of 40
percent of the elevation of such side shall consist of a glass surface, and a minimum of 60
percent of the elevation of the ground level of such façade shall consist of a glass surface.
(3) Buildings taller than 40 feet shall maintain a 20-percent shade free area within
the public right of way between two lines extended north from the easternmost and
westernmost points of the building at the street right of way as measured at noon on
September 21.
(4) Parking or utility areas shall be substantially shielded from the view of
Art. XI SUPPLEMENTARY USE REGULATIONS
45
adjoining streets by habitable space. For the purposes of this subsection, the term habitable
shall mean partially or fully enclosed space within a building that is actively used or
occupied by the residents of the building. The active use of these spaces is characterized by
the routine and regular presence of the building’s residents rather than the routine and
regular presence of stored goods, equipment, or other materials.
(5) A building more than 45 feet in width shall be divided into increments of no
more than 45 feet through articulation of the façade achieved through the following
techniques:
(a) Divisions or breaks in materials
(b)Window bays
(c) Separate entrances and entry treatments
(d) Variation in roof line
(e) Building setbacks
(6) The following exterior materials are prohibited: metal siding with exposed
fasteners, vinyl siding, and processed wood panel products (e.g. hardboard).
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, applicants for projects that do not comply with the
standards specified above may voluntarily participate in an alternative design review
process that involves input from or a decision by the Appearance Commission as follows:
(AMENDED 2/23/10).
(1) If the project requires the issuance of a zoning permit and the Appearance
Commission certifies to the zoning administrator that the alternative design
substantially achieves the purpose (as spelled out in subsection (a) of this
section) of the architectural standards for downtown development, then the
development shall not be required to comply with the standards set forth in
subsection (a).
(2) If the project requires a special use or conditional use permit, then the
Appearance Commission shall review the alternative design and make a
recommendation to the permit-issuing authority as to whether that design
substantially achieves the purpose (as spelled out in subsection (a) of this
section) of the architectural standards for downtown development. If the
permit issuing authority concludes that the alternative design substantially
achieves the purpose of these architectural standards, then the development
shall not be required to comply with the standards set forth in subsection (a).
Section 15-179 Child Day Care Homes and Child Day Care Facilities (AMENDED 6/26/07)
(a) Where outdoor play areas associated with a child day care home or child day care facility
are within 25 feet of a neighboring residential structure, outdoor play shall not commence
until 8:30 a.m. Where outdoor play areas associated with a child day care home or
Art. XI SUPPLEMENTARY USE REGULATIONS
46
facility are within 300 feet of a neighboring residential structure, outdoor play shall not
commence until noon on Sundays.
(b) For all day care homes and facilities, adequate vehicular turnaround area must be
provided on-site or within nearby public-right-of-way, so that use of nearby private
property may be avoided. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, for day care
facilities located on collector or arterial streets, the day care operator must demonstrate, at
time of permit application, that sufficient parking spaces are provided on site, and that
appropriate driveway access and configuration are provided such that site ingress and
egress present no additional hazards in the street right-of-way, such as cars queuing up in
the street, or cars backing into the street.
(c) A neighborhood meeting is required, inviting neighbors and property owners living or
owning property within 500 feet of the boundaries of the subject property, with the
purpose of the day care owner explaining the daycare proposal and receiving suggestions
from neighbors as to ways to limit negative impact on the neighborhood.
(d) Yards associated with child day care homes and facilities shall be maintained free of
refuse and garbage.
15-179.1 Day Care Uses Within Village Mixed Use Developments (AMENDED 6/26/12)
All 22.000 (Day Care) uses that are located within the single family residential use areas
of a village mixed use development shall install and maintain site development and/or building
features to ensure that the environmental impact, including but not limited to storm water
volume, nutrient loading, water use or greenhouse gas emissions, contributed by the development
activity is managed and/or reduced through a combination of features and practices that will
result in an overall reduction in environmental impact from that which otherwise could
reasonably be expected to occur in association with development of the 22.000 use. Specific
performance measures that will be evaluated to determine whether the intent of this subsection
has been met are as follows:
(1) Open space, if practicable, is dedicated to either the homeowners association or
the town, and
(2) Storm water best management practices (BMPs) and associated grading and
stabilization occur outside any primary conservation areas, and all runoff from
the BMPs is discharged in a diffuse manner that insures that erosional rills will
not be created as runoff enters and flows through conservation areas; and
(3) Roof drainage is captured in sufficient quantity and in appropriately sized and
sited devices to provide at a minimum for all on-site plantings, including but not
be limited to screenings, vehicle accommodation areas, foundation plantings,
garden beds, trees, shrubs, flowers, groundcover, and turf, and
Art. XI SUPPLEMENTARY USE REGULATIONS
47
(4) Nutrient load requirements may be met (i) by storm water management structures
or devices on the development site itself and/or (ii) the retrofitting of existing or
construction of new BMPs elsewhere in the VMU development, and
(5) Educational materials including, but not limited to on-site signage, brochures, and
web postings on stormwater management practices are prepared and/or installed,
and Low Impact Development techniques are used to the extent practicable.

Section 15-182.1 Residential Density in R-SIR Zoning.
(a) Land that is zoned R-SIR may be developed in the same manner and at the same
density as land within an R-10 zoning district. However, the provisions of this
section are designed to encourage development that furthers the town’s housing
goals by offering density bonuses for such development.
(b) A major housing goal of the town is to obtain in the community a sufficient
number of housing units by type, style and price to afford residents a suitable
dwelling of their choice. To the degree that a development meets one or more of
the performance criteria set forth below, it helps to further this housing goal and
therefore should be entitled to a density bonus determined in accordance with
subsection (c).
(1) The development consists of at least thirty but less than eighty percent
ownership units. Each undeveloped lot in a residential subdivision as well
as each single-family residence shall be considered an ownership unit.
Condominiums shall also be considered ownership units.
(2) The development offers at least three different number-of-bedroom options,
with each type comprising at least ten percent of the total number of
dwelling units. Lots intended for sale in their undeveloped state shall not be
considered for purposes of this performance criterion.
(3) The development offers a variety of the following six residential building
styles: (i) single-family on lots 7,500 square feet or greater, (ii) singlefamily
on lots smaller than 7,500 square feet, (iii) one-story multi-family or
duplex, (iv) two or three-story multi-family or duplex, each unit having a
Art. XII DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
Page #5
separate ground level entrance, (v) two or three-story multi-family or duplex,
each unit not having a separate ground level entrance, and (vi) multi-family
high rise (i.e., four or more stories). This performance criteria may be
satisfied at the following three levels:
a. Two building styles (thirty percent minimum, each style).
b. Three building styles (twenty five percent minimum, each style).
c. Four or more building styles (fifteen percent minimum for each of at
least four styles).
(c) Residential development in the R-SIR zoning district that meet one or more of the
performance criteria described in subsection (b) may be developed according to the
density set forth below. Notwithstanding subsection 15-154(b), the total density of
the development shall be determined by dividing the total area of the lot to be
developed by the appropriate figure of square feet per dwelling unit, and rounding
off to the nearest whole number.

10,000 square foot minimum lot size may be reduced pursuant to Sections 15-186
(cluster subdivisions) and 15-187 (Architecturally Integrated Subdivisions).
(e) Land that is zoned R-S.I.R.-2 may be developed in the same manner as that which is
zoned R-S.I.R. except that the minimum square feet per dwelling unit shall in no
case be less than 6,000 square feet. (AMENDED 5/12/81)
Section 15-182.2 Effect of Public Acquisition of Property On Density, Setback and Height
Requirements, (AMENDED 4/2/02;5/28/02;4/8/03)
(a) Subject to other provisions of this section, if (i) any portion of a lot lies within an
area designated on any officially adopted town plan as part of a proposed public
park, greenway, or bikeway, or the town or the N.C. Department of Transportation
otherwise seeks to acquire a portion of a lot for any public use, and (ii) before the lot
is developed, the owner of the lot, with the concurrence of the town, dedicates to the
town or the N.C. Department of Transportation that portion of the lot so designated
or sought to be acquired, or the town or the N.C. Department of Transportation
Art. XII DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
Page #6
condemns the same, then, when the remainder of the lot is developed for residential
purposes, the permissible density at which the remainder may be developed shall be
calculated by regarding the dedicated portion of the original lot as if it were still part
of the lot proposed for development. (AMENDED 11/26/85; 11/28/89)
(b) If the portion of the lot that remains after dedication as provided in subsection (a)
is divided in such a way that the division either does not constitute a subdivision
or constitutes only a minor subdivision (as these terms are defined in Section
15-15), then, when each of the lots so created is later developed for residential
purposes, the permissible density at which each lot may be developed shall be
calculated in the following manner:
(1) Divide the area of the particular lot in question by the total area of the
portion of the original lot not dedicated to the town.
(2) Multiply the fraction derived from step (1) above times the total area of the
dedicated portion of the original lot.
(3) Regard the area derived from the calculation in step (2) above as if it were
part of the lot in question and calculate the density on the basis of this
combined area.
(c) In no case may the density permitted under this section exceed a level of fifteen
dwelling units per acre.
(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, the town may condemn
additional right-of-way along an existing street even though such condemnation
creates a nonconforming lot, and the property owner may at the request of the town
dedicate additional right-of-way along an existing street even though such
dedication creates or results in the creation of nonconforming lots. (AMENDED
11/26/85)
(e) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, a property owner may dedicate
to the town or the town may otherwise acquire a right-of-way over or a fee simple
interest in a portion of a lot, even though such acquisition creates a situation where a
building or sign is so located on the remainder of the lot that it is inconsistent with
the setback requirements set forth in Section 15-184. The setback situation so
created shall be regarded as in conformity with the setback requirements of this
chapter (rather than as a nonconforming situation) except in relation to the
provisions of Section 15-92.1(e). (AMENDED 4/2/02)
(f) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, if a property owner dedicates
of the town or the State otherwise acquires from a property owner additional rightof-
way along an existing street, then to the extent that the height of a building is
dependent on the distance a building is set back from a street right-of-way, the
Art. XII DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
Page #7
maximum building height permitted under Section 15-185 shall be calculated as if
such dedication or acquisition had not been made, provided that this provision shall
not be applicable if right-of-way is dedicated pursuant to subsection 15-185(a)(3)(a).

Section 15-182.3 Residential Density of Major Developments in Certain Districts
AMENDED 05/25/99
(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 15-182, when any tract of land within
the R-10, R-15, R-20, and RR districts is developed under circumstances
requiring the issuance of a special or conditional use permit, the maximum
number of dwelling units that may placed on that tract shall be determined in
accordance with the provisions of this section.
(b) If the development is to be served by OWASA owned water and sewer lines, then
the maximum number of dwelling units for any type of residential development
shall be determined by dividing the adjusted tract acreage [calculated in accordance
with the provisions of subsection (c) below] by the “minimum square feet per
dwelling unit” associated with the zoning district of the property to be developed as
set forth in Section 15-182. (AMENDED 06/22/99)
(c) The adjusted tract acreage shall be calculated by deducting from the gross acreage
of the tract the sum total of each of the following areas that may be located within
the tract in question. If an area within the tract qualifies under more than one of
the following categories, then that area shall be included only within the one
category that involves the most restrictive (i.e. the greatest) deduction.
(1) Floodways: multiply the area within a floodway by a factor of 1.0.
(2) Wetlands: multiply the area of designated wetlands by a factor of 0.95.
(3) Major Rock Formations: multiply the area of major rock formations by a
factor of 0.90.
(4) Steep Slopes: multiply the area of land with natural ground slopes exceeding
25 percent by a factor of 0.80.
(5) Land traversed by high-tension electrical transmission lines (69kv or
higher): multiply the area within the power easement by a factor of 0.75.
(6) Floodplains: multiply the 100-year floodplain by a factor of 0.5.
(7) Moderately steep slopes: multiply the area with natural ground slopes of
between 15 and 25 percent by a factor of 0.4.
Art. XII DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
Page #8
(8) Land traversed by underground utility lines (not within a street right of way):
multiply the area within the easement (or if no easement exists, the area
within ten feet on either side of the line) by a factor of 0.3.
(d) If the development is not to be served by OWASA owned water and sewer lines,
then the maximum number of dwelling units shall be determined in reference to
an actual yield plan prepared by the developer in accordance with the provisions
of this subsection. The yield plan shall be a conceptual layout of a single-family
residential subdivision (containing proposed lots that meet the minimum lot size
requirements of the district where the property is located, streets, easements, and
other pertinent features) that could be developed within the tract in question in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Although the yield plan must be
drawn to scale, it need not reflect any great degree of site engineering. However,
it must be a realistic layout reflecting a development pattern that could reasonably
be expected to be implemented, taking into account the topography of the land
and natural constraints, existing easements and encumbrances, and the applicable
provisions of this chapter, particularly those relating to open space, recreational
facilities, and street rights of way. In addition, the yield plan shall be prepared
under the assumption that each lot will be served with an individual septic tank
located on the same lot as the house it serves. The applicant shall submit
evidence (in the form of a preliminary soils evaluation from Orange County or
comparable information from a qualified source) that there appears to be sufficient
suitable soil within each of the proposed lots to support a septic tank system
serving at least a three-bedroom house. When a yield plan meeting the
requirements of this subsection has been submitted, the zoning administrator shall
confirm this in a letter to the developer, which letter shall indicate the maximum
number of dwelling units that can be developed on the tract in accordance with
this subsection.
Section 15-182.4 Residential Density Bonuses for Affordable Housing (AMENDED 05/25/99,
8/22/06, 1/22/08, 3/20/12, 4/22/14, 6/24/14, 1/27/15; REWRITTEN 6/26/07)
(a) The Board of Aldermen has established as a policy goal that at least fifteen percent of
the housing units within all new residential developments should consist of affordable
housing units as described in this section. The remaining provisions of this section
are designed to provide incentives to encourage developers to comply with this
policy goal either by providing affordable housing units or lots or, under the circumstances
set forth in subsection (j), by making payments in lieu of providing such affordable
housing units. (AMENDED 1/22/08, 1/27/15)
(b) For purposes of this section, an affordable housing unit means a dwelling unit that
satisfies the requirements of the following subsections (c) through (f): (AMENDED
1/27/15)
(c) The appropriately-sized affordable housing unit must be offered for sale or rent at
a price that does not exceed an amount that can be afforded by a family whose anArt.
XII DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
Page #9
nual gross income equals 80 percent of the median gross annual family income, as
most recently established by the United States Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for a family of a specific size within the Metropolitan Statistical
Area where the Town of Carrboro is located; provided that a for-sale housing unit
that is offered for sale at a price that exceeds the foregoing limit but does not exceed
an amount that can be afforded by a family whose annual gross income
equals 115% of the median gross annual family income shall also be regarded as
affordable so long as (i) such unit otherwise qualifies as an affordable housing
unit under this section, and (ii) units that qualify as affordable under this exception
do not constitute more than 25% of the affordable housing units provided
within any development (AMENDED 3/20/12, 1/27/15)
(d) It is conclusively presumed that a family can afford to spend 30% of its annual
gross income on housing costs. In the case of housing units that are for sale, the
term “housing costs” shall mean the costs of principal and interest on any mortgage,
real property taxes, insurance, fees paid to a property owners association,
and any ground lease or maintenance fees. In the case of rental housing units, the
term “housing costs” shall mean the cost of rent plus utilities. In making the calculation
called for in this subsection, it shall be conclusively presumed that a unit
is appropriately sized when an efficiency or one bedroom housing unit serves a
family of one, that a two bedroom housing unit serves a family of two; that a three
bedroom housing unit serves a family of three, and that a housing unit containing
four or more bedrooms serves a family of four. (AMENDED 1/27/15)
(e) The developer shall also establish or provide for arrangements to ensure that each
such affordable unit is made available for sale or rent only to a family whose annual
gross income does not exceed (i) 80% of the median gross annual income of
a family of the same size within the Metropolitan Statistical Area where the town
of Carrboro is located, or (ii) 115% of the median gross annual income of a family
of the same size within the Metropolitan Statistical Area where the town of
Carrboro is located if the unit is one that qualifies as affordable under the
115% exception provided for in subsection (c). (AMENDED 3/20/12, 1/27/15).
(f) The developer of the affordable housing unit must establish or provide for arrangements
to ensure that, for a period of not less than 99 years from the date of initial occupancy
of the unit, such unit shall remain affordable (as provided in subsection (c))
and shall be offered for sale or rent only to families that satisfy the income criteria set
forth in subsection (e). Such arrangements may include but shall not be limited to a
ground lease, a deed restriction, or other covenant running with the unit. The documents
establishing such arrangements shall be reviewed and approved by the Town
of Carrboro prior to final plat approval if the units are located on subdivided lots or
prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy if the units are not located
on unsubdivided lots. The provisions of this subsection shall be considered satisfied
if units are transferred to the Orange Community Housing and Land Trust at or below
Art. XII DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
Page #10
a price that is consistent with the provisions of subsection (c) above. (AMENDED
1/27/15)
(g) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, if a dwelling unit is transferred
to the Orange Community Housing and Land Trust or other non-profit housing provider
in order to qualify such unit as “affordable” under the provisions of this section,
and the financial institution that provides a loan to the buyer requires that such loan
be secured by a deed of trust or other instrument that allows the unit to be sold upon
default free and clear of the affordability restrictions set forth in this section, then the
Land Trust or other non-profit housing provider may agree to such financing terms.
Should foreclosure under such a deed of trust occur, this shall not render nonconforming
or otherwise have an adverse effect upon either the affordable unit or the development
that created the affordable unit. (AMENDED 1/27/15)
(h) For purposes of this section, an affordable housing lot shall mean a lot that (i) is designed
and approved for the construction of a single family dwelling, and (ii) upon
creation of such lot by the recording of a final plat, is donated (without additional
consideration) to a non-profit agency that is in the business of constructing on such
lots affordable housing units that meet the affordability criteria set forth in subsections
(c) through (f) above. (AMENDED 1/27/15)
(i) The maximum residential density permissible within a development whose maximum
density would otherwise be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions
of this Article XII shall be increased by two dwelling units for every one affordable
housing unit constructed within the development, up to a maximum of 150%
of the density otherwise allowable. Similarly, the maximum number of single family
detached residential building lots that could otherwise be created within a development
tract under the applicable provisions of this Article XII may be increased by
two such lots for every one affordable housing lots created within such development,
up to a maximum of 150% of the maximum density otherwise allowable. To
illustrate, if the maximum density of a tract would be 100 dwelling units (or single
family lots), a developer who chooses to construct 10 affordable housing units (or
create 10 affordable housing lots) as part of the development of that tract would
be allowed to construct 10 additional dwelling units (or create 10 additional lots) that
did not satisfy the “affordability” criteria set forth in subsections (c) or (f), for a total
density of 120 dwelling units (or lots). In this illustration, the maximum possible
density that could be achieved would be 150 dwelling units if the developer constructed
at least 25 affordable housing units (or created 25 affordable housing lots).
(AMENDED 1/27/15)
(j) For purposes of determining the maximum density permissible within a development
under subsection (i) of this section, the Board of Aldermen may allow the
payment of an affordable housing payment in lieu fee (determined in accordance
with the provisions of subsection 15-54.1(b)(4)) to be regarded as the equivalent
of providing an affordable housing unit. The developer may request such authorization
at any time following the submission of a development application. In exercising
its discretion as to whether such a request should be granted, the Board shall
Art. XII DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
Page #11
consider the need for the particular type of units the payments in lieu would replace,
the comparative need for cash resources to assist in the provision or maintenance of
affordable housing, and such other factors as the Board deems relevant in determining
whether and to what extent payments in lieu would better serve the Board’s goal
of providing and maintaining affordable housing. (AMENDED 1/22/08, 1/27/15)
(k) Within any development that provides affordable housing units or affordable
housing lots, the minimum area that must be set aside as open space to satisfy the
requirements of Section 15-198 may be reduced by an amount equal to twice the
land area consumed by all such affordable housing units or lots, except in no case
may the required percentage of open space be less than 20 % (10 % in the ORMU
and R-2 districts). (AMENDED 1/27/15)
(l) Affordable housing units or lots constructed or created in accordance with this
section shall not be unduly isolated or segregated from other dwellings or lots
that do not satisfy the “affordability” criteria set forth in this section. (AMENDED
1/27/15)
(m) In approving a special or conditional use permit for a development that proposes
to utilize the density bonus provisions of this section, the permit issuing authority
shall ensure, by approval of a condition, phasing schedule, or otherwise,
that affordable housing units or lots, or payments in lieu thereof, are actually
provided in accordance with the provisions of this section. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the permit issuing authority may impose a condition
specifying that certificates of occupancy may not be issued for the market
priced units until the corresponding affordable housing units are constructed and
offered for sale or rent for an amount that is consistent with the definition set forth
in this section, or payments in lieu thereof have been made to the town.
(AMENDED 1/22/08, 1/27/15)
(n) If, by using the affordable housing density bonus provided for in this section, the
number of dwelling units or lots within a development increases to the point where
the type of permit required for the project based on the number of units or lots would
otherwise change from a zoning to a special use permit or from a special use to a
conditional use permit in accordance with the provisions of Section 15-147, the developer
may nevertheless seek approval for the project under the permit process that
would be applicable if no density bonus was sought under this section. (AMENDED
1/27/15)
(o) As provided in subsection 15-92.1(d), developments that use the affordable
housing density bonus provisions of this section may be entitled to relief from the
setback requirements under some circumstances. (AMENDED 1/27/15)
(p) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, with respect to a development
that (i) was approved prior to the amendments to this section adopted on
June 26, 2007, and (ii) constructed dwelling units that satisfied the affordability
criteria by recording covenants and including restrictions in the deeds that
conveyed title to the affordable units limiting the sale or resale price of such units in
accordance with a formula set forth in this section, and (iii) took advantage of the
Art. XII DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
Page #12
density bonus provisions of this section and constructed additional market rate units
as authorized by this section:
(1) The Board of Aldermen may amend the conditional use permit that authorized
such development to provide that those provisions that restrict the price
at which the affordable units may be sold shall no longer be binding, (thereby allowing
the units to be sold at market value) subject to and in accordance with the
following provisions:
a. At the closing on the sale of such units, all fees and charges typically
paid by the seller of other market rate units (such as loans secured by property,
re-al estate commissions, prorated property taxes, excise taxes, etc.)
shall be paid by the seller of a unit previously designated as affordable. The
balance of the proceeds of the sale to which the seller is entitled shall be referred
to in this section as the “net proceeds of the sale.”
b. To the extent that the price paid by the buyer of the unit exceeds the
price paid by the seller when the seller purchased the unit, the difference between
the two figures shall be referred to in this section as the “equity appreciation
amount.” To the extent that the net proceeds of the sale are sufficient,
the seller shall be allowed to keep the first five thousand dollars ($5,000.00)
of equity appreciation, plus an amount of the equity appreciation equal to the
amount paid by the seller for additions to the home or significant upgrades to
the home (routine maintenance, repairs, or replacements excluded).
c. If the net proceeds of the sale exceed the amount the seller is permitted
to retain under the foregoing paragraph, the remainder of the net proceeds
shall be split evenly between the Town and the seller. (AMENDED
1/27/15)
(2) The Board of Aldermen may also amend the conditional use permit that authorized
such development to provide that those provisions that restrict the price at
which the affordable units may be sold shall expire automatically on the twentieth
anniversary of the recording date of the deed conveying the affordable unit to the
party owning that unit on the effective date of this subsection. Thereafter, no restrictions
on the sales price of such unit or the disposition of sales proceeds shall
apply to such unit. (AMENDED 1/27/15)
(3) A development wherein affordable units are converted to market rate units
under this subsection shall not be regarded as nonconforming with respect to
density. (AMENDED 06/24/14, 1/27/15)
Section 15-183 Minimum Lot Widths.
(a) No lot may be created that is so narrow or otherwise so irregularly shaped that it
would be impracticable to construct on it a building that:
Art. XII DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
Page #13
(1) Could be used for purposes that are permissible in that zoning district; and
(2) Could satisfy any applicable setback requirements for that district.
(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing standard, the following minimum
lot widths are recommended and are deemed presumptively to satisfy the standard
set forth in subsection (a). The lot width shall be measured along a straight line
connecting the points at which a line that demarcates the required setback from the
street intersects with lot boundary lines at opposite sides of the lot. (AMENDED

Art. XII DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
Page #14
(a) Subject to Section 15-187 (Architecturally Integrated Subdivisions) and the other
provisions of this section, no portion of any building or any freestanding sign may
be located on any lot closer to any lot line or to the street right-of-way line or
centerline than is authorized in the table set forth below: (AMENDED 1/22/85)
(1) If the street right-of-way line is readily determinable (by reference to a
recorded map, set irons, or other means), the setback shall be measured from
such right-of-way line. If the right-of-way line is not so determinable, the
setback shall be measured from the street centerline.
(2) As used in this section, the term “lot boundary line” refers to lot boundaries
other than those that abut streets.
(3) As used in this section, the term “building” includes any substantial
structure, which, by nature of its size, scale, dimensions, bulk, or use tends
to constitute a visual obstruction or generate activity similar to that usually
associated with a building. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the following structures shall be deemed to fall within this description:
a. Gas pumps and overhead canopies or roofs.
b. Fences, walls or berms running along lot boundaries adjacent to
public street rights-of-way if such fences, walls or berms exceed
three feet in height and are substantially opaque except that fences,
walls or berms shall not be regarded as “buildings” within the
meaning of this subsection if they are located along the rear lot line
of lots that have street frontage along both the front and rear of such
lots. (AMENDED 05/19/98)
c. Pergolas, except that a pergola will not be considered a “building”
for purposes of this section if it consists merely of an insubstantial
frame, no larger than 15 feet long on any side, presents itself visually
more as a part of the landscape than as a building. (AMENDED
10/22/13)
d. Facilities that house and/or contain domesticated livestock except
that the building setbacks for rabbits and fowl shall adhere to the
requirements in Chapter 10, Article III, Domesticated Livestock and
Wild Animals, of the Town Code. (AMENDED 02/28/17)
(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, signs that do not meet
the definition of freestanding signs may be erected on or affixed to
structures (e.g., some fences) that are not subject to the setback
requirements applicable to buildings only if such signs are located such that
they satisfy the setback requirements applicable to freestanding signs in the
district where located. (AMENDED 5/26/81; 12/7/83; 2/4/86; 11/14/88;

Agreement:
Art. XII DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
Page #16
(1) The minimum set back distance from the lot boundary line shall be 15 feet
rather than the 20 feet indicated in the table set forth in subsection (a);
(2) On lots having frontage on more than one street, the building setback
applicable to the street which the front of the principal building located on
that lot faces shall be as set forth in subsection (a). The building setback
from the other streets shall be 15 feet from the right-of-way line.
(AMENDED 04/25/89)
(c) Whenever a lot in a nonresidential district has a common boundary line with a lot
in a residential district, then the lot in the nonresidential district shall be required
to observe the property line setback requirements applicable to the adjoining
residential lot.
(d) Setback distances shall be measured from the property line or street centerline to a
point on the lot that is directly below the nearest extension of any part of the
building that is substantially a part of the building itself and not a mere appendage to
it (such as a flagpole, etc.). Setbacks for berms shall be measured from the property
line or street centerline to the point on the berm where it exceeds three feet in
height. (AMENDED 05/19/98)
(e) Whenever a private road that serves more than three lots or more than three
dwelling units or that serves any nonresidential use tending to generate traffic
equivalent to more than three dwelling units is located along a lot boundary, then:
(1) If the lot is not also bordered by a public street, buildings and freestanding
signs shall be set back from the centerline of the private road just as if such
road were a public street.
(2) If the lot is also bordered by a public street, then the setback distance on lots
used for residential purposes (as set forth above in the column labeled
“Minimum Distance from Lot Boundary Line”) shall be measured from the
inside boundary of the traveled portion of the private road.
(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, on lots in residential zones used
for residential purposes, a maximum of one accessory building may be located in the
rear yard of such lot without regard to the setback requirements otherwise applicable
to the rear lot boundary line if such accessory building does not exceed fifteen feet
in height or contain more than 150 square feet of gross floor area. (AMENDED

line for buildings or freestanding signs shall be required from any railroad
right-of-way or other railroad property being used principally as a track bed or
corridor. (AMENDED 2/4/86)
(k) In addition to the overall density restrictions of the underlying zone, each mobile
home unit in any mobile home community (use classification 1.122 or 1.123) must
be placed such that it is at least 10 feet in any direction from any other mobile home
unit within the community, in order to reduce the likelihood of the spread of fire.
(AMENDED 10/20/87)
(l) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) or (b), properties located in
Carrboro’s Transition Area II, and zoned R-R shall be required to maintain a
100-foot undisturbed, naturally vegetated setback along any common boundary
line with Properties in Orange County’s planning jurisdiction that are designated
both Rural Buffer and Public/Private Open Space on the Joint Planning Area Land
Use Plan. No structures or associated clearing shall be permitted within this
setback. Utilities and associated clearing shall be permitted within this setback
only to the extent that no reasonable alternative exists. (AMENDED 06/05/89)
(m) When the neighborhood preservation district commission determines that an
application for a permit under this ordinance involves a proposed authentic
restoration, new construction or reconstruction in the same location and in the
original conformation of a structure within a neighborhood preservation district that
has architectural or historic significance, but that such proposed restoration,
construction or reconstruction cannot reasonably be accomplished in conformity
with the setback requirements set forth in this section, the neighborhood
preservation district commission may recommend, and the permit issuing authority
may allow, a deviation from these requirements to the extent reasonably necessary
to accommodate such restoration, construction or reconstruction. (AMENDED
09/26/89)
(n) Signs erected in connection with elections or political campaigns, as described in
subsection 15-273(a)(5), shall not be subject to the setback requirements of this
section. However, as provided in subsection 15-273(a)(5), such signs may not be
attached to any natural or man-made permanent structure located within a public
right-of-way, including without limitation trees, utility poles, or traffic control signs.
(AMENDED 08/25/92)
(o) When the appearance commission determines that (i) any new construction or any
repair, renovation, or reconstruction of a pre-existing building is proposed within
Art. XII DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS

any commercial zoning district; and (ii) the appearance of the building would be
substantially improved by the addition of or extension of an architectural feature;
and (iii) the feature proposed by the appearance commission would violate the
setback provisions of this section, then, subject to the following requirements, the
commission may recommend, and upon such recommendation the applicant may
amend his plans to propose and the permit issuing authority may authorize, an
encroachment of such architectural feature into the required setback area.
(1) For purposes of this subsection, the term “architectural feature” includes any
part of a building other than a building wall or mechanical appurtenance.
(2) The maximum encroachment that can be authorized under this subsection is
two feet.
(3) The encroachment may be allowed when the appearance commission and
permit issuing authority both conclude that authorization of the
encroachment would result in a building that is more compatible with the
surrounding neighborhood than would be the case if the encroachment were
not allowed. (AMENDED 11/09/93)
(p) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, in the historic district, no
portion of any new dwelling unit on a flag lot may be located any closer than fifteen
(15) feet from any property line or any closer than thirty (30) feet from any existing
dwelling unit located on the lot from which the flag lot was created (see Section 15-
175.10). (AMENDED 11/21/95)
(q) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, the base of a use classification
18.200 tower shall be set back from a street right-of-way line and a lot boundary
lane a distance that is not less than the height of the tower. (AMENDED 02/18/97)
(r) Notwithstanding any provision in this section with respect to use classification
1.340, single-room occupancy buildings may be set back from a street right-of-way
line a distance that is consistent with the setbacks of other nearby buildings that
front the same street. (AMENDED 01/11/00)
Section 15-185 Building Height Limitations (AMENDED 9/13/83; 2/4/86; 11/14/88; 4/8/03;
6/22/04; 8/23/05; 10/25/05)
(a) Subject to the remaining provisions of this chapter:
(1) No building in any of the following zoning districts may exceed a height of
thirty-five feet R-3, R-7.5, R-10, R-15, R-20, RR, C, B-5, M-2, WM-3, O, O/A,
and HR-R (AMENDED 10/22/19).
(2) No building in any of the zoning districts listed in the following table may
Art. XII DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
Page #19
exceed the height indicated.

(3) Buildings in the B-1(c) and the B-1(g) districts may be constructed to a
maximum height of three stories where the lot on which the building is located
abuts a street right-of-way of fifty feet or less and four stories where the lot on
which the building is located abuts a street right-of-way of more than fifty feet
or where the lot is located at least fifty feet from the nearest public street rightof-
way, except that:
a. If a property owner whose property in a B-1(c) or B-l(g) district abuts a
street right-of-way of fifty feet or less dedicates additional right-of-way
to more that fifty feet, then the developer of a building on such property
may take advantage of the additional height authorized under this
subsection for buildings on lots that abut street rights-of-way of more
than fifty feet, so long as such dedication occurs before a building permit
is issued for a building that takes advantage of such additional height.
b. If a building in a B-1(c) or B-l (g) district is located on a lot that abuts
more than one street, then for purposes of determining the height limit
under this subsection, the lot shall be treated as if it abutted only the
street having the narrowest right-of-way.
c. The maximum building height authorized in the first sentence of
Subsection (a)(3) of this section may be increased by one story, up to a
maximum height of five stories, for every ten feet that the additional
story is set back from the street right-of-way beyond the setback
specified in Section 15-184.
d. Any portion of a building (located on lots within a B-l ( c ) or B-1 (g)
district) that exceeds thirty-five feet in height must be set back from the
property line of any adjoining residentially zoned lot as least a distance
Art. XII DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
Page #20
equal to twice the lot boundary line setback requirement applicable to
such adjoining lot.
.
e. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, no building in
excess of two stories shall be permitted on (i) any lot within the Town’s
National Register Commercial District upon which there exists on the
effective date of this subsection s contributing building, or (ii) any lot
upon which there exists on the effective date of this subsection a
building listed on the National Register of Historic Places, if, after the
effective date of this subsection, such contributing building or building
listed on the National Register of Historic Places is demolished. This
limitation shall not apply to the relocation of such building to another
lot. For purposes of this subsection, a “contributing building” is a
building or structure within the boundaries of the district that adds to the
historic associations, historic architectural qualities, or archaeological
values for which the historic district is significant. A contributing
building must also retain its “integrity.” In other words, the property
must retain enough of its historic physical features to convey its
significance as part of the district. Alterations can damage a property’s
historic appearance and its integrity.
(4) Regardless of whether a building in a B-1 (c) or B-l (g) district is set back from
the street beyond the setback specified in Section 15-184, if a mansard, gable, or
gambrel roof substantially conceals the existence of a story (i.e. the height of the
space that constitutes the story is provided primarily by the roof the building
rather than vertical exterior walls), that story shall not be counted toward the
maximum number of stories otherwise allowed under this section, except that in
no case shall the maximum building height (including the story contained within
the mansard, gable, or gambrel roof) exceed five stories in the B-l (c ) or B-l (g)
district.
(b) Subject to subsections (c) and (d) the features listed in this subsection, when attached
to a principal building, may be constructed to a height that does not exceed the lesser
of (i) 120% of the district height limitation set forth in subsection (a), or (ii) the
district height limitation set forth in subsection (a) plus fifteen feet. By way of
illustration, in a zoning district with a height limitation of thirty-five feet, the
following features may be constructed to a height of forty-two feet, but such features
may not exceed the forty-two feet height limit even if a height variance has also been
granted for the principal building (unless a variance has also been granted regarding
the height limitation affecting such features.)
(1) Chimneys, church spires, elevator shafts, and similar structural appendages
not intended as places of occupancy or storage;
(2) Flagpoles and similar devices;
Art. XII DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
Page #21
(3) Heating and air conditioning equipment, solar collectors, and similar
equipment, fixtures and devices.
(c) The exceptions set forth in subsection (b) to the height limitations set forth in
subsection (a) shall not be allowed if and to the extent that the permit issuing
authority, or the board of adjustment if the permit-issuing authority is the zoning
administrator, concludes that such exception(s) would materially interfere with the
legitimate use and enjoyment of neighboring properties (including public properties
or rights-of-way) or would otherwise pose a danger to the public health and safety.
(d) The features listed in subsection (b) may exceed the height limitation set forth in
subsection (a) only in accordance with the following requirements:
(1) Not more than one-third of the total roof area may be consumed by such
features.
(2) The features described in subdivision (b)(3) above must be set back from the
edge of the roof a minimum distance of one foot for every foot by which
such features extend above the roof surface of the principal building to
which they are attached.
(3) Enclosures for any of the features set forth in subsection (b) may not
surround a greater area than is reasonably necessary to enclose such features.
(4) The permit issuing authority may authorize or require that parapet walls be
constructed (up to a height not exceeding that of the features screened) to
shield the features listed in subdivisions (b)(1) and (3) from view.
(e) Towers and antennas shall not be subject to the maximum height limitations set forth in
this section but shall be governed by the restrictions inherent on the definitions of such
uses as well as the other provisions of this chapter applicable to use classification
18.000. The height of a tower or antenna attached to a structure other than an antenna
shall be the vertical distance measured from the main elevation of the finished grade at
the front of the building or structure to which the tower is attached to the top of the
tower (or antenna, if the antenna extends above the tower). (AMENDED 02/18/97)
(f) Notwithstanding the remaining provisions of this section, the maximum building
height for structures utilized for 5.100 use classifications, elementary and secondary
schools, may be increased to not more than 50 feet when the permit issuing authority
concludes that the additional height is necessary to accommodate specific building
elements (e.g. auditorium and support facilities) or to accommodate building designs
that seek to minimize building footprints and/or maximize natural lighting.
(AMENDED 6/22/04)

(g) For purposes of this section:(AMENDED 06/28/94; 04/08/03)
1) Subject to subsection (g) (2), the height of a building shall be the vertical
distance measured from the mean elevation of the finished grade at the front
of the building to the highest point of the building.
2) With respect to single-family detached residences, the height of a building
shall be the vertical distance measured from the floor of the main story of
the residence at the front elevation to the top of the roof above the floor.
3) The terms “story” and “floor” are defined in Section 15-15. (AMENDED
04/08/03)
(h) Within the B-1(C), zoning district, all buildings constructed after the effective date
of this subsection shall contain at least two stories if such buildings contain more
than 1,000 square feet of gross floor area.
Within the B-1(C) zoning district, all new additions to existing buildings shall contain
at least two stories if such additions amount to 25% or more of the square footage
of the gross floor area of the pre-existing building. (AMENDED 04/23/13)
Section 15-185.1 Downtown Neighborhood Protection Overlay District Requirements
(AMENDED 8/23/05)
(a) Lots that are within the Downtown Neighborhood Protection (DNP) Overlay District
shall be subject to the requirements of this section.
(b) Within the DNP district, the portion of any lot so zoned that lies within 50 feet of a
boundary line that abuts or is located directly across the street from residentially zoned property,
other than property that is zoned R-2, shall constitute an area referred to in this section as the
DNP Buffer Area.
(c) Within the DNP Buffer Area:
(1) A building or buildings constructed within such buffer area may not extend
laterally along the affected boundary for more than 80% of the lot width at its
narrowest point within the buffer area; and
(2) The maximum horizontal run of a single building shall be 80 feet; and
(3) If more than one building is constructed, there shall be a separation of at least
30 feet between one building and another.
Art. XII DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
Page #23
(d) With respect to lots where the underlying zoning is B-1(c) or B-1(g), the provisions of
Subsection 15-185(a)(3) shall not apply and the provisions of subsections (f), (g) and (h) of this
section shall apply in lieu thereof. (AMENDED 1/23/07).
(1) A third story not exceeding a building height of 42 feet shall be permissible if a
gable, or gambrel roof with a roof pitch no greater than 70 degrees and a continuous
eave line substantially contains the third story (i.e. the height of the space that
constitutes the story is provided primarily by the roof of the building rather than
vertical exterior walls). When dormers are constructed on such roofs, the total
width of all such dormers shall not exceed two-thirds of the width of the roof on
which such dormers are constructed. (AMENDED 2/27/07).
(2) A third story shall be permissible if:
a. All portions of such third story are set back at least ten feet from the second
story façade of the building wall that faces a boundary line that abuts
or is located directly across the street from residentially zoned property.
(3) Towers, cupolas, and similar architectural features intended to complement the
building design may extend to a height of not more than 42 feet, so long as such
features do not contain more than 400 square feet and no elevational width of such
features exceeds 25 feet.
(e) With respect to lots where the underlying zoning is B-1(c) or B-1(g), the provisions of
Subsection 15-185(a)(3) shall not apply and the provisions of subsections (f), (g) and (h) of this
section shall apply in lieu thereof.
(f) With respect to lots where the underlying zoning is B-1(c) or B-1(g), the portion of such
lots within the DNP Buffer Area shall be subject to a maximum height limitation of two stories,
except as set forth below: (AMENDED 1/23/07).
(1) A third story not exceeding a building height of 42 feet shall be permissible if
a gable, or gambrel roof with a roof pitch no greater than 70 degrees and a
continuous eave line substantially contains the third story (i.e. the height of the
space that constitutes the story is provided primarily by the roof of the building
rather than vertical exterior walls). When dormers are constructed on such
roofs, the total width of all such dormers shall not exceed two-thirds of the
width of the roof on which such dormers are constructed. (AMENDED
2/27/07)
(2) A third story shall be permissible if:
a. All portions of such third story are set back at least ten feet from the second
story façade of the building wall that faces a boundary line that abuts
Art. XII DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
Page #24
or is located directly across the street from residentially zoned property;
and
(3) Towers, cupolas, and similar architectural features intended to complement the
building design may extend to a height of not more than 42 feet, so long as such
features do not contain more than 400 square feet and no elevational width of such
features exceeds 25 feet.
(g) With respect to lots where the underlying zoning is B-1(c) or B-1(g), the portion of
such lots that lie outside the DNP Buffer Area shall be subject to a maximum height
limitation of three stories except as set forth below:
(1) A fourth story may be constructed if such fourth story is either set back at least
ten feet from the edge of the DNP Buffer Area or is substantially contained
within a mansard, gable, or gambrel roof with a roof pitch no greater than seventy
degrees and a continuous eave line (i.e. the height of the space that constitutes
the story is provided primarily by the roof of the building rather than vertical
exterior walls).
(2) If a fifth story is constructed, either all portions of such fifth story must be set
back at least ten feet from the fourth story façade of the building wall that faces
a boundary line that abuts or is located directly across the street from residentially
zoned property, or the fifth story must be substantially contained within a
mansard, gable, or gambrel roof with a roof pitch no greater than seventy degrees
and a continuous eave line (i.e. the height of the space that constitutes the
story is provided primarily by the roof of the building rather than vertical exterior
walls).
(3) In addition, if a fifth story is constructed, either all portions of such fifth story
must be set back from any street right-of way line other than that associated
with establishing the DNP buffer area a distance of ten feet beyond the setback
specified in Section 15-184, or the fifth story must be substantially contained
within a mansard, gable, or gambrel roof with a roof pitch no greater than seventy
degrees and a continuous eave line (i.e. the height of the space that constitutes
the story is provided primarily by the roof of the building rather than vertical
exterior walls).
(h) Notwithstanding the permit requirements established in Sections 15-146 and 15-147,
if a developer proposes to construct within those areas of the DNP district where the underlying
zoning is B-1(c) a building that exceed two stories in height, or where the underlying
zoning is B-1(g) a building that exceeds three stories, a conditional use permit must
be obtained.
Section 15-185.2 Lloyd/Broad Overlay District Requirements (AMENDED 6/26/18)
Art. XII DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
Page #25
(a) Lots within the Lloyd/Broad Overlay District are subject to the requirements of
this Section.
(b) The front yard setback requirement applicable to lots within this District shall be
a minimum of 15 feet and a maximum of 25 feet from the right-of-way.
(c) The maximum height of any structure within this District shall be a vertical
distance of twenty-three (23) feet measured from the floor of the main story
of the residence at the front elevation to the top of the roof above the floor.
Within this District it shall not be permitted to construct habitable basements,
crawl spaces or garages beneath the finished first floor of the dwelling unit.
Increased setback distances for upper stories are encouraged. So long as all
other overlay district requirements are met, a legally nonconforming roof
height in a residential structures existing at the time of adoption of this ordinance
may be extended to a new addition to the residential structure
(d) Within this District, the maximum size of new dwellings shall not exceed 1,750
square feet. Dwellings existing at the time of adoption of this ordinance, greater
than 1,200 square feet in size may be expanded up to 2,000 square feet.
Dwellings existing as the time of adoption of this ordinance greater than 1,199
square feet or less may be expanded up to 1,750 square feet.
(e) Within this District, each improved lot must have at least two parking spaces.
Parking areas shall be configured to provide direct access to individual spaces,
without the need for excessive stacking, and, to the extent practicable, parking
areas shall not be allowed between the building façade and the street right-of
way.
(f) Within this District, the number of unrelated individuals occupying a single
dwelling unit shall be limited to four. Individuals related by blood, marriage
or other legal arrangement shall not be subject to this limitation.
Section 15-186 Cluster Subdivisions.
(a) In any single-family residential subdivision in the zones indicated below, a
developer may create lots that are smaller than those required by Subsection
15-181 if such developer complies with the provisions of this section and if the
lots created are not smaller than the minimums set forth in the following table:
ZONE MINIMUM SQUARE FEET
R-7.5 5,625
R-10 7,500
R-S.I.R. 7,500
R-15 11,250

Art. XII DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
Page #26
RR 20,000 (AMENDED 11/14/88)
WR 43,560 (AMENDED 05/19/90)
(b) The intent of this section is to authorize the developer to decrease lot sizes and
leave the land “saved” by so doing as usable open space, thereby lowering
development costs and increasing the amenity of the project without increasing
the density beyond what would be permissible if the land were subdivided into the
size lots required by Section 15-181.
(c) The amount of usable open space that must be set aside shall be determined by:
(1) Subtracting from the standard square footage requirement set forth in
Section 15-181 the amount of square footage of each lot that is smaller than
that standard;
(2) Adding together the results obtained in (1) for each lot.
(a) The provisions of this section may only be used if the usable open space set aside in
a subdivision comprises at least 10,000 square feet of space that satisfies the
definition of usable open space set forth in Section 15-198 and if such usable open
space is otherwise in compliance with the provisions of Article XIII. (AMENDED
06/27/95; REPEALED 09/05/95; REDESIGNATED 09/05/95)
(b) The setback requirements of Section 15-184 shall apply in cluster subdivisions.
(AMENDED 06/27/95; REPEALED 09/05/95; REDESIGNATED 09/05/95)
Section 15-187 Architecturally Integrated Subdivisions.
(a) In any architecturally integrated subdivision, the developer may create lots and
construct buildings without regard to any minimum lot size or setback restrictions
except that: (AMENDED 2/22/83; 4/24/84)
(1) Lot boundary setback requirements shall apply where and to the extent that
the subdivided tract abuts land that is not part of the subdivision; and
(2) Each lot shall be of sufficient size and dimensions that it can support the
structure proposed to be located on it, consistent with all other applicable
requirements of this chapter.
(b) The number of dwelling units in an architecturally integrated subdivision may not
exceed the maximum density authorized for the tract under Section 15-182.
(AMENDED 06/27/95; 06/22/99)
(c) The amount of land “saved” by creating lots that are smaller than the standards set
forth in Section 15-181 shall be set aside as open space except that in no case
Art. XII DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
Page #27
shall a development be required to preserve more than forty percent of the development
tract as open space. (AMENDED 06/27/95)
(d) The purpose of this section is to provide flexibility, consistent with the public
health and safety and without increasing overall density to the developer who subdivides
property and constructs buildings on the lots created in accordance with a
unified and coherent plan of development. (REDESIGNATED 06/27/95)
(e) The Board of Aldermen may approve a conversion to an architecturally integrated
subdivision of any multi-family project that was built in accordance with the standards
of the zoning ordinance in effect at the time of construction despite the fact that
the density of such project exceeds that permissible under this chapter. However, no
increase in density may be allowed in connection with such conversion. (REDESIGNATED
06/27/95)
(f) Architecturally integrated subdivisions shall not be allowed in the C or WR zoning
districts. (REDESIGNATED 06/27/95)
Section 15-188 Restrictions Designed to Mandate the Construction of Some Smaller
New Homes for Sale (AMENDED 06/22/99; 03/23/04)
(a) The Board finds that:
(1) Construction of new, single-family homes within the town’s planning jurisdiction
in recent years has been limited almost exclusively to homes that
exceed 1,350 square feet in heated floor area and/or that sell for prices in
excess of $ 175,000;
(2) It is in the public interest to have available within the town’s planning jurisdiction
a diversity of new housing stock such that at least some newly
constructed single-family homes are potentially affordable to families other
than those in the highest income brackets;
(3) The objective of providing some diversity in terms of the affordability of
new housing stock within the town’s planning jurisdiction as described
above can be advanced by mandating that a certain percentage of the
homes within new subdivisions be limited to not more than 1,350 square
feet in heated floor area.
(b) Subject to the remaining provisions of this section, every residential development
containing between thirteen and twenty units for sale shall be developed in such a
manner that at least fifteen percent of the dwelling units constructed within such subdivision
contain not more than 1,350 square feet of heated floor area at the time such
units are initially conveyed, and an additional ten percent of the dwelling units contain
not more than 1,100 square feet of heated floor area at the time such units are iniArt.
XII DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
Page #28
tially conveyed. Every residential development containing twenty-one or more units
for sale shall be developed in such a manner that at least fifteen percent of the dwelling
units constructed within such development contain not more than 1,100 square
feet of heated floor area at the time such units are initially conveyed, and an additional
ten percent of the dwelling units contain not more than 1,350 square feet of heated
floor area at the time such units are initially conveyed. For purposes of this subsection
the term “heated floor area” means any fully enclosed (not merely screened in or
partially enclosed) space that is within or attached to a dwelling unit, where either (i)
the room temperature of such space is controlled or affected by a man-made heating
or cooling device, or (ii) such space, although unheated, is clearly designed to be living
space (as opposed to storage space or a garage) and can readily be converted into
a heated living area. Such units shall be referred to in this section as “size-limited
units.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, the requirement for size-limited units shall not
apply to residential developments located in the R-R or W-R zoning districts.
(c) The number of dwelling units that can be constructed within an architecturally integrated
subdivision or un-subdivided development is determined at the time the conditional
use permit is approved. With respect to residential subdivisions other than architecturally
integrated subdivisions, each lot that is large enough for only a single
dwelling unit or that is limited by restrictive covenants to development only with a
single dwelling unit shall be deemed to house one single-family detached dwelling
unit. Lots that are large enough to accommodate more than one dwelling unit and are
not so limited by restrictive covenants shall be deemed to house the largest number of
duplex or multi-family units that could be approved under this chapter. The minimum
number of size-limited units shall then be determined by multiplying the maximum
number of dwelling units permissible within the subdivision as determined
herein by the percentage specified in subsection (b) above (resulting fractions shall be
dropped).
(d) The developer’s plans submitted with the application for a conditional use permit
shall indicate which lots in the case of residential subdivisions or which units in the
case of un-subdivided residential developments the developer proposes to develop
with size-limited units. The conditional use permit plans and any necessary final
plats shall indicate clearly where a size-limited unit must be constructed, and, in the
case of subdivisions subject to the provisions of subsection (e), purchasers of lots
shall be bound by the limitation.
(e) No zoning or building permit may be issued for the construction of any dwelling unit
on any lot that has been designated as a lot on which a size-limited unit must be constructed
unless the dwelling conforms to the limitations of this section. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this section shall not prevent the purchaser of any size-limited
unit, or any successor to such purchaser, from enlarging the dwelling unit at any time
following one year after the issuance of the initial certificate of occupancy for the
unit.
Art. XII DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS
Page #29
(f) This section shall not apply to any subdivision where each of the lots so created contains
on the date the final plat is approved a dwelling unit for which a certificate of
occupancy had been issued at least three years prior to the date of final plat approval.
Nor shall this section apply to modifications of previously approved subdivisions.
(g) Size-limited units may not be located apart from the remainder of the development in
any manner designed to isolate such units or discourage the residents of such units
from full participation in the enjoyment of all facilities and common properties available
to other residents of the development.
(h) This section shall not apply to the development of land that, on the effective date of
this section, was subject to restrictive covenants that preclude the construction of
dwellings as those prescribed in this section.
(i) This section shall not apply to the development of land for which a conditional or
special use permit authorizing the development of such land was approved prior to
the effective date of this section.
(j) A residential development that provides at least 85 percent of the maximum number
of affordable housing units available under the provision of Section 15-182.4 (Residential
Density Bonuses for Affordable Housing) shall not be subject to the requirements
of this section.

RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND OPEN SPACE
Section 15-196 Active Recreational Areas and Facilities Required (AMENDED 5/10/83;
4/24/84; 12/10/85; 10/22/13)
(a) Subject to subsection (d) and Sections 15-197 and 15-203, all residential
developments shall provide active recreational areas and facilities to such an extent that the sum
total of recreation points assigned to each recreational area and facility [under subsection (b)] equals
or exceeds the number of recreation points required of that development in accordance with the
remaining provisions of this section.
(b) For purposes of this section, a recreation point is a unit of measurement that allows
various types of recreational areas and facilities to be compared to one another. As set forth more
fully in Appendix G to this chapter, the principal criterion upon which recreation points are
assigned to various facilities is the cost associated with the development of such facilities. The
following table establishes the recreation points assignable to the facilities listed. Points for
facilities not included in the table below shall be determined by the permit issuing authority by
applying the methodology set forth in Appendix G.

(c) The minimum total of recreation points required of any development shall equal the
sum of the recreation points assigned to each type of dwelling unit or lot proposed for that
development in accordance with the following (The methodology for determining the assignment
of recreation points to residential type is set forth in Appendix G.):
TYPE OF RESIDENCE
(By Use Classification)
POINTS PER DWELLING UNIT
1.100 Single Family detached 10.39
1.120 Includes mobile home parks 11.25
1.200 Two-family residences 10.39
1.300 Multi-family residences
One Bedroom
Two Bedroom
Three or more Bedroom
5.94
9.47
11.81
1.34 Single-Room Occupancy 2.97
With respect to residential subdivisions other than architecturally integrated subdivisions, each lot
that is large enough for only a single dwelling unit or that is limited by restrictive covenants to
development only with a single dwelling unit shall be deemed to house one single-family detached
dwelling unit. Subject to Section 15-197, lots that are large enough to accommodate more than one
dwelling unit and are not so limited by restrictive covenants shall be deemed to house the largest
number of two-bedroom multi-family units that could be approved under this chapter.
(AMENDED 10/10/00)
(d) The Board recognizes that some developments will contain such a small number of
dwelling units that the active recreational areas and facilities required pursuant to this section would
be of minimal practical value and that maintenance of such areas for so small a development would
likely prove problematic. Therefore, the following types of residential developments shall not be
required to provide active recreational areas and facilities under this section but shall be required to
pay to the town’s open space and recreational facilities fund a fee in lieu thereof in accordance with
Section 15-203 if the town determines that it will be feasible to provide active recreational areas
and facilities on land that can reasonably be expected to serve the residents of such developments:
(1) Unsubdivided developments that are small enough so that the minimum
amount of recreation points required of such developments is not more than
80. (AMENDED 2/24/87)
(2) Subdivided residential developments of less than fifteen dwelling units.
(AMENDED 06/27/95)
(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term “development” refers to the entire
project developed on a single tract or contiguous multiple tracts under
common ownership or control, regardless of whether the development is
constructed in phases or stages. (AMENDED 2/24/87)
Art. XIII RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND OPEN SPACE
Page #3
(e) If the proposed development contains land subject to the provisions of 15-198(e),
then a bike and pedestrian path that has the potential of connecting with similar type facilities on
adjoining tracts that also have lands subject to the provisions of 15-198(e) shall be provided
within this area, unless the permit issuing authority concludes that such a bike and pedestrian
path would be environmentally undesirable or economically unfeasible. (AMENDED 06/27/95)
(f) Play equipment suitable for children under 12 should comprise at least 10% of the
total required recreation points of single-family units and 5% of the points required of multi-family
units in a development. Residential developments consisting of solely single-room occupancy units
shall be exempt from the requirement to provide play equipment suitable for children.
(AMENDED ON 10/10/00)
(g) Active recreational facilities and areas should be located throughout the
development so that they can be reached safely and easily by their anticipated users. Such facilities
and areas should be on land that is suitable for the intended use, have a minimum of 1200 square
feet per area, and be sufficiently screened to minimize the impacts on adjacent residences.
(h) When the cost of the land associated with recreational facilities is included in
calculating the recreational points for such facilities under this section, then such land may
generally not also be credited toward the fulfillment of the mandatory open space requirements
set forth under Section 15-198. Exceptions to this policy are as follows:
(1) Play fields, including without limitation baseball fields, soccer fields, and
football fields;
(2) Bike and pedestrian paths constructed pursuant to subsection (e) of this
section. (Only the area that is within the width of the dedicated easement
for the bike and pedestrian area is subject to the double counting
provision.)

(i) (AMENDED 4/8/03; REPEALED 6/12/07)
Section 15-197 Exception to Recreational Facilities and Open Space Requirements.
(a) If an application is submitted for a subdivision and the application does not also
seek approval for the development of improvements to the subdivision (such as the extension of
water and sewer facilities or the creation of public streets or private roads) or the construction of
buildings or other substantial improvements on any lot so subdivided, then the Board (for a major
subdivision) or the planning director (for a minor subdivision) may approve the subdivision without
requiring the provision of active recreational areas and facilities (Section 15-196) or the provision
of usable open space (Section 15-198) if the subdivision approval authority finds that the property
is being subdivided for purposes other than the desire to accommodate a present plan to develop
any of the lots so created in any manner other than the use as a single-family detached residence.
(AMENDED 10/08/96)
Art. XIII RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND OPEN SPACE

(b) The requirements of this article shall not apply to the reconstruction or
enlargement of pre-existing single-family residential dwelling units or to the reconstruction or
renovation of pre-existing multi-family units, except to the extent that such reconstruction or
renovation of multi-family residences increases the number of dwelling units or bedrooms within
any such residential development. (AMENDED 10/08/96)
Section 15-198 Open Space (AMENDED 04/24/84; 03/26/85; 12/10/85; 11/11/86;
REWRITTEN 06/27/95; 06/20/06; AMENDED 3/24/09; 3/23/10)
(a) The Board finds that when land is developed for residential purposes, the public
health, safety, and welfare are best served when substantial portions of the tracts so developed
remain as common open space. The preservation of such open space areas serves the following
important objectives, to the benefit of the residents of such developments as well as the general
public:
(1) Preservation of open vistas, providing relief from an urban landscape;
(2) Preservation of environmentally sensitive lands;
(3) Preservation of habitat for wildlife;
(4) Preservation of historically or archaeologically significant areas;
(5) Provision of areas for passive recreation, such as walking or jogging.
(b) For purposes of this section:
(1) Open space refers to an area that:
a. Is not encumbered with any substantial structure;
b. Is not devoted to use as a roadway, parking area, or sidewalk;
c. Is not part of any privately owned lot that is used or intended for
use for residential purposes.
d. Is legally and practicably accessible to the general public or to the
residents of the development where the open space is located.
(2) Narrow strips of common area that separate lots within a development
from each other, from streets, or from adjoining tracts shall generally not
be regarded as open space within the meaning of this section unless such
areas:
a. Are at least 50 feet in width and capable of functioning as a
substantial visual buffer; or
Art. XIII RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND OPEN SPACE
Page #5
b. Are configured and/or improved (e.g. through the installation of
trails) in such a way as to be conducive to actual use for passive
recreational purposes (i.e. walking or jogging) by residents of the
development where located.
(3) The following areas shall be regarded as open space if such areas satisfy at
least the criteria set forth in Subdivision (1) a, b, and c of subsection (b) of
this section:
a. Utility easements located outside of street rights of way;
b. Cemeteries located on a tract prior to its development.
c. Areas used for the growing of crops, such as hay, corn, or
vegetables, if and to the extent that such uses occur within an area
that is subject to the control of a homeowners association and such
uses are approved by the homeowners association. (AMENDED
05/25/99)
(4) The term “primary conservation areas” shall mean: (AMENDED 05/25/99;
6/20/99)
a. Areas containing slopes greater than 25%
b. Hardwood areas as designated in the Geographic Information
System (GIS) of the Town of Carrboro. (AMENDED 3/24/09)
c. Wetlands as defined pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act
d. Floodplains
e. Water quality buffers on perennial and intermittent streams.
(AMENDED 3/24/09)
f. Lakes and ponds;
g. Road buffers as required by Section 15-312 of this Chapter, except
for those portions of the buffers that must be included in road or
utility crossings.
(5) The term “secondary conservation areas” shall mean: (AMENDED
05/25/99)
a. Areas containing slopes greater than 15% but not more than 25%;
Art. XIII RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND OPEN SPACE
Page #6
b. Wooded areas other than hardwood areas as designated in the
Geographic Information System (GIS) of the Town of Carrboro.
(AMENDED 3/23/10)
c. Vistas along entranceways to the town;
d. Other areas containing unusual natural features (such as major rock
formations);
e. With respect to streams designated on the adopted Stream
Classification Map of the Town of Carrboro, those areas within an
average perpendicular distance of sixty feet from the edge of the
floodway of the stream, if the floodway is designated on the “Flood
Boundary and Flood Map” prepared by the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development or sixty feet from the centerline
of the stream where the floodway is not designated on the map.
f. Other environmentally, historically, or archaeologically significant
or unique areas, including water quality buffers on ephemeral
streams. (AMENDED 3/24/09)
(c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j) and Section 15-203, every
residential development in zoning districts other than the R-2, ORMU, B-1(c), B-1(G), B-2, and
CT zoning districts shall be developed so that at least forty percent (40 percent) of the total area
of the development remains permanently in open space. Every residential development in the R-
2 and ORMU district shall be developed so that at least twenty percent (20 percent) of the total
area of the development remains permanently as open space. (AMENDED 09/05/95; 06/20/06;
6/12/07)
(d) Subject to subsection (g), every residential development containing at least 25 lots
or dwelling units shall contain, as part of its required open space, one or more areas that are
relatively flat, well drained, grassed, and otherwise well suited for use as a play field:
(1) Each such area shall contain a minimum of 20,000 square feet configured
in such a manner as to be useful as a play field.
(2) Every development covered by this subsection shall set aside in one or
more play fields meeting the criteria of this subsection a minimum of 400
square feet of area per lot or dwelling unit within the development.
(3) Play fields provided under this section shall be located with due regard for
the safety and convenience of those using such facilities as well as the
welfare of residents living nearby. The play fields required by this
subsection shall be located such that 90% of the lots or dwelling units
within any development that is required to install such play field are within
1,500 feet of a play field installed to meet the requirements of this
Art. XIII RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND OPEN SPACE
Page #7
subsection, unless the developer demonstrates by clear and convincing
evidence that adherence to this requirement would not be feasible.
(4) Play fields constructed to meet the requirements of this subsection may be
used by the developer to satisfy the active recreational requirements set
forth in Section 15-196 as well as the open space requirements of this
section. However, the recreation points assigned to such play fields shall
be based upon the actual cost of constructing such play fields, exclusive
of land costs. (AMENDED 05/25/99)
(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the playfield requirement will not apply to
residential mixed use developments located within the OR-MU zoning
district. (AMENDED 6/20/06)
(e) Subject to subsection (g), if a tract where a residential development is proposed
contains any areas defined above as primary conservation areas, then such areas shall be
designated as open space. (AMENDED 05/25/99)
(f) RESERVED (AMENDED 05/25/99)
(g) A developer shall not be required to set aside as open space under the provisions of
subsections (d) and (e) more than the minimum required percentage of open space set forth in
subsection (c). If the sum total of open space otherwise required under the provisions of
subsections (d) and (e) exceeds forty percent of the development tract (twenty percent in the R-2
district), then the permit issuing authority shall allow the developer to set aside a smaller area of
open space under subsections (d) and (e), individually or collectively, so that the developer is not
required to preserve as open space more than forty percent of the development tract (twenty
percent in the R-2 district). However, if areas that constitute primary conservation areas have not
been set aside as open space, then the development plans shall otherwise provide for the
preservation of such areas even though they may be located within privately owned lots (e.g. by
specifying buildable areas within individual lots). Notwithstanding the foregoing, hardwood
areas identified in the Geographic Information System (GIS) of the Town of Carrboro that are
not set aside as common open space shall be preserved except to the extent that removal of such
hardwood trees is necessary to accommodate the permitted uses created out of land not set aside
as common open space. ((AMENDED 09/05/95; 05/25/99; 3/23/10)
(h) If the area of open space required to be preserved under subsections (d) and (e) does
not exceed forty percent (40%) of the area of the development tract (20% in the R-2 district), then
the permit issuing authority may require that the developer set aside from among the areas that
constitute secondary conservation areas as defined above an amount of open space equal to the
difference between the amount of open space preserved under subsections (d) and (e) and forty
percent (40%) of the development tract (20% in the R-2 district). (AMENDED 09/05/95; 05/25/99)
(i) Except as otherwise set forth in this section, the choice as to the areas to be set
aside as open space shall remain with the developer.
Art. XIII RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND OPEN SPACE
Page #8
(j) Subdivided residential developments of less than fifteen dwelling units are
exempt from the requirements of this section unless the town agrees that it will accept an offer of
dedication of such open space, and in that case the offer of dedication shall be made. Subdivided
residential developments exempted by this subsection from the requirement of providing usable
open space shall be required to make a payment in lieu thereof to the town’s open space and
recreational facilities fund in accordance with Section 15-203 if the town determines that it will
be possible to provide usable open space areas that are reasonably expected to benefit or serve
the residents of such developments. For purposes of this subsection, the term “developments”
shall have the same meaning as is set forth in subsection 15-196(d)(3).
(k) Residential developments consisting solely of multi-family, single-room occupancy
units (1.340) shall be exempt from the requirements of this section. (AMENDED 01/11/00)
Section 15-199 Ownership and Maintenance of Recreational Facilities and Open Space Not
Dedicated to the Town (REWRITTEN 06/27/95)
(a) Unless the town requires that recreational facilities or open space be dedicated to
the town or agrees to accept an offer of dedication voluntarily made by the developer, such
recreational facilities and open space shall remain under the ownership and control of the
developer (or his successor) or a homeowners’ association or similar organization that satisfies
the criteria established in Section 15-201. If such recreational facilities and open space are not
publicly dedicated, they shall be made available to all residents of the development under
reasonable rules and regulations established to encourage and govern the use of such facilities
and open space by the residents without payment of separate optional fees or charges other than
membership fees in a homeowners’ association. Such facilities and open space may be made
available to a limited extent on a fee basis to persons who are not residents of the development
where such facilities or open space are located, so long as such use does not become so extensive
as to remove the facilities and open space from the category of an accessory use to a residential
development and transform the use to a separate principal use classification (see use
classification 6.000) under the Table of Permissible Uses.
(b) The person or entity identified in subsection (a) as having the right of ownership
and control over such recreational facilities and open space shall be responsible for the
continuing upkeep and proper maintenance of the same.
Section 15-200 Dedication of Open Space (AMENDED 11/26/85; REWRITTEN 06/27/95;
REPEALED 09/05/95)
Section 15-201 Homeowners’ Association (AMENDED 11/26/85)
Homeowners’ associations or similar legal entities that, pursuant to Section 15-199, are
responsible for the maintenance and control of common areas, including recreational facilities and
open space, shall be established in such a manner that:
(1) Provisions for the establishment of the association or similar entity is made
before any lot in the development is sold or any building occupied;
Art. XIII RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND OPEN SPACE
Page #9
(2) The association or similar legal entity has clear legal authority to maintain
and exercise control over such common areas and facilities;
(3) The association or similar legal entity has the power to compel contributions
from residents of the development to cover their proportionate shares of the
costs associated with the maintenance and upkeep of such common areas
and facilities; and
(4) The association will establish a capital fund for the maintenance and upkeep
of common areas and facilities and a method of contributing to that fund
which will spread the costs of said maintenance and upkeep to the residents
over a number of years. (AMENDED 11/26/85)
Section 15-202 Flexibility in Administration Authorized.
(a) The requirements set forth in this article concerning the amount, size, location and
nature of recreational facilities and open space to be provided in connection with residential
developments are established by the Board as standards that presumptively will result in the
provision of that amount of recreational facilities and open space that is consistent with officially
adopted town plans. The Board recognizes, however, that due to the particular nature of a tract of
land, or the nature of the facilities proposed for installation, or other factors, the underlying
objectives of this article may be achieved even though the standards are not adhered to with
mathematical precision. Therefore, the permit issuing body is authorized to permit minor
deviations from these standards whenever it determines that: (i) the objectives underlying these
standards can be met without strict adherence to them; and (ii) because of peculiarities in the
developer’s tract of land or the facilities proposed it would be unreasonable to require strict
adherence to these standards.
(b) Whenever the permit issuing board authorizes some deviation from the standards set
forth in this article pursuant to subsection (a), the official record of action taken on the development
application shall contain a statement of the reasons for allowing the deviation.
Section 15-203 Fees in Lieu of Active Recreational Areas and Facilities or Usable Open
Space.
(a) When the permit-issuing authority determines (upon the recommendation of the
recreation director) that the recreational needs of a development required by Section 15-196 to
construct active recreational areas and facilities could also be adequately met by facilities
constructed on town property that is located close enough to such development to reasonably serve
its residents, the town may authorize the developer to pay a fee to the town’s open space and
recreational facilities fund in lieu of providing on-site facilities. For purposes of this subsection,
“town property” means property that is owned by the town or that the town has made plans to
acquire within a reasonable time. (AMENDED 2/20/90)
Art. XIII RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND OPEN SPACE
Page #10
(b) With respect to residential developments that are exempt from the requirement of
providing on-site active recreational areas and facilities under Subsection 15-196(d) or exempt from
the requirement of providing usable open space under Subsection 15-198(j) and that choose not to
provide such facilities or open space, the town shall accept and the developer shall pay a fee to the
town’s open space and recreational facilities fund if the permit-issuing authority determines that the
town has acquired or has made plans to acquire within a reasonable time the necessary land to
provide usable open space or a site for recreational facilities that can be expected to benefit or serve
such developments.
(c) The minimum amount of the fee paid under this section in lieu of active recreational
areas and facilities shall be determined by multiplying the amount of recreation points that would
otherwise be required of the development under Section 15-196 by the dollar value per point
established in the town’s miscellaneous fees and charges schedule. However, nothing herein shall
prevent a developer from paying a fee that exceeds the minimum fee established pursuant to this
subsection, and the town’s willingness to allow a payment of fees in lieu of on-site provisions of
facilities or open space under subsection (a) may depend upon the developer’s agreement to pay
fees in excess of the minimum.
(d) The minimum amount of the fee paid under this section in lieu of usable open space
shall be determined by multiplying the square footage of open space that would otherwise be
required of the development under Subsection 15-198(c) by the dollar value per square foot
established in the town’s miscellaneous fees and charges schedule.
(e) With respect to any development that is authorized or required by this section to pay
a fee in lieu of providing recreational facilities or usable open space, no use may be commenced, lot
sold, or building occupied unless the fee has been paid. If a development is intended to be sold or
occupied on a phase-by-phase basis, payment of the fee relating to each phase must first be made.
Section 15-204 Downtown Livability Area and Urban Amenities Provisions
(a) The Board concludes that when land is developed substantially for residential
purposes in the downtown, defined for purposes of this section as those areas zoned B-1(G), B-
1(c), B-2, or CT, the public health, safety, and welfare are best served when portions of such
properties are developed as “downtown livability areas” and improved with “urban amenities” as
those terms are used in this section. The development of such properties in this way may serve
some or all of the following important objectives, to the benefit of downtown business owners,
shoppers, workers, pedestrians, and residents, as well as the general public:
(1) provide relief from the high-density built environment (for example by mitigating
urban temperature, pollution, glare);
(2) enhance the pedestrian experience;
(3) promote walking and biking in the downtown area;
(4) decrease stormwater runoff;
Art. XIII RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND OPEN SPACE
Page #11
(5) provide food or habitat for wildlife;
(6) provide opportunities for artistic expression or the enjoyment of the same;
(7) provide opportunities for social gathering.
(b) For purposes of this section, “downtown livability area” (DLA) refers to an outdoor
area that (i) is not devoted to use as a roadway, parking area, required sidewalk, or required shade
tree islands in parking lots; (ii) is legally and practically accessible to all of the residents,
occupants, tenants, and owners of the property to which the DLA appertains (except that
balconies and roof areas developed as DLA with or without urban amenities need not be so
accessible); (iii) is not encumbered with any substantial structure other than an urban amenity;
and (iv) with or without the improvement of an urban amenity, achieves one or more of the
objectives set forth in subsection (a) of this section. An “outdoor area” means an area that is
either not under roof or, if under roof, is permanently open to the outdoors on at least 50 percent
of the circumference of such area. A “green roof” means a roof of a building or structure (or
portion thereof) that is covered with vegetation and soil, or a growing medium, planted over a
waterproofing membrane.
(c) For purposes of this section, “urban amenities” refers to improvements that (i) are
located or constructed within downtown livability areas, and (ii) are designed, installed, and
maintained to achieve one or more of the objectives set forth in subsection (a) of this section,
together with any improvements necessary to support the function or safety of or provide access
to such amenities. Urban amenities include but shall not be limited to the following: water
features (reflecting pools, fountains); special visual or environmental exterior features
incorporated into building architecture, public art; historic markers, features, or places; shadeproducing
street trees; outdoor furniture for seating, playing games, or picnicking; arbors,
trellises, or pergolas with live plants; balcony plantings; birdfeeders, birdhouses, and birdbaths;
widened sidewalks; covered bike racks; garden perimeter walls low and wide enough to
accommodate sitting and lounging; green roofs.
(d) For downtown developments in which 25 percent or more of the gross floor area
is for residential use only, the downtown livability area and urban amenities requirements are as
follows:
(1) The site shall be developed so that an area (measured in square feet) equal to at
least 12 percent of the total land area remains permanently as downtown livability
area, provided that:
a. DLA can be reduced to 10 percent of the land area if the DLA is
substantially landscaped with grass, vegetative ground cover, plants,
shrubs, bushes, or other vegetative landscaping and that is shaded to the
extent of at least 35 percent of such area at noon on June 21st by building,
awnings, pergolas, other structures, or shade trees, constructed or planted
within or adjacent to such DLA.
Art. XIII RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND OPEN SPACE
Page #12
For purposes of this subsection a “shade tree” means a tree whose height at
maturity can be expected to exceed 20 feet, and of a species, according to
its shape, size, and leaf size, that can be expected to provide shade during
the growing season. (Please refer to LUO Appendix E, page E-13, “Trees
for Shading” for examples of appropriate tree species for provision of
shade.)
b. DLA can be reduced to 10 percent of the land area if it is legally,
practically, and visually accessible to the general public.
c. The DLA can be reduced to 7 percent of the land area if it meets both the
criteria set forth in (d)(1)b and (d)(1)c.
(2) The dollar value of the urban amenities to be installed within the downtown
livability area shall equal an amount to 7 percent of the assessed value of the land
that constitutes the development site, determined as of the date the development
permit is approved.
When a development that is subject to this requirement contains a residential
component, and the developer either provides recreation facilities or makes a
payment in lieu to satisfy the requirements of this article, then such developer
shall receive a credit toward the fulfillment of such developer’s urban amenities
obligation, if the amenities are publicly accessible, in the amount of 50 percent of
the dollar value of the recreational facilities installed (determined by multiplying
the recreational points associated with the facilities installed by the dollar value of
such points as set forth in the town’s miscellaneous fees and charges schedule) or
the dollars paid in lieu of installing facilities.
(e) Reserved.
(f) The dollar value of the urban amenities shall be determined in the permit review
process. The developer shall submit sufficiently detailed information as to the particular
amenities to be installed and the cost of such amenities to allow the permit issuing authority to
determine whether the requirements of this section will be satisfied.
(g) The requirements of this section shall not apply to permits issued for single-family
or two-family dwellings or to those developments described in Section 15-197 of this article.
(h) The requirements of this section shall not apply to previously developed lots if the
developer demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the permit issuing authority that the cost
of the work proposed under the new permit is less than 50 percent of the assessed value of the
improvements already on the lot when the applications for the new permit is filed.
(i) For the purposes of this section, the term “development site” shall mean the lot
where the development occurs, except that if less than 50 percent of such lot is proposed to be
Art. XIII RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND OPEN SPACE
Page #13
the subject of improvements authorized under the requested permit (including the construction of
buildings, parking, landscaping, and/or significant improvements), then the term “development
site” shall refer just to the portion of such lot where the improvements authorized by the permit
are to be constructed.
Section 15-205_Fees in Lieu of Downtown Livability Area and Urban Amenities
(a) When the permit-issuing authority determines that it is physically impossible or
impracticable for a development to satisfy the downtown livability area and urban amenities
requirements of Section 15-204, then the permit-issuing authority may authorize the developer to
pay a fee to the town’s downtown livability area and urban amenities fund in lieu of complying
with such requirements. The permit authority may allow such a payment in lieu only if it
concludes that the objectives set forth in Subsection 15-204(a) could also be adequately met by
having the town construct urban amenities on town property that is located within the downtown
area. For purposes of this subsection, “town property” means property that is owned by the town
or that the town has made plans to acquire within a reasonable time.
(b) The amount of the fee paid under this section in lieu of downtown livability area
shall be equal to the product of the number of normally required square footage of DLA that is
not being provided times the per square foot assessed value of the lot on which such development
is proposed. The amount of the fee paid under this section in lieu of urban amenities shall be
determined as follows: the dollar amount of urban amenities that would otherwise be required to
be constructed on the development site in accordance with the provisions of Section 15-204 shall
be calculated, and from this amount shall be subtracted the dollar amount of urban amenities (if
any) that are placed on the development site within any downtown livability areas that are
provided.
(c) With respect to any development that is authorized to pay a fee in lieu of
providing downtown livability area or urban amenities, no use may be commenced, lot sold, or
building occupied unless the fee has been paid. If a development is intended to be sold or
occupied on a phase-by-phase basis, payment of the fee relating to each phase must first be made.
Section 15-206 Ownership and Maintenance of Downtown Livability Areas and Urban
Amenities
(a) Downtown livability areas and urban amenities provided in accordance with
Section 15-204 shall remain under the ownership and control of the developer (or his successor)
or a property owners’ association or similar organization that satisfies the criteria established in
Section 15-201. Such downtown livability areas and urban amenities shall be made available to
all owners, residents, occupants, and tenants of the development under reasonable rules and
regulations established to encourage and govern the use of such downtown livability areas and
urban amenities by the users without payment of separate optional fees or charges other than
membership fees in a property owners’ association.

STREETS AND SIDEWALKS
Section 15-210 Street Classification.
(a) In all new subdivisions, streets that are dedicated to public use shall be classified as
provided in subsection (b).
(1) The classification shall be based upon the projected volume of traffic to be
carried by the street, stated in terms of the number of trips per day;
(2) The number of dwelling units to be served by the street may be used as a
useful indicator of the number of trips but is not conclusive;
(3) Whenever a subdivision street continues an existing street that formerly
terminated outside the subdivision or it is expected that a subdivision street
will be continued beyond the subdivision at some future time, the
classification of the street will be based upon the street in its entirety, both
within and outside of the subdivision.
(b) The classification of streets shall be as follows:
(1) MINOR: A street whose sole function is to provide access to abutting
properties. It serves or is designed to serve not more than nine dwelling units
and is expected to or does handle up to seventy-five trips per day.
(2) LOCAL: A street whose sole function is to provide access to abutting
properties. It serves or is designed to serve at least ten but not more than
twenty-five dwelling units and is expected to or does handle between
seventy-five and two hundred trips per day.
(3) CUL-DE-SAC: A street that terminates in a vehicular turn-around.
(4) SUBCOLLECTOR: A street whose principal function is to provide access to
abutting properties but is also designed to be used or is used to connect
minor and local streets with collector or arterial streets. Including residences
indirectly served through connecting streets, it serves or is designed to serve
at least twenty-six but not more than one hundred dwelling units and is
expected to or does handle between two hundred and eight hundred trips per
day.
(5) COLLECTOR: A street whose principle function is to carry traffic between
minor, local, and subcollector streets and arterial streets but that may also
provide direct access to abutting properties. It serves or is designed to serve,
Art. XIV STREET AND SIDEWALKS (con’t )
Page #2
directly or indirectly, more than one hundred dwelling units and is designed
to be used or is used to carry more than eight hundred trips per day.
(6) ARTERIAL: A major street in the town’s street system that serves as an
avenue for the circulation of traffic into, out, or around the town and carries
high volumes of traffic. The following streets are arterial streets:
Culbreth Road Main Street
Dairyland Road Merritt Mill Road
Damascus Church Road N.C. Hwy 54
Estes Drive Old Greensboro Road
Eubanks Road Old Hwy 86
Greensboro Street Old Fayetteville Rd.
Hillsborough Road Rogers Road
Homestead Road Smith Level Road
Jones Ferry Road Weaver Street
(AMENDED 06/04/91)
(7) MARGINAL ACCESS STREET: A street that is parallel to and adjacent to an
arterial street and that is designed to provide access to abutting properties so
that these properties are somewhat sheltered from the effects of the through
traffic on the arterial street and so that the flow of traffic on the arterial street
is not impeded by direct driveway access from a large number of abutting
properties.
(8) LOOP STREET. A street having two points of intersection with the same
street. (AMENDED 06/21/94)
(9) ALLEY. A one-way service road providing a secondary means of public
access to abutting property and not intended for general traffic circulation
with a maximum length of 550 feet. (AMENDED 09/27/94)
Section 15-211 Access to Public Streets in General.
Every lot shall have access to it that is sufficient to afford a reasonable means of ingress and
egress for emergency vehicles as well as for all those likely to need or desire access to the property
in its intended use. (AMENDED 5/10/83; 4/24/84)
Section 15-212 Access to Arterial Streets.
Whenever a major subdivision that involves the creation of one or more new streets borders
on or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, no direct driveway access may be provided
from the lots within this subdivision onto this street.
Art. XIV STREET AND SIDEWALKS (con’t )
Page #3
Section 15-213 Entrances to Streets.
(a) All driveway entrances and other openings onto streets within the town’s planning
jurisdiction shall be constructed so that:
(1) Vehicles can enter and exit from the lot in question without posing any
substantial danger to themselves, pedestrians, or vehicles traveling on
abutting streets; and
(2) Interference with the free and convenient flow of traffic in abutting or
surrounding streets is minimized.
(3) In considering (1) and (2) above, the following factors shall be considered:
(AMENDED 2/4/86)
a. The nature of the abutting street, its capacity, use, speed and flow,
and reasonably anticipated changes to the street; and
b. The nature of the proposed use of the land, the traffic generated, the
existence and number of drive-in window(s), the internal system for
moving vehicles while on the lot; and
c. The nature of the exit and entrance, the site distance, the distance
from intersections, the alignment with other drives and streets,
turning controls or limitations.
d. As a minimum, no drive should be located within 250 feet of an
intersection of an existing or planned arterial or collector road.
(b) As provided in G.S. 136-93, no person may construct any driveway entrance or
other opening onto a state-maintained street except in accordance with a permit issued by the North
Carolina Department of Transportation. Issuance of this permit is prima facie evidence of
compliance with the standard set forth in subsection (a).
(c) If driveway entrances and other openings onto town-maintained streets are
constructed in accordance with the specifications set forth in Appendix B to this chapter, this shall
be deemed prima facie evidence of compliance with the standard set forth in subsection (a).
(d) For purposes of this section, the term “prima facie evidence” means that the
permit-issuing authority may (but is not required to) conclude from this evidence alone that the
proposed development complies with subsection (a).
Section 15-214 Coordination with Surrounding Streets.
(a) The street system of a subdivision shall be coordinated with existing, proposed and
anticipated streets outside the subdivision or outside the portion of a single tract that is being
divided into lots (hereinafter, “surrounding streets”) as provided in this section.
Art. XIV STREET AND SIDEWALKS (con’t )
Page #4
(b) Collector streets shall intersect with surrounding collector or arterial streets at safe
and convenient locations.
(c) Subject to subsection 15-217(a), subcollector, local, and minor residential streets
shall connect with all surrounding streets to permit safe, convenient movement of traffic between
residential neighborhoods and to facilitate access to neighborhoods by emergency and other service
vehicles. The connections shall be created in such a way that they do not encourage the use
of such streets by substantial through traffic. (AMENDED 09/16/97; 05/06/03)
(d) Whenever connections to anticipated or proposed surrounding streets are required
by this section, the street right-of-way shall be extended and the street developed to the property
line of the subdivided property (or to the edge of the remaining undeveloped portion of a single
tract) at the point where the connection to the anticipated or proposed street is expected. In
addition, the permit-issuing authority may require temporary turnarounds to be constructed at the
end of such streets pending their extension when such turnarounds appear necessary to facilitate the
flow of traffic or accommodate emergency vehicles. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this
subsection, no temporary dead-end street in excess of 1,000 feet may be created unless no other
practicable alternative is available.
Section 15-215 Relationship of Streets to Topography.
(a) Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography. In particular, streets shall be
designed to facilitate the drainage and stormwater runoff objectives set forth in Article XVI, and
subject to the design requirements relating to maximum grades set forth in subsection (b), street
grades shall conform as closely as practicable to the original topography.
(b) As indicated in Section 15-216, the maximum grade at any point on a street
constructed without curb and gutter shall be 8%. On streets constructed with curb and gutter the
grade shall not exceed 8% unless no other practicable alternative is available. However, in no case
may streets be constructed with grades that, in the professional opinion of the public works director,
create a substantial danger to the public safety.
Section 15-216 Street Width, Sidewalk, and Drainage Requirements in Subdivisions
(AMENDED 08/27/96, 10/23/2018)
(a) Minor and local streets where the grade does not exceed 8% may be constructed
without curb and gutter in accordance with the standards set forth in subsection (b). All other
streets shall be constructed in accordance with the standards set forth in subsection (c).
(AMENDED 05/12/98)
(b) Subject to subsections (d), (e), and (f), streets constructed without curb and gutter
shall conform to the following standards as well as the specifications referenced in Section 15-
219. To the extent practicable, the side slope of the drainage swale shall not exceed 4:1 on the
street side and on the back side shall not exceed 3:1. When necessary, the minimum right-of-way
Art. XIV STREET AND SIDEWALKS (con’t )

of this subsection and the specifications referenced in Section 15-219. Only standard 900
curb may be constructed, except that roll-type curb may be authorized by the permit issuing authority.
Street pavement width shall be measured from curb face to curb face where 900 curb is
used, and from the back of one curb to the back of the opposite curb where roll-type curb is used.

(d) The Board may allow a deviation from the standards set forth in subsections (b) and
(c) to allow the construction of a street divided by a landscaped median with one-way traffic
proceeding in opposite directions on either side of the median. The Board may allow such a street
if it finds that, if completed as proposed, such a street will (i) adequately and safely serve the
functions streets are designed to serve, and (ii) will not impose on the town any undue or
unreasonable costs or burdens relating to repair and maintenance.
(d1) The B o ar d may, for any development approved w i t h a c on di t i o na l u s e
p e r m it on property zoned B - 4 - C U o r B-4-CZ, authorize a deviation from the standards set
forth in subsection (b) and Appendix C relative to streets and sidewalks if the Board concludes that
(i) the proposed streets and sidewalks would serve the functions they are designed to serve
as well as or better than streets and sidewalks constructed in conformity with subsection
(b) and Appendix C; and (ii) such streets and sidewalks will not impose on the town any undue
or unreasonable costs or burdens relating to repairs and maintenance.
(e) The Board may allow a deviation from the right-of-way minimums set forth in
subsections (b) and (c) if it finds that (i) the deviation is needed because in order for a development
to be served by a public street the street must be constructed within an area that is not of sufficient
Art. XIV STREET AND SIDEWALKS (con’t )
Page #6
width to comply with the right-of-way criteria set forth above, (ii) a street that meets the pavement
width criteria and substantially complies with the other criteria set forth above can be constructed
within the right-of-way that can be made available; and (iii) that the applicant show that he has
made a reasonable effort and attempted to purchase the necessary right-of-way.
(f) The Board may allow a deviation from the standard right-of-way minimums set
forth in subsections (b) and (c) if it finds that the developer has obtained an agreement from the
utility companies whose lines will need to be located within a street right-of-way to install such
lines in a single trench or in some other fashion that allows the street right-of-way to serve all of its
intended purposes with a lesser width than that specified in subsections (b) and (c).
(g) The sidewalks required by this section shall be at least five feet wide and constructed
with concrete according to the specification set forth in Appendix C, except that the
permit issuing authority may permit the installation of walkways constructed with mortarless laid
brick pavement according to specifications set forth in Appendix C when it concludes that:
(AMENDED 12/08/98)
(1) Such walkways shall serve the residents of the development as adequately
as concrete sidewalks; and
(2) Such walkways shall be more environmentally desirable or more in keeping
with the overall design of the development.
(h) Whenever the permit issuing authority finds that a means of pedestrian access is
necessary from the subdivision to schools, parks, playgrounds, or other roads or facilities and that
such access is not conveniently provided by sidewalks adjacent to the streets, the developer may
be required to reserve an unobstructed easement of at least ten feet in width to provide such access.
(i) In subdivision developments that abut a public street, sidewalks shall be constructed
adjacent to such street if a sidewalk in that location is required by the officially adopted
town sidewalk master plan. Whenever possible, such sidewalk shall be constructed within the
public right-of-way.
(j) The sidewalks required by this section along streets with curb and gutter shall be
constructed with a planting strip at least three feet in width, unless the permit-issuing authority allows
the strip to be omitted or constructed at a lesser width upon a finding that such deviation
from the presumptive standard is warranted to avoid environmental damage or to promote public
safety. For purposes of this subsection, a planting strip shall mean a strip of land located between
the back of the curb and the walkway. Such planting strips shall be planted with grass or otherwise
landscaped. (AMENDED 11/19/96; 12/08/98)

(a) When any tract of land is developed under circumstances requiring the issuance of a special
or conditional use permit, the street and road design requirements for streets other than collector
streets that would otherwise be determined in accordance with the provisions of Sections
15-216 and 15-221 may be modified, by approval of the permit-issuing authority, to alternative
street width and construction specifications, sidewalk and drainage requirements, as
illustrated in Appendix C, for developments that
1) involve the extension of, or connection to, existing Town streets, the construction specifications
of which do not meet the minimum standards established in Section 15-216 in association
with Section 15-210 Street Classification;
2) meet the following low-impact development criteria:
a) preserves open space and minimizes land disturbance;
b) protects natural systems and preserves natural processes (including, but not limited to,
drainage ways, vegetation, soils, and other sensitive areas);
c) maximizes the incorporation of natural site elements (including, but not limited to,
wetlands, stream corridors, and mature forests), and;
d) decentralizes and micromanages stormwater at its source to the maximum extent
practicable.
3) include a minimum of 15 percent affordable housing units (as defined in Section 15-

a. The development contains a parallel system that is integrally designed and provides
pedestrian access to the interior of the site;
b. Any new public street passing through the development and the bulk of the facilities
and activities are to occur on one side of the road;
c. Any new public street connects to an existing street that does not meet publics
street standards and where the site conditions indicate that the full upgrade of the
street to the town standards would not be practicable; and
d. The developer is participating in off-site construction of, or improvements to public
sidewalks that will connect the new development with the town’s sidewalk
system.
Section 15-217 General Layout of Streets.
(a) To the extent practicable, all streets shall be interconnected. Cul-de-sacs shall not
be used unless the topography of the land does not allow a design that would make an
interconnecting street practicable. (AMENDED 09/16/97; 09/28/99)
(b) All permanent dead-end streets [as opposed to temporary dead-end streets, see
subsection 15-214(d)] shall be developed as cul-de-sacs in accordance with the standards set forth
in subsection (c), unless construction of such cul-de-sacs is not reasonably possible given such
factors as steep slopes or right-of-way limitations. Under such circumstances, the town may
approve alternative designs that will provide a safe and convenient means for vehicular traffic to
turn around (alternatives are suggested in Appendix C, Standard Drawing No. 19). Except where
no other practicable alternative is available, such streets may not extend more than 550 feet
(measured to the center of the turn-around). (AMENDED 09/27/94, 09/16/97)
(c) The right-of-way of a cul-de-sac shall have a radius of 60 feet if constructed without
curb and gutter or a radius of 52 feet if constructed with curb and gutter. The radius of the paved
portion of the turn-around for streets constructed without curb and gutter shall be 42’ (measured to
the outer edge of pavement) and for streets constructed with curb and gutter shall be 44.5’
(measured to the back of the outer curb). If a developer chooses to provide an unpaved center
island in the cul-de-sac, the island shall be landscaped and shall not be dedicated to the public; it
shall remain under the ownership and control of the developer (or his successor) or a homeowners
association or similar organization that satisfies the criteria established in Section 15-201. Cul-desacs
containing center islands shall have a minimum pavement width of 18 feet if constructed
without curb and gutter or 20 feet if constructed with curb and gutter (measured from inner edge of
pavement to face of curb). Mountable 45° curbing shall be installed around the island in
accordance with Town of Carrboro design specifications. Minimum design and construction
specifications for cul-de-sacs are set forth in Appendix C.
Asymmetrical cul-de-sacs may be allowed with the approval of the public works director,
town engineer, fire chief, and the applicable permit issuing authorities. (AMENDED 2/20/90;

Art. XIV STREET AND SIDEWALKS (con’t )
Page #9
(d) Half streets (i.e., streets of less than the full required right-of-way and payment
width) shall not be permitted except where such streets, when combined with a similar street
(developed previously or simultaneously) on property adjacent to the subdivision, creates or
comprises a street that meets the right-of-way and pavement requirements of this chapter.
(AMENDED 09/16/97)
(e) Streets shall be laid out so that residential blocks do not exceed 1,000 feet, unless no
other practicable alternative is available. (AMENDED 09/16/97)
(f) Alleys shall not intersect with any arterials and shall meet the “Entrances to Streets”
standards of Section 15-213. Alley radii at street intersections shall not be less than 15 feet. Alleys
may run adjacent to lot line boundaries only and not parallel and adjacent to street right-of-way or
front property boundaries. In determining conformance with Section 15-184(a), Setback
Requirements, the right-of-way lines associated with alleys shall be regarded as lot boundary lines
and not street right-of-way lines. (AMENDED 09/27/94; 09/16/97)
(g) To the extent practicable, portions of subcollector and collector streets that consist
of stretches of 800 feet or more uninterrupted by intersections suitable for stop signs shall contain
design features intended to discourage speeding and cut-through traffic, including but not limited
to one or more of the following:
(1) Curves with radius of 800 feet or less; or
(2) Design features described in the town’s Residential Traffic Management
Plan.
(AMENDED 09/16/97)
Section 15-218 Street Intersections.
(a) Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no two streets may
intersect at less than 60o. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point, unless the
public works director certifies to the permit issuing authority that such an intersection can be
constructed with no extraordinary danger to public safety.
(b) Whenever possible, proposed intersections along one side of a street shall coincide
with existing or proposed intersections on the opposite side of such street. In any event, where a
center line offset (jog) occurs at an intersection, the distance between centerlines of the intersecting
streets shall be not less than 150 feet except as provided in subsection (d). (AMENDED 4/26/88)
(c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) and (e): (AMENDED 4/26/88;
REWRITTEN 1/26/10)
(1) No two streets may intersect with any other street on the same side at a
distance of less than 400 feet measured from centerline to centerline of the
intersecting street.
Art. XIV STREET AND SIDEWALKS (con’t )
Page #10
(2) When the intersected street is an arterial, the distance between intersecting
streets shall be at least 1,000 feet.
(d) The provisions of this section shall not operate to prohibit any property from having
direct access onto an adjacent public street, and when a literal application of the provisions of this
section would otherwise prohibit all such access, the permit-issuing authority may allow the
minimum deviation from the requirements of this section that is necessary to provide reasonable
access. (AMENDED 4/26/88)
(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, two streets may intersect with another street on the
same side at a distance of less than 400 feet, measured from centerline to centerline of the
intersecting streets, if the street with which the two streets intersect is connected to a street within
a village mixed use development and a development itself is adjacent to a village mixed use
development. However, in no event, may the two streets intersect at a distance of less than 125
feet. (AMENDED 1/26/10).
Section 15-219 Construction Standards and Specifications.
Construction and design standards and specifications for streets, sidewalks, and curbs and
gutters are contained in Appendix C, and all such facilities shall be completed in accordance with
these standards.
Section 15-220 Public Streets and Private Roads in Subdivisions.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, all lots created after the effective date
of this section shall abut a public street at least to the extent necessary to comply with the access
requirement set forth in Section 15-211. For purposes of this subsection, the term “public street”
includes a pre-existing public street as well as a street created by the subdivider that meets the
public street standards of this chapter and is dedicated for public use. Unless the recorded plat of a
subdivision clearly shows a street to be private, the recording of such a plat shall constitute an offer
of dedication of such street. (AMENDED 2/14/84)
(b) Architecturally integrated residential subdivisions containing either twenty-five or
more units, or consisting of four or more multi-family townhomes, may be developed with private
roads that do not meet the public street and sidewalk standards of this chapter as long as:
(AMENDED 11/26/85; 6/25/02)
(1) The proposed development will have direct access onto a public street or, if
the tract has access to a public street only via a private road, such private
road is improved to public street standards;
(2) No road intended to be private is planned to be extended to serve property
outside that development; and
Art. XIV STREET AND SIDEWALKS (con’t )
Page #11
(3) The standards applicable to unsubdivided developments set forth in Section
15-221 and 15-222 are complied with.
(c) Subdivisions containing any number of lots may be developed with private roads
that do meet the public street and sidewalk standards of this chapter but that are not intended for
dedication to the public so long as:
(1) The proposed development will have direct access onto a public street or, if
the tract has access to a public street only via a private road, such private
road is improved to public street standards;
(2) No road intended to be private is planned or expected to be extended to
serve property outside the development; and
(3) The subdivider demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the Board that
the private roads will be properly maintained.
(d) A subdivision in which the access requirement of Section 15-211 is satisfied by a
private road that meets neither the public street standards nor the standards set forth in Section
15-221 may be developed so long as, since the effective date of this chapter, not more than three
lots have been created out of that same tract.
(1) The intent of this subsection is primarily to allow the creation of not more
than three lots developed for single-family residential purposes. Therefore,
the permit-issuing authority may not approve any subdivision served by a
private road authorized under this subsection in which one or more of the
lots thereby created is intended for (i) two-family or multi-family residential
user or (ii) any non- residential use that would tend to generate more traffic
than that customarily generated by three single-family residences.
(2) To ensure that the intent of this subsection is not subverted, the
permit-issuing authority may, among other possible options, require that the
approved plans show the types and locations of buildings on each lot or that
the lots in a residential subdivision served by a private road authorized under
this subsection be smaller than the permissible size lots on which two-family
or multi- family developments could be located or that restrictive covenants
limiting the use of the subdivided property in accordance with this
subsection be recorded before final plat approval.
(e) No final plat that shows lots served by private roads may be recorded unless the
final plat contains the following notations:
(1) “Further subdivision of any lot shown on this plat as served by a private road
may be prohibited by the Carrboro Land Use Ordinance.”
Art. XIV STREET AND SIDEWALKS (con’t )
Page #12
(2) “The policy of the Town of Carrboro is that, if the town improves streets (i)
that were never constructed to the standards required in the Carrboro Land
Use Ordinance for dedicated streets, and (ii) on which 75% of the dwelling
units were constructed after July 1, 1979, 100% of the costs of such
improvements shall be assessed to abutting landowners.”
(f) The recorded plat of any subdivision that includes a private road shall clearly state
that such road is a private road. Further, the initial purchaser of a newly created lot served by a
private road shall be furnished by the seller with a disclosure statement outlining the maintenance
responsibilities for the road, in accordance with the requirements set forth in G.S. 136-102.6. The
intention of this subsection is to afford the same protection to purchasers of lots on private roads
within the town as is provided to purchasers of lots outside the town by G.S. 136-102.6.
(g) For purposes of this section, a private road meets the public street and sidewalk
standards of this chapter if it is designed and constructed and sufficient setbacks are provided so
that, if intended for dedication, it could be accepted as a public street in conformity with the
requirements of this chapter. (AMENDED 11/26/85)
(h) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, the town may prohibit the
creation of a private road if the creation of such a road would avoid the public street interconnection
requirements set forth in Sections 15-214 and 15-217(a). (AMENDED 6/25/02)
Section 15-220.1 Design Standards for Village Mixed Use Developments (AMENDED
5/28/02)
(a) Village mixed use developments may be designed in accordance with the North
Carolina Department of Transportation Traditional Neighborhood Development
(TND) Guidelines, August 2000. Where specific NCDOT TND design guidelines
have been established, these may supercede any related street design standards
contained in this Ordinance, as well as standards and guidelines for utilities,
landscaping and similar considerations. In the absence of TND specific design
guidelines, the existing standards, criteria, guidelines or policies shall be applied.
(b) For purposes of implementing the NCDOT TND Guidelines, a village mixed use
development shall be deemed to be a “classic” TND.
Section 15-221 Road and Sidewalk Requirements in Unsubdivided Developments.
(a) Within unsubdivided developments, all private roads and access ways shall be
designed and constructed to facilitate the safe and convenient movement of motor vehicle and
pedestrian traffic. Width of roads, use of curb and gutter, and paving specifications shall be
determined by the provisions of this chapter dealing with parking (Article XVIII) and drainage
(Article XVI). To the extent not otherwise covered in the foregoing articles, and to the extent that
the requirements set forth in this article for subdivision streets may be relevant to the roads in
Art. XIV STREET AND SIDEWALKS (con’t )
Page #13
unsubdivided developments, the requirements of this article may be applied to satisfy the standards
set forth in the first sentence of this subsection.
(b) Whenever (i) a lot is proposed to be developed residentially for more than four
dwelling units or non-residentially in such a fashion as to generate more than 40 vehicle trips per
day, and (ii) if the lot were to be subdivided, a street would be required running through the lot to
provide a connection between existing or planned adjacent streets in accordance with the provisions
of Sections 15-214 and 15-217(a), then the developer shall be required to construct and dedicate the
same street that would have been required had the property been subdivided. On Town-owned
properties, the Board of Aldermen may eliminate or reduce the requirements of this section for
reservation and/or connection of right-of-way.
(AMENDED 6/25/02; 06/06/17)
(c) In all unsubdivided residential developments, sidewalks shall be provided linking
dwelling units with other dwelling units, the public street, and on-site activity centers such as
parking areas, laundry facilities, and recreational areas and facilities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, sidewalks shall not be required where pedestrians have access to a road that serves not
more than nine dwelling units. (AMENDED 4/24/84)
(d) Whenever the permit issuing authority finds that a means of pedestrian access is
necessary from an unsubdivided development to schools, parks, playgrounds, or other roads or
facilities and that such access is not conveniently provided by sidewalks adjacent to the roads, the
developer may be required to reserve an unobstructed easement of at least ten feet to provide such
access.
(e) In unsubdivided nonresidential developments that abut a public street, sidewalks
shall be constructed adjacent to such street if a sidewalk in that location is required by the officially
adopted town sidewalk master plan. Whenever possible, such sidewalk shall be constructed within
the public right-of-way.
(f) The sidewalks required by this section shall be at least five feet wide, except that,
where practicable, the sidewalks in the B-l(c), B-l(g), B-2, and C-T zoning districts shall be at least
ten feet wide. Sidewalks are to be constructed according to the specifications set forth in Appendix
C, except that the permit issuing authority may permit the installation of walkways constructed with
other suitable materials when it concludes that: (AMENDED 12/08/98; 4/8/03)
(1) Such walkways would serve the residents of the development as adequately
as concrete sidewalks; and
(2) Such walkways could be more environmentally desirable or more in keeping
with the overall design of the development.

issuing authority. Proposed streets that are obviously in alignment with existing streets shall be
given the same name. Newly created streets shall be given names that neither duplicate nor are
phonetically similar to existing streets within the town’s planning jurisdiction, regardless of the use
of different suffixes [such as those set forth in subsection (b)].
(b) Street names shall include a suffix such as the following:
(1) Circle: A short street that returns to itself.
(2) Court or Place: A cul-de-sac or dead-end street.
(3) Loop: A street that begins at the intersection with one street and circles back
to end at another intersection with the same street.
(4) Street: All public streets not designated by another suffix.
(c) Building numbers shall be assigned by the town as provided in Section 7-32 of the
Town Code.
Section 15-224 Bridges.

MISCELLANEOUS UTILITIES (REWRITTEN 4/20/10)
PART 1. WATER AND WASTEWATER
1BUSection 15-236 Utility Ownership and Easement Rights.
In any case in which a developer installs or causes the installation of water, sewer,
electric power, telephone, or cable television facilities and intends that such facilities shall be
owned, operated or maintained by a public utility or any entity other than the developer, the
developer shall transfer to such utility or entity the necessary ownership or easement rights to
enable the utility or entity to operate and maintain such facilities.
USection 15-237 Lots Served by OWASA-Owned Water and Sewer Lines.
(a) Subject to subsection (d), whenever it is legally possible and practicable in terms
of topography to connect a lot with a water or sewer line owned by the Orange Water and Sewer
Authority (OWASA) by running a connecting line not more than the distance specified in
subdivision (1) below from the lot to the point of connection, then no use requiring water or
sewage disposal service may be made of such lot unless connection is made to the OWASA line.
(AMENDED 2/24/87)
(1) If the tract in question is proposed to be developed for residential
purposes, then the distance within which connection must be made shall
be 200 feet plus 10 feet for each unit in excess of 4 units on the
development tract. If the tract in question is proposed to be developed for
nonresidential purposes, then the distance within which connection must
be made shall be determined by transposing the projected demand of the
proposed non-residential use into the demand created by an equivalent
number of average residential units and using the foregoing formula.
(2) In determining units in a development, tracts proposed to be subdivided
and not using architecturally integrated subdivisions shall have their total
unit potential determined by calculating the maximum number of units
allowable for each proposed lot. The total number of units proposed on
other developments shall be shown on the proposed site plan.
(b) Connection to the OWASA line is not legally possible if, in order to make
connection with the OWASA line by a connecting line that does not exceed a distance
Art. XV Utilities (cont.)
Page #2
determined in accordance with subsection (a), it is necessary to run the connecting line over
property not owned by the owner of the property to be served by the connection, and after
diligent effort, the easement necessary to run the connecting line cannot reasonably be obtained.
(c) For purposes of this article, a lot is “served” by the OWASA system if the lot is
connected to that system or if connection is required by this section.
(d) This section shall not operate either to require or prevent the extension of water or
sewer lines to lots within the WR, C, B-5, or WM-3 zoning districts. (AMENDED 05/15/90)
USection 15-238 Sewage Disposal Facilities Required.
(a) Every principal use and every lot within a subdivision shall be served by a sewage
disposal system that is adequate to accommodate the reasonable needs of such use or subdivision
lot, and that complies with all applicable health regulations.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, no sewage treatment system
other than individual on site septic systems or individual on site alternative disposal systems
approved by the Orange County Health Department or the appropriate state or federal agency
and serving a single unit shall be allowed within the WR, C, B-5, and WM-3 zoning districts,
except that any lots in the Rangewood Subdivision that were benefited by OWASA’s previous
water and sewer extension project and which appear on OWASA’s final assessment role for that
project may be connected to OWASA’s water and/or sewer lines as long as all assessments, fees,
and charges have been paid or are up-to-date. (AMENDED 09/01/92)
(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, no sewage collection system
shall be allowed within the WR, C, B-5, and WM-3 zoning districts except to remedy a public
health emergency not otherwise correctable such as (but not limited to) a failing septic system or
failing package treatment plant as determined by the Orange County Health Department or
appropriate state or federal agency. (AMENDED 5/3/88; 6/23/88; 5/15/90)
USection 15-239 Determining Compliance With Section 15-238.
(a) Primary responsibility for determining whether a proposed development will
comply with the standard set forth in Section 15-238 often lies with an agency other than the
town, and the developer must comply with the detailed standards and specifications of such other
agency. The relevant agencies are listed in subsection (b). Whenever any such agency requires
detailed construction or design drawings before giving its official approval to the proposed
sewage disposal system, the authority issuing a permit under this chapter may rely upon a
preliminary review by such agency of the basic design elements of the proposed sewage disposal
system to determine compliance with Section 15-238. However, construction of such system
may not be commenced until the detailed plans and specifications have been reviewed and any
appropriate permits issued by such agency.
(b) In the following table, the column on the left describes the type of development
and the column on the right indicates the agency that must certify to the town

No further certification is necessary
2. The use (other than a subdivision) is
located on a lot that is served by the
OWASA sewer system but service to the
use necessitates construction of an
internal collection system (as in the case
of a shopping center or apartment
complex); and
a. The internal collection system is to
be transferred to and maintained by
OWASA;
OWASA must certify to the Town that the
proposed internal collection system meets
OWASA’s specifications and will be accepted

served by the OWASA system but is to
be served by a privately operated sewage
treatment system (that has not previously
been approved) with 3000 gallons per
day or less design capacity, the effluent
from which does not discharge to surface
waters.
The Orange County Health Department
(OCHD) must certify to the Town that the
proposed system complies with all applicable
State and local health regulations. If the
proposed use is a single dwelling other than a
mobile home, the developer must obtain an
improvements permit from the OCHD. If the
proposed use is a single family mobile home,
the developer must present to the Town a
certificate of completion from the OCHD.

PART II. OUTDOOR LIGHTING
USection 15-242_ Purpose and Intent (AMENDED 4/20/10)
(a) The Board finds that outdoor lighting serves a number of beneficial purposes. For
work or recreation, it enables people to see essential detail in order that they may undertake their
activities at night. It facilitates the safety and security of persons and property, for example
through lighting on roads and pathways and the entrances to buildings. It may be used to
emphasize features of architectural or historical significance, and to light parks and gardens. It is
used for advertising or display to promote products or services, or to call attention to commercial
premises by means of area lighting or signs. However, excessive or inappropriately directed
lighting may create unwanted glare, interfere with observation of the nighttime sky, waste
valuable energy supply, and otherwise interfere with the use or enjoyment of adjoining or nearby
public or private property.
(b) It is the intent of this part to preserve, protect, and enhance the lawful nighttime use
and enjoyment of any and all property through the use of appropriate lighting practices and
systems by providing for the installation of individual fixtures and lighting systems that are
designed and installed to maintain safety, security and productivity, and to curtail the degradation
of the nighttime visual environment.
USection 15-242.1_ Definitions
Unless otherwise specifically provided, or unless clearly required by the context, the
words and phrases defined in this section shall have the meaning indicated when used in this
part.

through the refractor or diffuser lens, of a luminaire.
(2) Fixture: The assembly that houses the lamp or lamps and can include all or some of
the following parts: a housing, a mounting bracket or pole socket, a lamp holder, a
ballast, a reflector or mirror, and/or a refractor or lens.
(3) Floodlight: A form of lighting designated to direct its output more or less in a
specific direction.
(4) Footcandle: (fc) The total amount of light or illuminance cast on a surface and
equivalent to the light produced by a source of one (1) candle measured at a
distance of one (1) foot
(5) Full cut-off luminaries: A luminaire designed and installed where no light is emitted
at or above a horizontal plane running through the lowest point on the luminaire.
Art. XV Utilities (cont.)
Page #9
(6) Fully Shielded: Outdoor light fixtures with opaque top and sides, capable of only
emitting light in the lower photometric hemisphere as installed.
(7) Glare: Light emitting from a luminaire with an intensity great enough to reduce a
viewer’s ability to see, or cause annoyance and discomfort, and, in extreme cases,
causing momentary blindness.
(8) IESNA: Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, a non-profit society of
professional lighting specialists that has developed a series of recommended
standards for a variety of lighting applications.
(9) Lamp: The component of the luminaire that produces the light and commonly
referred to as the “bulb.”
(10) Light Trespass: The shining of light produced by a luminaire beyond the boundaries
of the property on which it is located.
(11) Lumen: The unit used to quantify the amount of light energy produced by a lamp at
the lamp. Lumen output of most lamps is listed on the packaging. For example, a
60-watt incandescent lamp produces 950 lumens while a 55-watt low-pressure
sodium lamp produces 8000 lumens.
(12) Luminaire: A complete lighting system that includes light source and all necessary
mechanical, electrical, and decorative parts.

to ensure the safety of persons and the security of such buildings.
USection 15-242.4 Subdivisions
(a) With respect to street lighting for subdivision streets that (i) are located on property
within the town at or about the time of final plat approval, and (ii) are intended to be dedicated to
the town, the developer shall coordinate with the electric utility company to ensure that all
Art. XV Utilities (cont.)
Page #11
facilities necessary for the installation of street lights in accordance with the town’s street
lighting policy are put in place. “As a condition of construction plan approval, all public street
lighting is to be installed by the developer prior to street acceptance by the town. The developer
shall be responsible for all installation cost and monthly billing until the public streets are
accepted onto the town’s street maintenance system.”
(b) With respect to street lighting for subdivision streets that (i) are located on property
that is not within the town at or about the time of final plat approval, and (ii) are intended to be
dedicated to the public (i.e. to the N.C. Department of Transportation initially and eventually to
the town when the subdivision is annexed), the developer shall coordinate with the electric utility
company to see that all facilities necessary for the installation of street lights in accordance with
the town’s street lighting policy are put in place. The installation of street lights that are
consistent with town policies may then be provided for either by an arrangement between the
developer or a property owners association and the electric utility company until such time as the
subdivision is annexed.
(c) With respect to street lighting for subdivision streets that are not intended to be
dedicated to the town, the developer shall provide for the installation and maintenance (either by
the developer or a successor property owners association) of a street lighting system that will
provide sufficient lighting for safety and security purposes.
USection 15-242.5__General Standards (AMENDED 10/23/2018)
(a) Unless otherwise specified, under no circumstances may the light level at a lot line
exceed .2 foot candles. A limitation of 2.0 footcandles shall generally apply to lot lines in the B-
1(c) and B-1(g) zoning districts. However, a limitation of .2 footcandles shall apply to lot lines of
properties zoned B-1(c) or B-1(g) under any of the following circumstances:
(1) Where such lot lines separate properties zoned B-1(c) or B-1(g) from
properties zoned residential;
(2) If and to the extent that properties zoned residential lie directly across a street
from the lot lines of properties zoned B-1(c) or B-1(g);
(3) Where such lot lines separate properties zoned B-1(c) or B-1(g) from
properties that are not zoned residential but that are used for residential
purposes and were so used on the effective date of this subsection;
(4) If and to the extent that properties that are not zoned residential but are used
for residential purposes and were so used on the effective date of this
subsection lie directly across a street from the lot lines of properties zoned B-
1(c) or B-1(g).

deviations from the lot line foot candle limitations described in Subsection 15-242.5(a), along
public rights-of-way, where such rights-of-way are located within a unified commercial or
mixed-use development operating under a single conditional use permit. The right-of-way must
extend through the development, not along the perimeter, and it must be dedicated to the Town.
(c) Vegetative buffers shall not be used to satisfy the standards set forth in subsection (a) of this
section
(d) Any luminaire with a lamp or lamps rated at a total of more than 1,800 lumens shall
be fully shielded and shall be located to prevent glare and light trespass beyond the property
boundary (including onto adjacent streets).
(e) The recommended maximum light output is 70,000 lumens per acre for lots developed
for commercial or multi-family purposes and 6,500 lumens per acre for lots developed for all
other purposes. This recommended maximum does not apply to those uses regulated by Sections
15-242.6, 15-242.7, and 15-242.8.
(f) Floodlights with external shielding shall be angled provided that no light is directed
above a twenty-five (25) degree angle measured from the vertical line from the center of the light
extended to the ground, and only if the luminaire does not cause glare or light to shine on
adjacent property or public or private rights-of-way. Photocells with timers that allow a
floodlight to go on at dusk and off by 11:00 p.m are encouraged.
(g) The presumptive standard for the maximum height of light poles is fifteen (15) feet in
height. The Board recognizes that due to the particularities of any given development, the inflexible
application of a height maximum for lighting fixtures may result in a development with excessive
energy consumption or light fixtures that are incompatible with the scale or style of a development.
These situations can result in a waste of money that could more desirably be used for valuable
development amenities or environmentally useful features. Therefore, the permit-issuing authority may
permit deviations from the presumptive requirements and may require shorter light fixtures or allow
taller light fixtures whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth
in subsections 15-242 (a) and (b) and that the lighting complies in all other respects with the
requirements of this part.
(1) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the permit-issuing authority may allow
or require deviations from the light fixture height maximum set forth in Subsection 15-242.5 (f) when it
finds that:
a. An existing multi-family residential development of greater than four (4)
units is seeking to improve security and safety for residents by increasing
the number of light fixtures and is also seeking to utilize light fixtures that
are similar in size and style to existing fixtures; or
Art. XV Utilities (cont.)
Page #13
b. Lighting fixtures on neighboring property are substantially lower in height
than the maximum that would be allowed and taller light fixtures would
result in a discernible negative impact in terms of excessive illumination and
glare.
(2) Whenever the permit-issuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the
presumptive lighting fixture height requirements set forth in Subsection 15-242.5(e) it shall enter on the
face of the permit the lighting fixture height requirement that it imposes and the reasons for allowing or
requiring the deviation.
(g) All wall packs shall be fully shielded.
(h) All luminaires shall be shielded or oriented in such a way as to direct light
toward the earth’s surface and away from reflective surfaces.
(i) Luminaires designed to illuminate building facades, architectural features, or
landscaping shall be oriented and shielded so that direct illumination is
focused exclusively on such building façade, architectural feature, or
landscaping and away from adjoining properties, public or private way, and
the night sky.
(j) Upward flagpole lighting is permitted for governmental flags, either publicly
or privately owned, provided that the maximum lumen output is 1,300 lumens.
It is encouraged that flags be taken down at sunset to avoid the need for
lighting.
(k) Any luminaire must be installed in such a manner that the light emitting
source is not visible from any residence not located on the same lot as the
luminaire or from any public street.
USection 15-242.6__Vehicular Canopies
(a) The light level beneath vehicular canopies (e.g. for gas stations or convenience
stores) shall not exceed 10 foot candles average maintained at the perimeter of the canopy and
measured at ground level. Acceptable ways of achieving this objective include, but are not
limited to, one or more of the following:
(1) Recessed fixtures incorporating a lens cover that is either recessed or flush
with the bottom surface (ceiling) of the vehicular canopy.
(2) Surface mounted fixtures incorporating a flat glass that provides a full cut-off
or fully shielded light distribution.
(3) Indirect lighting where light is beamed upward and then reflected down from
the underside of the vehicular canopy. Such fixtures shall be shielded such
Art. XV Utilities (cont.)
Page #14
that direct illumination is focused exclusively on the underside of the
vehicular canopy.
(4) Any other method approved by the permit issuing authority that achieves an
effect similar to the foregoing illustrations.
(b) During hours when the business is not open, the lighting level shall be reduced to
security lighting only.
USection 15-242.7 Outdoor Display Areas
(a) All display area lighting shall utilize fully shielded luminaires that are installed in a
fashion that maintains the fully shielded characteristics.
(b) Display area lighting shall be installed such that glare is not visible from residential
properties.
(c) The display area shall not be illuminated in a manner that exceeds the minimal
illuminance levels for the activity as recommended by the Illuminating Engineering Society of
North America (IESNA Rp-33, or as updated).
(d) For purposes of this section, an “outdoor display area” is an outdoor area where
nighttime sales activity regularly occurs and where accurate color perception of merchandise by
customers is required. Examples include sales areas for automobiles, boats, building supplies, or
plants.
(e) During hours when the business is not open, the lighting level shall be reduced to
security lighting only.
USection 15-242.8__Outdoor Sports Fields and Performance Areas
(a) The mounting height of outdoor sports fields and outdoor performance area lighting
fixtures shall not exceed 60 feet from finished grade unless approved by the permit-issuing
authority after receipt of substantial information justifying the need for additional height.
(b) All outdoor sports field and outdoor performance area lighting fixtures shall be
equipped with a glare control package (louvers, shields, or similar devices). The fixtures must be
aimed so that their beams are directed and fall within the primary playing or performance area.
(c) Outdoor sports field and performance area lighting systems shall not be operated
between the hours of eleven p.m. and sunrise.
USection 15-242.9 Prohibited Uses of Light
The following are prohibited:
Art. XV Utilities (cont.)
Page #15
(1) The use of laser source light or any similar high intensity light for outdoor
advertising or entertainment, when projected above the horizon;
(2) The operation of searchlights for advertising purposes;
(3) Use of mercury vapor luminaires.
USection 15-242.10__Light Measurement Techniques
a) Light measurements shall be made at finished grade (ground level), with the lightregistered
portion of the meter held parallel to the ground pointing up. The meter
shall have cosine and color correction and have an accuracy tolerance of no greater
than plus or minus five (5) percent. Measurements shall be taken with a light meter
that has been calibrated within the year. Light levels are specified, calculated and
measured in footcandles (FC). All FC values are maintained footcandles unless
otherwise specified.
b) Compliance with an approved light plan associated with a permit can be verified in the field
by confirming that the light fixtures and bulbs do not exceed those shown on the engineered
plans. When there is no approved light plan then compliance can be verified by enforcing that
the light source is blocked and/or directed in compliance with this Part or by the owner obtaining
and providing a professional engineer’s certification that verifies that the existing conditions
comply with the ordinance.

distribution, and cable television lines installed to serve the development site outside of a
previously existing public street right-of-way shall be placed underground in accordance with the
specifications and policies of the respective utility companies. (AMENDED 1/22/85)
USection 15-247 Utilities To Be Consistent With Internal and External Development.
(a) Whenever it can reasonably be anticipated that utility facilities constructed in one
development will be extended to serve other adjacent or nearby development, such utility
facilities (e.g., water or sewer lines) shall be located and constructed so that extensions can be
made conveniently and without undue burden or expense or unnecessary duplication of service.
(b) All utility facilities shall be constructed in such a manner as to minimize
interference with pedestrian or vehicular traffic and to facilitate maintenance without undue
damage to improvements or facilities located within the development.
USection 15-248 As-Built Drawings Required.
(a) Whenever a developer installs or causes to be installed any utility line in any
public right-of-way, the developer shall, as soon as practicable after installation is complete,
furnish the town with a copy of a drawing that shows the exact location of such utility lines.
Such drawings must be certified as accurate by the utility company. Compliance with this
requirement shall be a condition of the continued validity of the permit authorizing such
development.
(b) If any utility in any right-of-way is installed by a utility company, the company
shall maintain accurate as-built drawings and shall make these available to the town upon
request.
USection 15-249 Fire Hydrants.
(a) Every development, subdivided or unsubdivided, that is served by a public water
system shall include a system of fire hydrants sufficient to provide adequate fire protection for
the buildings located or intended to be located within such development. (AMENDED 4/27/82)
(b) The presumption established by this ordinance is that to satisfy the standard set
forth in subsection (a), fire hydrants must be located so that every building within the
development is not more than 500 feet from a hydrant. However, the fire chief may authorize or
require a deviation from this standard if, in his professional opinion, another arrangement more
satisfactorily complies with the standard set forth in subsection (a).
(c) The fire chief shall determine the precise location of all fire hydrants, subject to
the other provisions of this section. In general, fire hydrants shall be placed six feet behind the
curb line of publicly dedicated streets that have curb and gutter.
Art. XV Utilities (cont.)
Page #18
(d) All hydrants shall have two 2½ inch hose connections and one 4½ inch hose
connection. The 2½ inch hose connection shall be located at least 21½ inches from the ground
level. All hydrant threads shall be national standard threads.
(e) Water lines that serve hydrants shall be at least six inch lines, and unless no other
practicable alternative is available, no such lines shall be dead-end lines.
(f) When hydrants are required under this section to be located within a public street
right-of-way, the installation of such hydrants by the developer shall constitute an offer of
dedication of such hydrant to OWASA, and the town and OWASA shall thereafter deal with
such hydrant in the same manner as other hydrants located within public rights-of-way within the
town. The developer or his successor shall be responsible for ensuring that such hydrant is
properly maintained and kept in good working order, and that any costs associated with
providing water to such hydrant are paid so that the hydrant can at all times serve its intended
function. The developer or his successor may arrange with OWASA or any other entity to have
such hydrants properly maintained, but ultimate responsibility for compliance with this section
remains on the developer or his successor. (AMENDED 5/10/83)
(g) Fire hydrants required under this section shall be installed and in working
condition, subject to OWASA approval, prior to framing of any buildings in each phase.

33. Freeboard. The height added to the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) to account for the many
unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated
for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings,
and the hydrological effect of urbanization on the watershed. The Base Flood Elevation
plus the freeboard establishes the “Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation”. The
freeboard shall be two feet.
34. Functionally Dependent Facility. A facility which cannot be used for its intended
purpose unless it is located in close proximity to water, such as a docking or port facility
necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, or ship

may be designated by the town.
38. Letter of Map Change (LOMC). An official determination issued by FEMA that amends
or revises an effective Flood Insurance Rate Map or Flood Insurance Study. Letters of
Map Change include:
(a) Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): An official amendment, by letter, to an
effective National Flood Insurance Program map. A LOMA is based on
technical data showing that a property had been inadvertently mapped as being
in the floodplain, but is actually on natural high ground above the based flood
elevation. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property, portion of a property, or structure is not
located in a special flood hazard area.
(b) Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data that may
show changes to flood zones, flood elevations, special flood hazard area
boundaries and floodway delineations, and other planimetric features.
(c) Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F): A determination that a
structure or parcel of land has been elevated by fill above the BFE and is,
therefore, no longer located within the special flood hazard area. In order to
qualify for this determination, the fill must have been permitted and placed in
accordance with the community’s floodplain management regulations.
(d) Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and comment
as to whether a proposed project complies with minimum NFIP requirements for
such projects with respect to delineation of special flood hazard areas. A
CLOMR does not revise the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map or Flood
Insurance Study; upon submission and approval of certified as-built
documentation, a Letter of Map Revision may be issued by FEMA to revise the
effective FIRM.
39. Light Duty Truck. Any motor vehicle rated at 8,500 pounds Gross Vehicular Weight or
less which has a vehicular curb weight of 6,000 pounds or less and which has a basic

immediately next to the building, or deck support, after completion of the building.
41. Lowest Floor. Lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An
unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building
access, or limited storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a
building's lowest floor, provided that such an enclosure is not built so as to render the
structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this
ordinance.

residential structure (including manufactured homes) located within a Special Flood Hazard
Area or on any lot where a SFHA is located shall have the reference level, including
basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation.
(c) Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of
any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure shall have the reference level,
including basement, elevated no lower than the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation as
defined by this ordinance. Structures located in the AE Zone may be flood proofed to the
regulatory flood protection elevation Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation in lieu of
elevation provided that all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, below the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation are watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A

registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection
are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the administrator along with the
operational and maintenance plans. (AMENDED 09/26/17)
(d) Manufactured homes. Manufactured homes that are located within a SFHA or on
a lot where a SFHA is located shall be securely anchored to an adequately anchored
foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either by engineer certification,
or in accordance with the most current edition of the State of North Carolina Regulations for
Manufactured Homes adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to NCGS 143-
143.15. Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis thirtysix
(36) inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced
piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is above thirty-six (36)
inches in height, an engineering certification is required. Finally, all enclosures or skirting
below the lowest floor shall meet the requirements of subsection (e).
(f) Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed areas of new construction and substantially
improved structures that are below the lowest floor of buildings located with a
SFHA: (AMENDED 09/26/17)
(1) Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only be
used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to
the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of
vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment
(standard exterior door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).
The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or
partitioned into separate rooms, except to enclose storage areas;
(2) Shall not be temperature controlled or conditioned;
(3) Shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials below
the regulatory flood protection elevation;
(4) Shall include flood openings to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.
To meet this requirement, the openings must either be certified by a
professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following
minimum design criteria;
a. A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
b. The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one (1)
square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
c. If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed
area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to
automatically enter and exit;
Art. XVI. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AND WATERSHED
PROTECTION
Page #21
d. The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher
than one (1) foot above the adjacent grade;
e. Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of
floodwaters in both directions; and
f. Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered
enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not
require flood openings. Masonry or wood underpinning,
regardless of structural status, is considered an enclosure and
requires flood openings as outlined above.
(f) Fill/Grading. (AMENDED 09/26/17)
(1) Fill is prohibited in the SFHA, consistent with this Ordinance.
(2) Property owners shall be required to execute and record a nonconversion
agreement prior to issuance of a building permit declaring that
the area below the lowest floor shall not be improved, finished, or otherwise
converted to habitable space; the Town will have the right to inspect the
enclosed area. The Town will conduct annual inspections. This agreement
shall be recorded with the Orange County Register of Deeds and shall
transfer with the property in perpetuity.
(3) Release of Restrictive Covenants. If a property which is bound
by a non-conversion agreement is modified to remove enclosed area
below BFE, then the owner may request release of restrictive covenants
after staff inspection and submittal of confirming documentation.
(g) Additions/Improvements. With respect to additions and improvements to
structures that are nonconforming because they are located within a Special Flood Hazard
Area: (AMENDED 09/26/17)
(1) When the addition or improvement constitutes a substantial
improvement as defined in Section 15-251.1, both the existing
structure and the addition or improvement must comply with the
standards for new construction.
(2) When the addition or improvement does not constitute a substantial
improvement, the addition or improvement must be designed to
minimize flood damages and must not be any more non-conforming
than the existing structure.
Art. XVI. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AND WATERSHED
PROTECTION
Page #22
(h) Accessory Structures. When accessory structures (sheds, detached garages, etc.)
are allowed to be placed within a Special Flood Hazard Area pursuant to the provisions of
subsection (a) of this section, the following criteria shall be met: (AMENDED 09/26/17)
(1) Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation (including
working, sleeping, living, cooking or restroom areas);
(2) Accessory structures shall not be temperature-controlled;
(3) Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood damage
potential;
(4) Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the building

(5) Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored in accordance with
Section 15-251.8;
(6) All service facilities such as electrical shall be installed in accordance
with Section 15-251.8; and
(7) Flood openings to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood
forces shall be provided below regulatory flood protection elevation in
conformance with Subsection (e) of this section.
(8) An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 square feet that
satisfies the criteria outlined above does not require an elevation or
floodproofing certificate. Elevation or floodproofing certifications are
required for all other accessory structures.
(i) Tanks. When gas and liquid storage tanks are to be placed within a SFHA, the
following criteria shall be met: (AMENDED 09/26/17)
(1) Underground Tanks. Underground tanks in flood hazard areas shall
be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads during conditions of the design flood,
including the effects of buoyancy assuming the tank is empty;
(2) Above-ground Tanks, Elevated. Above-ground tanks in flood hazard
areas shall be elevated to or above the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation
on a supporting structure that is designed to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement during conditions of the design flood. Tank-supporting
structures shall meet the foundation requirements of the applicable flood
hazard area;
Art. XVI. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AND WATERSHED
PROTECTION
Page #23
(3) Above-ground Tanks, Not Elevated. Above-ground tanks that do
not meet the elevation requirements of Section (2) of this ordinance shall be
permitted in flood hazard areas provided the tanks are designed, constructed,
installed, and anchored to resist all flood-related and other loads, including the
effects of buoyancy, during conditions of the design flood and without release
of the contents in the floodwaters or infiltration of floodwaters into the tanks.
Tanks shall be designed, constructed, installed, and anchored to resist the
potential buoyant and other flood forces acting on an empty tank during
design flood conditions.
(4) Tank Inlets and Vents. Tank inlets, fill openings, outlets, and vents
shall be:
a. At or above the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation or
fitted with covers designed to prevent the inflow of floodwater or
outflow of the contents of the tanks during conditions of the design
flood; and
b. Anchored to prevent lateral movement resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy,
during conditions of the design flood.
(j) Subsequent to the effective date of this subsection, no portion of any Special
Flood Hazard Area outside of the floodway may be filled in with fill dirt or similar material
for the purpose of elevating buildings. Whenever fill is placed within a SFHA for any other
permitted purpose, slopes shall be adequately stabilized to withstand the erosive force of the
base flood. (AMENDED 09/26/17)
(k) Other Development.
(1) Fences in regulated floodways and NEAs that have the potential to
block the passage of floodwaters, such as stockade fences and wire mesh
fences, shall meet the limitations of Section 15-251.10 of this ordinance.
(2) Retaining walls, sidewalks, and driveways in regulated floodways or
NEAs that involve the placement of fill in regulated floodways shall meet
the limitations of Section 15-251.10 of this ordinance.
(3) Roads and watercourse crossings in floodways and NEAs, including
roads, bridges, culverts, low-water crossings, and similar means for vehicles
and pedestrians to travel from one side of a watercourse to the other, that
encroach into regulated floodways shall meet the limitations of Section 15-
251.10 of this ordinance. (AMENDED 09/26/17)
Section 15-251.10 Floodways and Non-Encroachment Areas
(a) Areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas are located within
the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Subsection 15-251.2(b) (1). The floodways
and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity of floodwaters
Art. XVI. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AND WATERSHED
PROTECTION
Page #24
that have erosion potential and carry debris and potential projectiles. The requirements set
forth in the remaining provisions of this section, in addition to the standards set forth in
Sections 15-251.8 and 15-251.9 shall apply to all development within such areas.
(b) No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements
or other development shall be permitted within a floodway or non-encroachment area unless:
(AMENDED 11/23/10).
(1) The proposed encroachment would not result in any impact to
the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood, as
demonstrated by hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed
in accordance with standard engineering practice and presented
to the administrator prior to approval of construction plans
authorizing such encroachment; or
(2) A Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) has been
approved by FEMA. Prior to the issuance of a zoning, special,
or conditional use permit, the developer must demonstrate to
the permit issuing authority, by the submission to the town of
the CLOMR study, that it is reasonably likely that a CLOMR
will be issued. The CLOMR must be received by the town
prior to approval of construction plans authorizing such
encroachment.
(b1) When an encroachment within a floodway or non-encroachment area is
authorized pursuant to a CLOMR as provided in subsection (b)(2) of this section, then upon
completion of the encroachment, the developer must obtain from FEMA a Letter of Map
Revision (LOMR) pertaining to such encroachment. If such a LOMR is required for an
encroachment, then (i) if the encroachment occurs within a subdivided development, a final
plat for the phase of the subdivision where the encroachment occurs shall not be approved
until the LOMR has been received by the town, and (ii) if the encroachment occurs within
an unsubdivided development, such property may not be used or occupied until the LOMR
has been received by the town, except that such occupancy, use, or sale of lots shall be
allowed if sufficient security is provided pursuant to Sections 15-53 or 15-60 to ensure that
the developer does what is necessary to obtain the LOMR (AMENDED 11/23/10).
(c) Any development within a floodway or non-encroachment area that is
authorized by this section shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions
of this part.
(d) No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except replacement manufactured
homes in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, provided the following
provisions are met:
Art. XVI. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AND WATERSHED
PROTECTION
Page #25
(1) The anchoring and the elevation standards of Subsection 15-251.9(d);
and
(2) The no encroachment standard of Subsection 15-251.10(b) (1).
Section 15-251.11 Special Provisions for Subdivisions
(a) An applicant for a conditional use permit or special use permit authorizing a
major subdivision and an applicant for minor subdivision final plat approval shall be
informed by the planning department of the use and construction restrictions contained in this
Article if any portion of the land to be subdivided lies within a Special Flood Hazard Area.
(b) A conditional use permit or special use permit for a major subdivision may not
be issued, and final plat approval for any subdivision may not be granted, if any portion of
one or more lots lies within a Special Flood Hazard Area unless it reasonably appears that:
(1) With respect to each lot that lies wholly or partly within a Special
Flood Hazard area, either (i) a building of the type that is consistent
with the zoning of the property can practicably be located in
accordance with applicable regulations on the portion of such lot that
is located outside the SFHA, or (ii) such lot has already been
developed, or (iii) such lot is formed as the result of an adjustment of
lot lines between lots in existence on the effective date of this section,
and such readjustment does not result in a previously developable lot
being rendered undevelopable, or (iv) it plainly appears that such lot is
intended to be devoted to a permissible use that does not involve the
construction of any building (e.g. that such lot is reserved or dedicated
for open space purposes).
(2) Creation of each lot that does not satisfy the criteria set forth in
subdivision (1) of this subsection is necessary to avoid depriving the
owner of the property of all reasonable use of the tract taken as a
whole.
(c) Final plat approval for any subdivision containing land that lies within a
Special Flood Hazard Area may not be given unless the plat shows the boundary of the SFHA
according to the best information available at the time the final plat is approved and contains
in clearly discernible print the following statement: “Use of land within a special flood
hazard area is substantially restricted by Article XVI of Chapter 15 of the Carrboro Town
Code.” If, at the time final plat approval is granted, a Conditional Letter of Map Revision
(CLOMR) affecting such subdivision has been approved, or the town is otherwise aware that
some action is pending that would likely alter the location of the boundary of the SFHA as it
affects such subdivision, then the statement on such plat referenced immediately above shall
include a note similar to the following: “The location of the boundary of the special flood
hazard area may be altered by a request for a special flood hazard map revision now
pending before the Federal Emergency Management Agency.”

PART II. STORM WATER MANAGEMENT
Section 15-261 Natural Drainage System Utilized to Extent Feasible (REWRITTEN
6/27/07) AMENDED 2/21/12) .
(a) To the extent practicable, all development shall conform to the natural contours
of the land and natural drainage ways shall remain undisturbed.
(b) To the extent practicable, lot boundaries shall be made to coincide with natural
drainage ways within subdivisions to avoid the creation of lots that can be built upon only by
altering such natural drainage ways.
(c) Drainage or filling in of existing ponds, under circumstances where the
requirements of Section 15-263 are not applicable, shall only be allowed if the stormwater
management benefits of the pond are otherwise provided for through installation of other
stormwater management devices or practices deemed suitable by the Administrator.
(AMENDED 2-21/12)
Section 15-262 Development Must Drain Properly (REWRITTEN 6/27/07)
(a) All development shall be provided with a stormwater management system
containing drainage facilities that are adequately designed and constructed to prevent the
undue retention of surface water on the development site. Surface water shall not be regarded
as unduly retained if:
(1) The retention results from a technique, practice or device deliberately
installed as part of an approved sedimentation or stormwater
management plan, or
(2) The retention is not substantially different in location or degree than
that experienced by the development site in its pre-development stage,
unless such retention presents a danger to health or safety.
(b) No surface water may be channeled or directed into the OWASA sanitary
sewer system.
(c) Whenever practicable, the drainage system of a development shall coordinate
with the drainage system or drainage ways on surrounding properties or streets.
(d) Use of drainage swales rather than curb and gutter and storm sewers in
subdivisions is provided for in Section 15-216. Private roads and access ways within
unsubdivided developments shall utilize curb and gutter and storm drains to provide adequate
Art. XVI. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AND WATERSHED
PROTECTION
Page #28
drainage if the grade of such roads or access ways is too steep to provide drainage in another
manner or if other sufficient reasons exist to require such construction.
(e) The minimum design storm frequency for all drainage systems shall be the 10
year storm, except that those facilities crossing streets shall be designed for the 25 year storm.
(f) Drainage culverts and associated facilities shall be suitably sized to
accommodate designated storm frequencies and shall be suitably constructed and installed to
insure that the facilities will function adequately and will not deteriorate within an
unreasonably short period of time. (AMENDED 04/03/90)
Section 15-263 Management of Stormwater (REWRITTEN 6/26/07; AMENDED
6/24/08; AMENDED 10/28/08; 6/22/10; 11/23/10; REWRITTEN 6/26/12)
(a) The requirements of this section shall apply to developments to the extent
provided in this subsection.
(1) For purposes of this subsection, “impervious surface” means that portion of
the development of a lot or tract that is covered by a surface or material that
substantially or completely prevents rainwater from reaching and being
absorbed into the underlying soil. Impervious surfaces include but are not
limited to streets, driveways, sidewalks, parking lots, buildings, and other
roofed, paved, or graveled areas. Wooden slatted decks and the water area of
swimming pools are considered pervious, as are detention ponds.
(2) For purposes of this subsection, “net addition of impervious surface” shall be
determined by subtracting the total square footage of impervious surface prior
to commencement of construction authorized by a development permit from
the total square footage of impervious that is proposed to be located on the
development site when all construction authorized by the development permit
(including all phases thereof) is completed. If the permit issuing authority
reasonably concludes that a permit applicant is seeking or has sought separate
permits (simultaneously or sequentially) for different components of what is
demonstrably intended to be a single development in an attempt to stay below
the impervious surface threshold that triggers the requirements set forth in
this section, then the permit issuing authority shall treat such multiple
applications as a single application for purposes of determining whether the
requirements of this section are applicable.
(3) All unsubdivided developments that involve a net addition of more than 5,000
square feet of impervious surface shall be subject to the requirements of this
section, except that these requirements shall not apply if the total of the net
addition of impervious surface area plus the previously existing impervious
surface area on the lot does not exceed (i) six percent (6%) of the lot area
within a B-5 or WM-3 zoning district, or (ii) for lots in all other zoning
Art. XVI. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AND WATERSHED
PROTECTION
Page #29
districts, the amount of impervious surface area permissible on lots within the
C or WR zoning districts under subsection 15-266(b) of this part.
(4) When land is subdivided, and the permit authorizing the subdivision does not
itself authorize the net addition of more than 5,000 square feet of impervious
surface to the tract to be subdivided, then the requirements of this section
shall not be applicable to the subdivision. The applicability of the
requirements of this section to each of the individual lots so created shall then
be determined as development permits are issued for each such lot.
(5) When land is subdivided, and the permit authorizing the subdivision itself
authorizes the net addition of more than 5,000 square feet of impervious
surface to the tract to be subdivided (regardless of whether such impervious
surface consists of a road or other facilities external to the lots so created, or
buildings, parking lots, and other facilities constructed within the lots so
created, or a combination of the two), then the subdivision shall comply with
the requirements of this section. Furthermore, the stormwater management
system that is installed to comply with the provisions of this section shall be
required to take into account all the stormwater reasonably expected to be
generated by the development (according to generally accepted engineering
standards) when all subdivided lots five acres or less in size are fully
developed. When such lots are subsequently developed, they shall be exempt
from further review under the provisions of this section. However, any lot
within such subdivision that is greater than five acres in size and that was not
included in the stormwater calculations for purposes of designing a
stormwater management system that satisfies the requirements of this section
shall be required to comply with the requirements of this section at the time
such lot is developed, if and to the extent required to do so under subsection
(a)(3) of this section.
(6) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, if (i) a lot is within a
commercial district described in Section 15-136 or a manufacturing district
described in 15-137, (ii) on the date that a development permit application is
submitted and the fees paid the lot is already developed to the extent that the
lot contains at least 10,000 square feet of impervious surface area, and (iii)
the reasonably estimated cost of the redevelopment of the lot as proposed in
the development permit application exceeds the greater of $100,000, or fifty
percent (50%) of the appraised value of the existing improvements on the lot,
then the requirements of this section shall be applicable to such
redevelopment. For purposes of this subdivision (a)(6), the terms “cost” and
“appraised value” shall have the same meaning as provided in Subsection 15-
125(c) of this chapter.
(7) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, the requirements of
this section shall apply to any development involving the reconstruction of a
previously paved area comprising at least 10,000 square feet (repaving or
resurfacing shall not be considered reconstruction).
Art. XVI. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AND WATERSHED
PROTECTION
Page #30
(8) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection (but subject to the
provisions of subsection (a)(8)f below), the requirements of this section shall
apply to all proposed new development that cumulatively disturbs one acre
or more for single family and duplex residential property and recreational
facilities, and one-half acre for commercial, industrial, institutional,
multifamily residential, or local government property. For purposes of this
subsection (a)(8) only:
a. Development means any land disturbing activity which adds to or
changes the amount of impervious or partially impervious cover on
a land area or which otherwise decreases the infiltration of
precipitation into the soil.
b. New development means any development project that does not
meet the definition of existing development set forth immediately
below.
c. Existing development means development not otherwise exempted
from the provisions of this section that meets one of the following
criteria: (i) it either is built or has established a vested right based
on statutory or common law grounds as of the effective date of this
section, or (ii) it occurs after the effective date of this section but
does not result in a net increase in impervious surface area and
does not increase the infiltration of precipitation into the soil..
d. Land disturbing activity means any use of the land that results in a
change in the natural cover or topography that may cause or
contribute to sedimentation.
e. Larger common plan of development or sale means any area where
multiple separate and distinct construction or land-disturbing activities
will occur under one plan. A plan is any announcement or piece of
documentation (including but not limited to a sign, public notice or
hearing, sales pitch, advertisement, loan application, drawing, permit
application, zoning request, or computer design) or physical demarcation
(including but not limited to boundary signs, lot stakes, or surveyor
markings) indicating that construction activities may occur on a specific
plot.
f. Redevelopment means any development on previously developed
land.
(b) Developments must install and maintain stormwater management systems that
will control and treat runoff from the first one inch of rain as follows:
(1) Draw down the treatment volume in accordance with the requirements of
Art. XVI. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AND WATERSHED
PROTECTION
Page #31
the North Carolina Division of Water Quality Best Management Practices
(NC DWQ BMP) Manual.
(2) Achieve an eighty-five percent (85%) average annual removal rate for Total
Suspended Solids.
(c) Subject to subsections (d) and (f), developments must install and maintain
stormwater management systems that ensure that the nutrient load contributed by the
development is limited to not more than 2.2 pounds per acre per year of nitrogen and 0.82
pounds per acre per year of phosphorus.
(d) Subject to subsection (f), developments that (i) would otherwise be required
under subsection (a) to comply with the stormwater treatment standards set forth in
subsection (c), and (ii) involve the replacement or expansion of existing structures or
improvements, shall have the option of either satisfying the requirements of subsection (c) of
this section or achieving a thirty-five percent (35%) nitrogen and five percent (5%)
phosphorous reduction in the loading rates for these nutrients when comparing the situation
that exists on the date a completed application is submitted to the post redevelopment
situation for the entire project site.
(e) The need for engineered stormwater controls to meet the nutrient loading rate
standards set forth in subsections (c) and (d) shall be determined by using the loading
calculation methods and other standards established by the Division of Water Quality as set
forth in Sub-Item (4)(a) of 15A NCAC 2B.0265, including the current version of the
Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual published by the Division.
(f) Developers shall have the option of offsetting part of their nitrogen and
phosphorus loads by implementing or funding offsite management measures as follows:
(1) Before using offsite offset options, a development shall attain a maximum
nitrogen loading rate on-site of six pounds per acre per year for singlefamily
detached and duplex residential development and ten pounds per
acre per year for other development, including multi-family residential,
commercial and industrial, and shall meet any requirement for engineered
stormwater controls required by this Article..
(2) Offsite offsetting measures shall achieve at least equivalent reductions in
nitrogen and phosphorus loading to the remaining reduction needed onsite
to comply with the loading rate standards set forth in subsection (c) of this
section.
(3) A developer may make offset payments to the N.C. Ecosystem
Enhancement Program contingent upon acceptance of payments by that
Program. A developer may use an offset option provided by the Town of
Carrboro, or may propose other offset measures including providing the
Art. XVI. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AND WATERSHED
PROTECTION
Page #32
developer’s own offsite offset or utilizing a private seller. All offset
measures shall meet the requirements of 15A NCAC 02B.0273(2) through
(4) and 15A NCAC 02B.0240.
(g) Developments shall be constructed and maintained so that their stormwater
management systems meet the following minimum standards:
Art. XVI. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AND WATERSHED
PROTECTION
Page #33
(1) The post-development discharge rates shall be less than or equal to the predevelopment
discharge rates for the 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, and 25-year 24-hour
design storms.
(2) For upstream properties, the 1% chance flood elevation may not be increased.
(3) The Board finds that increases in the total annual volume of runoff
associated with new development results in decreased groundwater
recharge, increased stream channel instability/erosion and significant water
quality degradation. Therefore to the maximum extent practicable
developments shall install and maintain stormwater management systems
such that the post-development total annual stormwater runoff volume
shall not exceed the predevelopment volume by more than the limits set
forth in the table below. The predevelopment and post-development
annual stormwater runoff volume shall be calculated using the Jordan
Lake Accounting Tool (“JLAT”), except that the following inputs for the
use of permeable pavement shall apply. If the NCDENR Division of
Water Quality (DWQ) revises the following table of inputs for the use of
permeable pavement, this subsection shall be deemed amended to
incorporate the most recent inputs established by DWQ. (AMENDED
6/26/12) (AMENDED 2/26/13)
A composite curve number shall be assigned to the development site in the
pre-development stage using the runoff curve number method described in
USDA NRCS Technical Release 55, Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds (June, 1986). See also Chapters 4 through 10 of NEH-4, SCS
(1985).

(h) The presumption established by this section is that, to satisfy the standards set
forth herein, the applicant shall design and construct all stormwater management systems
required by this section in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the Town of Carrboro
Storm Drainage Design Manual (Appendix I to this chapter). However, the permit issuing
authority may establish different requirements when it concludes, based upon (i) the information
it receives in the consideration of the specific development proposal, and (ii) the
recommendations of the public works director or the town engineer, that such deviations from
the presumptive guidelines are necessary to satisfy the standards set forth in this section, or that
the standards can still be met with such deviations and the deviations are otherwise warranted.
(i) Approval by the town of an applicant’s stormwater management plans, and
construction by the applicant of the stormwater management system as shown in such plans,
shall not relieve the applicant of the responsibility of complying with the standards set forth in
this section. If at any time prior to two years after the date that the town concludes that a
stormwater management system (or any component thereof) has been constructed in accordance
with approved plans, the town determines that the stormwater management system (or any
component thereof) installed to meet the requirements of this section does not achieve that
objective, the town may require the submission of revised plans and the installation of new,
altered, or additional facilities to bring the development into compliance. Prior to issuance of a
certificate of occupancy or approval of a final plat, the town may require the applicant to post a
performance bond or other sufficient surety to guarantee compliance with this section.
(AMENDED 1/29/13)
(j) Upon completion of construction of the stormwater management facilities, the
permit recipient shall submit to the town “as built” plans for all such facilities in the form
required by the town. Compliance with this requirement must occur prior to issuance of a
certificate of occupancy, or prior to final plat approval (if applicable), unless adequate
security is otherwise provided in accordance with the provisions of Sections 15-53 or 15-60.
(k) Proposed new development undertaken by the Town solely as a public road
project shall be deemed compliant with the provisions of this section if it meets the buffer
protection requirements of Part III of this Article. All other developments shall comply with
both the requirements of this section and the provisions of Part III of this Article.
(l) Variances from the provisions of this section may only be granted in
accordance with the requirements of Section 15-92, including subsection (l) of that section.

Section 15-263.1 Maintenance of Structural BMPs.
(a) For purposes of this section, a “structural BMP” is a device constructed or
installed to trap, settle out, or filter pollutants from stormwater runoff or to reduce stormwater
discharge volume or velocity in order to satisfy one or more of the requirements of Section
15-263.
(b) The owner of each structural BMP installed pursuant to this ordinance shall
maintain and operate it so as to preserve and continue its function in controlling stormwater
quality and quantity at the degree or amount of function for which the structural BMP was
designed. Such operation and maintenance shall be in accordance with the Operation and
Maintenance Agreement specified in subsection (e) of this section.
(c) The owner of each structural BMP shall ensure that each such facility is
inspected in accordance with the Operation and Maintenance Agreement specified in
subsection (e) of this section by a qualified registered North Carolina professional or other
individual specially qualified by an appropriate training, testing, and certification program.
The person performing the inspections shall submit annually to the administrator a report
certifying the results of such inspections. The report shall be in a format and shall contain the
information prescribed by the administrator. The first report shall be due one year from the
date of the as built certification required by Subsection 15-263(i), and subsequent reports
shall be due on or before that anniversary date.
(d) The owner of each structural BMP shall ensure that, in accordance with the
Operation and Maintenance Agreement, funds are set aside in an escrow account, sinking
fund, or other arrangement, sufficient to pay major, non-routine costs associated with keeping
such BMPs in proper operational condition, such as the cost of sediment removal, structural,
biological, or vegetative replacement, major repair, or reconstruction. The owner shall
submit annually to the administrator a report certifying that such funds have been set aside.
The report shall be in a format and shall contain the information prescribed by the
administrator. The first report shall be due one year from the date of the as-built certification
required by Subsection 15-263(i), and subsequent reports shall be due on or before that
anniversary date.
(e) Prior to final plat approval, in the case of a subdivision, or prior to the
issuance of a certificate of occupancy, in the case of an unsubdivided development, the owner
of a development that contains a structural BMP shall enter into an Operation and
Maintenance Agreement with the town (and shall record such agreement in the Orange
County Registry) that specifies that the owner, and his or her successor and assigns:
(1) Agrees to comply with the obligations set forth in subsections (b), (c), and
(d) of this section;
(2) Authorizes the town and its employees or agents to enter the property
where the structural BMPs are located at reasonable times to inspect the
Art. XVI. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AND WATERSHED
PROTECTION
Page #36
same for compliance with the requirements of this section, the permit
issued pursuant thereto, and the provisions of the Operation and
Maintenance Agreement;
(3) Agrees that, if the owner fails to operate and maintain such structural
BMPs in accordance with the requirements of this section, the permit
issued pursuant thereto, and the provisions of the Operation and
Maintenance Agreement, the town is authorized (but not obligated) to
enter the property to perform such work as is necessary to bring such
BMPs into compliance and to charge the owner with the costs of such
work.
(f) If structural BMPs are to be owned by a property owners or homeowners
association or similar entity, then the covenants applicable to such association shall clearly
reference the obligations of the association, as owner of such BMPs, to fulfill the obligations
of the owner relating to such BMPs as required by the provisions of this section, the permit
issued pursuant thereto, and the provisions of the Operation and Maintenance Agreement.
(g) If a structural BMP is located within a subdivision, then the recorded plat of such
subdivision shall include a reference to the book and page number where the Operation and
Maintenance Agreement is recorded. (AMENDED 6/26/12)
(h) Where appropriate in the determination of the Administrator to assure compliance
with this section, structural BMPs shall be posted with a conspicuous sign stating who is
responsible for required maintenance and annual inspection. The sign shall be maintained so
as to remain visible and legible. (AMENDED 6/26/12)
Section 15-264 Sedimentation and Erosion Control
(a) No zoning, special use, or conditional use permit may be issued and final plat
approval for subdivisions may not be given with respect to any development that would cause
land disturbing activity subject to the jurisdiction of the Orange County Erosion Control Officer
or the North Carolina Sedimentation Control Commission unless such officer or agency has
certified to the town; either that:
(1) Any permit required by such officer or agency has been issued or any
erosion control plan required by such officer or agency has been
approved; or
(2) Such officer or agency has examined the preliminary plans for the
development and it reasonably appears that any required permit or
erosion control plan can be approved upon submission by the developer
of more detailed construction or design drawings. However, in this case,
construction of the development may not begin (and no building permits
Art. XVI. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AND WATERSHED
PROTECTION
Page #37
may be issued) until such officer or agency issues any required permit or
approves any required erosion control plan.
(b) For purposes of this section, “land disturbing activity” means any use of the land
by any person in residential, industrial, educational, institutional or commercial development,
highway and road construction and maintenance that results in a change in the natural cover or
topography and that may cause or contribute to sedimentation. Sedimentation occurs whenever
solid particulate matter, mineral or organic, is transported by water, air, gravity, or ice from the
site of its origin.
(c) The Orange County Erosion Control Officer is authorized by resolution of the
Carrboro Board of Aldermen to enforce within the town the Orange County Soil Erosion and
Sedimentation Control Ordinance. (AMENDED 12/7/83)
(d) (REPEALED 12/7/83)
Section 15-265 (REPEALED 3/24/09).
Section 15-266 Impervious Surface Limitations (AMENDED 12/7/83; 05/15/90)
(a) Within a B-5 or WM-3 zoning district (the total area of which comprises less
than one percent of the are of the University Lake Watershed and all of which is located more
than one-half mile from the normal pool elevation of University Lake), not more than twentyfour
percent (24%) of the land on any lot may be covered by an impervious surface such as a
street, drive, sidewalk, parking lot, building, or other roofed structure, etc. In the event that the
area of impervious surface is greater than six percent (6%) of the total lot, stormwater
management techniques must be employed that would retain the first one inch of rainfall
running off of all impervious surfaces on a lot. A registered engineer must certify that the
stormwater techniques used will accomplish this objective before a permit is issued, and it shall
be a continuing condition of the permit that the owner provide necessary maintenance so that
the stormwater retention techniques continue to function effectively. Such stormwater retention
techniques shall be subject to inspection by the Town at least annually. In granting the
conditional use permit authorizing such facilities, the Board shall require the developer to post a
cash bond or other sufficient security to guarantee that the developer or his successor shall
adequately maintain such stormwater retention facilities so that such facilities will continue to
operate as intended. (AMENDED 07/06/93; 10/15/96)
(b) Subject to subsections (c) and (d), within a C or WR zoning district the
maximum impervious surface coverage permissible on any lot shall be as shown in the
following Table of Impervious Surface Calculations, which establishes a sliding scale of
permissible impervious surface coverage based on lot size. For purposes of applying the table,
lot sizes shall be rounded to the nearest tenth of an acre. Lot sizes of less than 0.5 acres may not
exceed 4200 square feet of impervious surface, and lot sizes in excess of five acres may not
exceed an impervious surface area equal to 4% of the lot size. For purposes of this subsection,
Art. XVI. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AND WATERSHED
PROTECTION

(c) If a tract is subdivided, then impervious surface shall be calculated as follows:
(1) The area of each lot shown on a proposed final plat shall be calculated. For
purposes of this calculation, all street right-of-way created as part of the
subdivision shall be allocated to the adjoining lots by extending lot lines. If
lots are created on either side of a proposed street, lot lines shall be extended
to the centerline of the right-of-way.
(2) Maximum impervious surface area for each lot shall be determined in
accordance with subsections (a) or (b).
(3) The sum total of impervious surface area permissible on the entire tract shall
be determined by adding together the impervious surface area available to
each lot as determined under subsections (a) or (b).
(4) The impervious surface area within streets and other areas, (such as common
areas) outside of individual lot boundaries shall be subtracted from the total
area calculated pursuant to subsection (3).
(5) Following the calculation set forth in subsection (4), the remaining
permissible impervious surface area shall be allocated by the subdivide to
each lot, subject to the applicable limitations set forth in this section, and
subject to the further limitation that, with respect to a cluster subdivision, in
no case may the overall impervious surface area allocation for the
subdivided tract exceed 4% of the area of that tract. For purposes of this
calculation, the area of each lot shall exclude street right-of-way. The
allocation assigned to each lot shall be indicated on the face of the
subdivision final plat, and purchasers of each lot shall be bound by such
allocation.
(d) If a development is completed in phases or stages, the percentage restrictions set
forth in this section shall apply to each separate phase or stage.
(e) All development within the JLWP that requires a sedimentation and erosion control
plan under 15A NCAC 4 or the Orange County Sedimentation and Erosion Control Ordinance shall
be subject to the following requirements:
(1) Density and built-upon area shall be limited as follows:
a. For single family residential subdivisions, minimum lot sizes of
20,000 square feet or maximum of two dwelling units per acre; or
b. Twenty-four percent built-upon area for all other residential and nonresidential
development; or
Art. XVI. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AND WATERSHED
PROTECTION
Page #41
c. Three dwelling units per acre or thirty-six percent built-upon area for
properties without curb and gutter systems.
(2) Stormwater runoff from such developments shall be transported by
vegetated conveyances to the maximum extent practicable. (AMENDED
10/15/96)
(f) For purposes of this section, the term “built-upon area” means that portion of a
development project that is covered by impervious or partially impervious cover, including
buildings, pavement, gravel areas (e.g. roads, parking lots, paths), recreation facilities (e.g. tennis
courts), etc. Wooden slatted decks and the water area of a swimming pool are considered pervious.

capacity of the land and (ii) avoid areas described in subsection 15-198(e) and (f). (AMENDED
09/05/95).
(b) To avoid the creation of lots that will be difficult to build upon in a manner that
complies with the standard set forth in subsection (a) and the impervious surface limitations set
forth in Section 15-266, preliminary and final plats for the subdivision of land within the C and WR
zoning districts shall show buildable area and approximate driveway locations for all lots within
such subdivision. Thereafter, no zoning permit may be issued for construction of buildings or
driveways outside the buildable areas so designated on the final plat unless the zoning administrator
makes a written finding that the proposed location complies with the provisions of subsection (a) of
this section as well as section 15-266.

PART III. WATER QUALITY BUFFERS
Section 15-269 Findings, Purpose and Applicability (REPEALED AND REWRITTEN
3/24/09; REWRITTEN 10/26/10; AMENDED 3/4/14)
(a) The Board finds that:
(1) Soil and pollutants carried overland from upstream land uses can be
effectively trapped by leaving a relatively undisturbed strip of vegetation
parallel and adjacent to a drainage feature.
(2) Properly managed overland water flow can be directed into this water quality
buffer area in a manner that will minimize the concentration of flow and
promote diffuse flow and infiltration of the water.
(3) Sediments and other pollutants carried by water will be reduced as a result of
the dispersion and infiltration of flow and associated filtering, absorption,
and uptake of pollutants.
(b) The purpose of this part is to protect, preserve, and enhance water quality buffers in
order to maintain their pollutant removal functions and protect the quality of surface
waters and water supplies. With regard to the Jordan Buffer Rules, it should be noted
that nutrient removal is the primary function of riparian buffers. The NC Division of
Water Quality shall administer the portion of these requirements of Rule 15 A NCAC
02B .0267 and .0268 (Jordan Water Supply Nutrient Strategy: Protection of Existing
Riparian Buffers and Mitigation of Existing Riparian Buffers, respectively) for
activities conducted under the authority of the State, the United States, multiple
jurisdictions, or local units of governments, and forest harvesting and agricultural
activities. The Town of Carrboro shall administer those provisions for all other
landowners and shall administer the remaining provisions of this Article for all other
land disturbing activities and developments.
(c) Wetlands adjacent to surface waters or within 50 feet of surface waters shall be
considered as part of the water quality buffers but are also regulated pursuant to other
State and Federal regulations.
Section 15-269.1 Definitions
For purposes of this part, the following terms shall have the meaning as indicated:
(a) ‘Access Trails’ means pedestrian trails constructed of pervious or impervious
surfaces, and related structures to access a surface water including boardwalks,
steps, rails, signage.
Art. XVI. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AND WATERSHED
PROTECTION
Page #43
(b) Archaeological Activities’ means activities conducted by a Registered
Professional Archaeologist (RPA).
(c) ‘Buffer’ means a water quality buffer, or an undeveloped area parallel and
adjacent to a drainage feature to protect and enhance water quality.
(d) ‘DBH’ means diameter at breast height of a tree measured at 4.5 feet above
ground surface level.
(e) ‘Development’ means the same as defined in Rule 15A NCAC 2B .0202(23).
(f) ‘Diffuse flow’ means flow that generally moves down slope via sheet flow
rather than concentrating in rills, gullies, and ditches and in doing so is able to
infiltrate into the soil and plant root zone.
(g) ‘Ditch’ means a man-made channel other than a modified natural stream.
(h) ‘Ephemeral stream’ means a drainage feature that carries only surface runoff in
direct response to precipitation. An ephemeral stream may or may not have a
well-defined channel and the stream bed is always above the water table. An
ephemeral stream lacks the biological, hydrological, and physical characteristics
commonly associated with perennial or intermittent streams.
(i) ‘Existing development’ means development, other than that associated with
agricultural or forest management activities that meets one of the following
criteria:
1. It either is built or has established a vested right based on statutory or
common law as interpreted by the courts, for projects that do not require a
state permit, as of the effective date of either local new development
stormwater programs implemented under Rule 15A NCAC 2B .0265
(Jordan Water Supply Nutrient Strategy: Stormwater Management for
New Development) or, for projects requiring a state permit, as of the
applicable compliance date established in Rule 15A NCAC 2B .0271
(Jordan Water Supply Nutrient Strategy: Stormwater Management for
New Development), Items (5) and (6); or
2. It occurs after the compliance date set out in Sub-Item (4)(d) of Rule
.0265 (Jordan Water Supply Nutrient Strategy: Stormwater Management
for New Development) but does not result in a net increase in built-upon
area.
(j) ‘Greenway / Hiking Trails’ means pedestrian and bicycle trails constructed of
pervious or impervious surfaces and related structures including but not limited
to boardwalks, steps, rails, and signage and that generally run parallel to the
shoreline.
(k) ‘High Value Tree’ means a tree that meets or exceeds the following standards: for
pine species, 14-inch DBH or greater or 18-inch or greater stump diameter; or for
hardwoods and wetland species, 16-inch DBH or greater or 24-inch or greater
stump diameter.
Art. XVI. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AND WATERSHED
PROTECTION
Page #44
(l) ‘Intermittent stream’ means a well-defined channel that contains water for only
part of the year, typically during winter and spring when the aquatic bed is below
the water table. The flow may be heavily supplemented by stormwater runoff.
An intermittent stream often lacks the biological and hydrological characteristics
commonly associated with the continuous conveyance of water.
(m) ‘New development,’ for the purpose of this Article, means any development
project that does not meet the definition of existing development set out in this
Section.
(n) ‘Perennial stream’ means a well-defined channel that contains water year round
during a year of normal rainfall with the aquatic bed located below the water
table for most of the year. Groundwater is the primary source of water for a
perennial stream, but it also carries stormwater runoff. A perennial stream
exhibits the typical biological, hydrological, and physical characteristics
commonly associated with the continuous conveyance of water.
(o) For purposes of this Article only, ‘Public utility’ means any governmental entity,
nonprofit organization, corporation, or any entity defined as a public utility for any
purpose by Section 62.3 of the North Carolina General Statutes that is engaged in
the production, generation, transmission, delivery, collection, or storage of water,
sewage electricity, gas, oil, or electronic signals
(p) ‘Riparian buffer enhancement’ is defined as the process of converting a nonforested
riparian area, where woody vegetation density is greater than or equal to
100 trees per acre but less than 200 trees per acre, to a forested riparian buffer
area. The enhanced, forested riparian buffer area shall include at least two native
hardwood tree species planted at a density sufficient to provide 320 trees per acres
at maturity, and diffuse flow through the riparian buffer shall be maintained.
(q) ‘Riparian buffer restoration’ is defined as the process of converting a non-forested
riparian area, where woody vegetation density is less than 100 trees per acre, to a
forested riparian buffer area. The restored, forested riparian buffer area shall
include predominately native hardwood tree species planted at a density sufficient
to provide 320 trees per acres at maturity, and diffuse flow through the riparian
buffer shall be maintained.
(r) ‘Shoreline stabilization’ is the in-place stabilization of an eroding shoreline.
Stabilization techniques which include “soft” methods or natural materials (such
as root wads or rock vanes) may be considered as part of a restoration design.
However, stabilization techniques that consist primarily of “hard” engineering,
such as concrete line channels, riprap or gabions, while providing bank
stabilization, shall not be considered stream restoration.
(s) ‘Stream’ means a body of concentrated flowing water in a natural low area or
natural channel on the land surface.
(t) ‘Stream restoration’ is defined as the process of converting an unstable, altered or
degraded stream corridor, including adjacent riparian zone and flood-prone areas
to its natural or referenced, stable conditions considering recent and future
watershed conditions. This process also includes restoring the geomorphic
dimension, pattern, and profile as well as biological and chemical integrity,
including transport of water and sediment produced by the stream’s watershed in
Art. XVI. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AND WATERSHED
PROTECTION
Page #45
order to achieve dynamic equilibrium. ‘Referenced’ or ‘referenced reach’ means
a stable stream that is in dynamic equilibrium with its valley and contributing
watershed. A reference reach can be used to develop natural channel design
criteria for stream restoration projects.
(u) ‘Stump diameter’ means the diameter of a tree measured at six inches above the
ground surface level.
(v) ‘Surface waters’ means any ephemeral, intermittent, or perennial stream, lake,
pond, or reservoir, and including waters of the state as defined in G.S. 143-212
except underground waters”.
(w) ‘Temporary road’ means a road constructed temporarily for equipment access to
build or replace hydraulic conveyance structures or water dependent structures, or
to maintain public traffic during construction.
(x) ‘Tree,’ for the purposes of this Part, means a woody plant with a DBH equal to or
exceeding five inches or a stump diameter exceeding six inches.
(y) ‘Water dependent structures’ are those structures for which the use requires access
or proximity to or siting within surface waters to fulfill its basic purpose, such as
boat ramps, boat houses, docks and bulkheads.
Section 15-269.2 Required Buffers
(a) Subject to the remaining provisions of this part, the water quality buffer areas
described in this section are hereby designated as described below. The width of
these buffers shall be as prescribed in Section 15-269.3. Disturbance of the area
within, or outside causing hydrologic impacts upon, these buffers is restricted or
prohibited as provided in Sections 15-269.4 and 15- 269.5
(b) Buffers shall be established adjacent to all surface waters designated as such on
either the most recent version of the soil survey map prepared by the Natural
Resources Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture,
ii the most recent version of the 1:24,000 scale (7.5 minute) quadrangle
topographic maps prepared by the United States Geologic Survey (USGS), or iii
other more accurate mapping approved by the Geographic Information
Coordinating Council (GICC) and the N.C. Environmental Management
Commission (EMC). Prior to approving a map under item iii., the EMC shall
provide a 30-day public notice and opportunity for public comment.
(1) If surface water is not designated as such on any of the foregoing
maps, then the buffer requirements of this article applicable to
perennial streams, intermittent streams, lakes, or ponds that are
shown on such maps shall not apply, but buffers applicable to
ephemeral streams may apply.
(2) Where the specific origination point of a stream is in question, a
publication of the N.C. Division of Water Quality entitled
Identification Methods for the Origins of Intermittent and
Perennial Streams shall be used by town representatives who have
Art. XVI. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AND WATERSHED
PROTECTION
Page #46
successfully completed the Division’s Surface Water Identification
Training Certification course to establish that point.
(3) When a landowner or other affected party believes that surface
waters shown on the above described maps have been inaccurately
depicted as perennial streams, intermittent stream, lakes or ponds,
then such landowner or other affected party may have an on-site
evaluation completed by a party who has successfully completed
the NC Division of Water Quality Surface Water Identification
Training Certification course, its successor, or other equivalent
training curriculum approved by the Division, and submit the
results of that evaluation to the town. Any disputes over onsite
determinations made according to this Item shall be referred to the
Director of the Division of Water Quality c/o the 401 Oversight
Express Permitting Unit, or its successor, in writing. The
Director’s determination is subject to review as provided in
Articles 3 and 4 of G.S. 150B.
(c) Buffers shall also be established adjacent to all ephemeral streams and ponds not
shown on the above described maps that have a contributing drainage area that is
at least five acres in size, as depicted in the Town’s GIS database.
(1) When a landowner or other affected party believes that the
designation of an area by the town as an ephemeral stream or pond
with a contributing drainage area of at least five acres is in error,
such landowner or other affected party may request that Town
staff perform an onsite visit and/or submit to the Town data
sufficient to make this case. Upon request, Town staff shall make
a site visit and consider the information submitted by the
landowner or other affected party as well as other relevant
information.
(2) The decision as to the existence of an ephemeral stream or pond
with a contributing drainage area of at least five acres shall be
made by the permit issuing authority when it makes a final decision
on the issuance of the permit.
(d) The administrator may require that the precise location of any surface water be
Surveyed and accurately shown on development plans whenever necessary to
ensure that a proposed development complies with the provisions of this article.
Section 15-269.3 Width of Buffers
(a) ZONES OF THE RIPARIAN BUFFER. The protected riparian buffer shall have
two zones as follows:
Art. XVI. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AND WATERSHED
PROTECTION
Page #47
(1) A streamside zone (“Zone 1’) shall consist of an undisturbed area except as
provided for in Section 15-269.5. The function of the streamside zone is to
protect the physical and ecological integrity of the stream ecosystem, and
filter runoff received from Zone 2. The desired vegetation for Zone 1 is
mature forest. The location of Zone 1 shall be as follows:
a. Zone 1 shall begin at the most landward limit of the top of the bank.
Zone 1 shall extend landward on either side of perennial and intermittent
stream, and ephemeral streams with clearly defined streambanks, as
indicated in Table 1, measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to a
vertical line marking the origin of the buffer as defined above. For
ephemeral streams without clearly defined streambanks, Zone 1 shall be
measured from the centerline of the stream.
b. For ponds, lakes and reservoirs, Zone 1 shall begin at the most landward
limit of the normal water level and extend landward as indicated in Table
1, measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to a vertical line marking
the edge of the surface water.
(2) Zone 2 shall consist of an undisturbed area except as provided for in Section
15-269.5. The functions of this zone are to: protect the streamside zone, to
filter runoff from upland development, and deliver runoff to Zone 1 in a
dispersed fashion. Grading and revegetating Zone 2 is allowed provided that
the health of the vegetation in Zone 1 is not compromised. Zone 2 shall
begin at the outer edge of Zone 1 and extend landward as indicated in Table 1
as measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to the surface water. The
desired vegetation for this zone is mature native vegetation; forest cover is
encouraged.
(3) The total buffer width shall be the sum of the widths of the two zones, as
indicated in Table 1, and shall extend on all sides of the waterbody.

(4) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, in no case shall the
width of any buffer be less extensive than the special flood hazard area for
the same stream, pond, or lake drainage feature designated in accordance
with the provisions of Part I of this article.
Section 15- 269.4 Diffuse Flow Requirement
Concentrated runoff from new ditches or man-made conveyances shall be converted to
diffuse flow at non-erosive velocities before the runoff enters the buffer, and maintained in the
buffer by dispersing runoff that has concentrated into rills, gullies, and ditches, and reestablishing
vegetation where concentrated flow has displaced vegetation Corrective action to restore diffuse
flow shall be taken if necessary to impede the formation or expansion of erosion rills or gullies.
Where site conditions constrain the ability to ensure diffuse flow through both Zones 1 and 2,
emphasis will be placed on ensuring diffuse flow through Zone 1, as provided for in 15-269.3.
No new engineered stormwater devices or conveyances are allowed in the buffers except as
provided for in Section 15-269.5.
Section 15-269.5 Exempt and Allowable Activities
(a) The table set forth in subsection (d) below sets out the activities and their
designation under this part as exempt, allowable, or allowable with mitigation, except as
provided for in 15-269.2. All activities not designated as exempt, allowable, or allowable

with mitigation are prohibited within the buffer unless a variance is granted pursuant to
Section 15-269.8.
(b) Activities designated in the table below as exempt, allowable, and allowable with
mitigation shall be subject to the following requirements. All activities shall be designed,
constructed and maintained to minimize soil and vegetation disturbance and to provide
the maximum water quality protection practicable, including construction, monitoring,
and maintenance activities. Activities designated in the table as allowable and allowable
with mitigation require written authorization from the Town.
(1) Exempt. Activities designated as exempt are allowed within the buffer. In
addition, exempt uses shall meet the requirements listed in the table and the
accompanying notes for the specific use.
(2) Allowable. Activities designated as allowable are permissible within the
buffer provided that there are no practical alternatives to the requested use as
determined in accordance with Section 15-269.6.
(3) Allowable With Mitigation. Activities designated as allowable with
mitigation are permissible within the buffer provided that there are no practical
alternatives to the requested use as determined in accordance with Section 15-
269.6, and an appropriate mitigation strategy has been approved pursuant to
Section 15-269.7.
(c) For public utilities as defined in this Article, the activities and their designation as
set forth in the table in subsection (d) apply to expansions and extensions. The

water quality buffer protection in relation to either a use shown in Section 15-269.5(d) as
“allowable with mitigation” or a use for which a variance has been granted pursuant to
Section 15-92(j).
(b) THE AREA OF MITIGATION. Staff shall determine the required area of mitigation,
which shall apply to all mitigation options identified in this section, according to the
following:
(1) The impacts in square feet to each zone of the buffer shall be determined by adding the
area of the footprint of the activity causing the impact to the riparian buffer, including
any clearing and grading within the buffer necessary to accommodate other activities,
and the area of any ongoing maintenance corridors within the buffer associated with
the activity.
(2) The required area of mitigation shall be determined by applying the following
multipliers to the impacts determined in subsection (b)(1) to each zone of the riparian
buffer:
a. Impacts to Zone one of the riparian buffer shall be multiplied by three;
b. Impacts to Zone two of the riparian buffer shall be multiplied by one and onehalf.
(c) THE LOCATION OF MITIGATION. The mitigation effort shall be located within the
Town’s planning jurisdiction, and as close to the location of the impact as feasible.

(d) OPTIONS FOR MEETING THE MITIGATION DETERMINATION. (AMENDED
5/22/12)
(1) For impacts to buffers on intermittent and perennial streams, payment of a
compensatory
mitigation fee to the Riparian Buffer Restoration Fund (pursuant to 15A NCAC 02B
.0269, Jordan Water Supply Nutrient Strategy: Riparian Mitigation Fees to the NC
Ecosystem Enhancement Program), contingent upon acceptance of payments by the NC
Ecosystem Enhancement Program, or to a private mitigation bank so long as the
mitigation programs alternative to the Riparian Buffer Restoration Fund comply with the
most current banking requirements of the US Army Corps of Engineers and the most
current applicable trading criteria associated with water quality mitigation. For impacts to
ephemeral streams, payment may be made only to the Town’s Water Quality
Enhancement Fund.
(2) Donation of real property or of an interest in real property pursuant to subsection (f)
of this Section;
(3) Riparian buffer enhancement, or riparian buffer restoration. This shall be
accomplished by the applicant after submittal and approval of a restoration plan
pursuant to subsection (g) of this Section.
(e) PAYMENT TO THE WATER QUALITY ENHANCEMENT FUND. Persons who choose
to satisfy their mitigation determination by paying a compensatory mitigation fee to the
Water Quality Enhancement Fund as allowed here shall use the following procedure:
(1) The Town shall establish annually, and include on the Miscellaneous Fees and Charges
Schedule, a per square foot buffer mitigation fee. The fee shall be based upon a
reasonable estimate of the per square foot cost of accomplishing riparian buffer
restoration.
(2) The amount of the compensatory mitigation fee due shall be determined by multiplying
the area in square feet of mitigation calculated in accordance with subsection (b) by the
per square foot buffer mitigation fee.
(3) The required fee shall be submitted to the Town prior to construction plan approval.
(f) DONATION OF PROPERTY. Persons who choose to satisfy their mitigation
determination by donating real property or an interest in real property to the Town shall
meet the following requirements:
(1) The donation of real property interests may be used to either partially or fully satisfy
the payment of a compensatory mitigation fee to the Riparian Buffer Restoration
Fund, the Water Quality Enhancement Fund, or another alternative, private mitigation
bank. The value of the property interest shall be determined by an appraisal
performed in accordance with subsection (f)(4)d of this Section. The donation shall
satisfy the mitigation determination if the appraised value of the donated property
interest is equal to or greater than the required fee. If the appraised value of the
donated property interest is less than the required fee, the applicant shall pay the
remaining balance due.
Art. XVI. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AND WATERSHED
PROTECTION

horizontally on a line perpendicular to the surface water.
d. The size of the restorable riparian buffer on the property to be donated shall equal
or exceed the acreage of riparian buffer required to be mitigated under the
mitigation responsibility determined pursuant to Item (b) of this Section.
e. The property shall not require excessive measures for successful restoration, such
as removal of structures or infrastructure. Restoration of the property shall be
capable of fully offsetting the adverse impacts of the requested use.
f. The property shall be suitable to be successfully restored, based on
existing hydrology, soils, and vegetation.
g. The estimated cost of restoring and maintaining the property shall not
exceed the value of the property minus site identification and land
acquisition costs.

Art. XVI. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION, STORMWATER MANAGEMENT, AND WATERSHED
PROTECTION
Page #65
(5) Within one year after the permit issuing authority has approved the restoration or
enhancement plan, the applicant shall present proof that the riparian buffer has been
restored or enhanced. If proof is not presented within this timeframe, then the person
shall be in violation of the riparian buffer protection program.
(6) The mitigation area shall be placed under a perpetual conservation easement that will
provide for protection of the property’s nutrient removal and other water quality
enhancement functions.
(7) The applicant shall submit annual reports for a period of five years after the
restoration or enhancement showing that the trees planted have survived and that
diffuse flow through the riparian buffer has been maintained. The applicant shall
replace trees that do not survive and restore diffuse flow if needed during that fiveyear
period.
(h) The Town may determine that the option described in 15-269.7(e) does not apply to a
public utility as defined in this Article if the mitigation options specified above in 15-
269.7(f) and (g) are found to not be feasible.
Section 269.8 Permits and Enforcement of Buffer Requirements.
Like the other requirements of this chapter, the provisions of Part III of Article XVI
(water quality buffers) shall ordinarily be enforced by requiring compliance as development
permits (i.e., zoning, special use, or conditional use permits) are issued. Accordingly, a
determination as to whether a proposed disturbance of a buffer is exempt, allowable, or allowable
with mitigation will ordinarily be made in the context of the review process for such a
development permit. To the extent that the activities identified in the Table of Exempt and
Allowable Activities (set forth in Subsection 15-269.5(d) above) are proposed to be conducted or
undertaken under circumstances where no such development permit is likely to be required (e.g.,
archeological activities or the installation of playground equipment), such activities may not be
conducted or undertaken until a buffer disturbance permit has been issued by the zoning
administrator. Such permit shall be issued if the administrator concludes, based upon the
information submitted with the application for such permit, that the proposed disturbance will be
consistent with the requirements of this article.

ARTICLE XVII
SIGNS
Section 15-270 Definitions.
Unless otherwise specifically provided, or unless clearly required by the context, the words
and phrases defined in this section shall have the meaning indicated when used in this article.
(1) SIGN. Any device that (i) is sufficiently visible to persons not located on the lot
where such device is located to accomplish either of the objectives set forth in
subdivision (ii) of this definition, and (ii) is designed to attract the attention of such
persons or to communicate information to them. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, a device that might otherwise be categorized as a sign that is located
at least fifteen feet to the interior side of any exterior wall shall not be regarded as a
sign so long as it is not internally illuminated, illuminated with spotlights, or
otherwise illuminated to draw special attention to it. (AMENDED 3/11/86)
(2) FREESTANDING SIGN. A sign that (i) is not directly attached to, erected on, or
supported by a building or other structure having a principal function other than the
support of such sign, but (ii) is instead attached to, erected on, or supported by some
structure (such as a pole, mast, frame, or other structure) that is not itself an integral
part of a building or other structure having a principal function other than the
support of a sign. A sign that stands without supporting elements, such as
“sandwich sign”, is also a freestanding sign.
(3) OFF-PREMISES SIGNS. A sign that draws attention to or communicates information
about a business, service, commodity, accommodation, attraction, or other activity
that is conducted, sold, or offered at a location other than the premises on which the
sign is located.
(4) SANDWICH BOARD SIGN. A freestanding sign consisting of two panels joined
together at the top and configured in the shape of an inverted “V” (?) so that the
bottom of the sign rests upon or near the ground. (AMENDED 12/08/92)
(5) TEMPORARY SIGN. A sign that (i) is used in connection with a circumstance,
situation, or event that is designed, intended or expected to take place or to be
completed within a reasonably short or definite period after the erection of such
sign, or (ii) is intended to remain on the location where it is erected or placed for a
period of not more than fifteen days. If a sign display area is permanent but the
message displayed is subject to periodic changes, that sign shall not be regarded as
temporary.

Section 15-271 Permit Required for Signs (AMENDED 1/22/85)
(a) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 15-272 (Signs Excluded From Regulation)
and 15-273 (Certain Temporary Signs: Permit Exceptions and Additional Regulations), no sign
may be erected, moved, enlarged, or substantially altered except in accordance with the provisions
of this section.
(b) If plans submitted for a zoning permit, special use permit, or conditional use permit
include sign plans in sufficient detail that the permit-issuing authority can determine whether the
proposed sign or signs comply with the provisions of this chapter, then issuance of the requested
zoning, special use, or conditional use permit shall constitute approval of the proposed sign or
signs.
(c) Signs not approved as provided in subsection (b) or (d) exempted under the
provisions referenced in subsection (a) may be erected, moved, enlarged, or substantially altered
only in accordance with a sign permit issued by the administrator. (AMENDED 6/26/12)
(1) Sign permit applications and sign permits shall be governed by the same
provisions of this chapter applicable to zoning permits.
(2) In the case of a lot occupied or intended to be occupied by multiple business
enterprises (e.g., a shopping center): (AMENDED 3/4/86)
a. Subject to Subsection 15-271(b), sign permits shall be issued in the
name of the lot owner or his agent rather than in the name of the
individual business, and it shall be the sole responsibility of such
owner or agent to allocate among the tenants the permissible
maximum sign surface area.
b. Upon application by such owner or agent, the administration may
issue a master sign permit that allocates permissible sign surface area
to the various buildings or businesses within the development
according to an agreed upon formula and thereafter sign permits may
be issued to individual tenants only in accordance with the allocation
contained in the master sign permit.
(d) In the B-1(C) and B-1(G) zoning districts, with respect to developments that (i)
require the issuance of a conditional use permit, (ii) are intended to be occupied by multiple
commercial enterprises, and (iii) will contain one or more buildings that are at least three stories
in height, the Board of Aldermen may approve a master signage plan that shows in detail the
dimensions, locations, and characteristics of all signs within that development other than those
signs that are excluded from regulation under Section 15-272 or that do not require permits under
Section 15-273. (AMENDED 6/26/12)
Art. XVII SIGNS
Page #3
(1) Such master signage plan may be approved as part of the issuance of the
original conditional use permit or as a minor amendment to the original conditional use
permit, provided that no such master plan shall be approved through the minor
amendment process unless the Board of Aldermen first holds a public hearing on the
proposed amendment. Amendments to a master signage plan approved under this section
may be approved in accordance with the provisions of Section 15-64 (Amendments to
and Modifications of Permits).
(2) In approving a master signage plan as authorized by this subsection, the Board
may allow deviations from the requirements of this chapter relating to the number and
type of permissible signs as well as other dimensional restrictions applicable to such signs
if the Board concludes that such deviations are warranted given the height, shape,
dimensions, and orientation of buildings on the development site, the number of
individual businesses likely to occupy the development site, the need of the traveling
public to be able conveniently and safely to locate and access destination businesses (e.g.
hotels and restaurants) and parking areas.
(3) In approving a master signage plan as authorized by this subsection, the Board
may also authorize the construction of one or more off-premises signs that direct
motorists to the location of parking for a Carrboro hotel or motel, so long as such signs
are located in a commercial zoning district on private property with the consent of the
property owner. (AMENDED 1/29/13)
(e) Signs for home occupations and major home occupations shall be permitted
subject to the following provisions (AMENDED10/22/19):
(1) A lot that houses a legally-established home-based occupation as an
accessory use may have up to one wall-mounted sign with a maximum area of 4 square
feet. In the HR-R district, legally-established major home occupations may have up to one
wall-mounted sign with a maximum area of 8 square feet.
(2) Signs must be non-illuminated.
(3) Signs shall comply with the standards of Sections 15-271, Permit Required
for Signs, 15-275, Computation of Sign Area, and 15-282, Miscellaneous Requirements.
Section 15-272 Signs Excluded From Regulation.
The following signs are exempt from regulation under this chapter except for those stated in
Subsection 15-282(b) through (e).
(1) Signs not exceeding four square feet in area that are customarily associated with
residential use and that are not of a commercial nature, such as signs giving property
identification names or numbers or names of occupants, signs on mailboxes or paper

tubes, and signs posted on private property relating to private parking or warning the
public against trespassing or danger from animals.
(2) Signs erected by or on behalf of or pursuant to the authorization of a governmental
body, including legal notices, identification and informational signs, and traffic,
directional or regulatory signs.
(3) Official signs of a noncommercial nature erected by public utilities.
(4) Flags, pennants, or insignia of any governmental or nonprofit organization when not
displayed in connection with a commercial promotion; provided that such flags,
pennants, or insignia may be displayed within a public right-of-way only when
authorized by a resolution adopted by the Board of Aldermen. (AMENDED
05/09/89)
(5) Integral decorative or architectural features of buildings or works of art, so long as
such features or works do not contain letters, trademarks, moving parts, or lights.
(6) Signs directing and guiding traffic on private property that do not exceed four square
feet each and that bear no advertising matter.
(7) Bulletin boards, identification signs, and church directional signs that do not exceed
one per abutting street and sixteen square feet in area and that are not internally
illuminated. (AMENDED 01/22/2019)
(8) Signs painted on or otherwise permanently attached to currently licensed motor
vehicles that are not primarily used as signs.
(9) Signs proclaiming religious, political, or other non- commercial messages [other
than those regulated by Subdivision 15-273(a)(5)] that do not exceed one per
abutting street and sixteen square feet in area and that are not internally illuminated.
(AMENDED 1/22/85)
(10) Signs attached to the interior of a building window or glass door, or visible through
such window or door, so long as such signs, individually or collectively, do not
cover more than thirty percent (30%) of the surface area of the transparent portion of
such window or door. (AMENDED 3/11/86)
a. For purposes of determining whether a sign not attached to the interior of a
window or door but visible by looking through such window or door
complies with this subdivision, the area of such sign shall be computed in
accordance with Section 15-275 and the sign shall be deemed to “cover” an
equivalent amount of the surface area of the window or glass door through
which it is visible.
Art. XVII SIGNS
Page #5
b. If a sign located inside a building is visible through glass doors or windows
on more than one side of a building, then the relevant windows or doors for
purposes of this subdivision are those facing the street toward which the sign
has its primary orientation.
c. Notwithstanding the foregoing, signs attached to the interior of a building
window or glass door or visible through such window or door that are
internally illuminated or externally illuminated by spotlighting or other
illuminating technique designed to draw particular attention to them shall
not be exempt from regulations.
d. Signs that do not exceed four square feet and that advertise an event or
activity sponsored by a nonprofit enterprise shall not be included in
determining compliance with the thirty percent (30%) surface are coverage
limitation set forth above, so long as such signs are removed after the event
or activity has occurred.
(11) Displays of merchandise offered for sale or rent on the premises where displayed.
Only merchandise of the type that is actually for sale or rent, and not pictorial or
other representations of such merchandise, falls within this exemption.
(12) Signs posted near structural BMPs to comply with Subsection 15-263.1(h) that do
not exceed four square feet. (AMENDED 6/26/12)
Section 15-273 Certain Temporary Signs: Permit Exemptions and Additional Regulations
(a) The following temporary signs are permitted without a zoning, special use,
conditional use, or sign permit. However, such signs shall conform to the requirements set forth
below as well as all other applicable requirements of this chapter except those contained in Section
15-276 (Total Sign Surface Area) and 15-278 (Number of Freestanding Signs).
(1) Signs containing the message that the real estate on which the sign is located
(including buildings) is for sale, lease, or rent, together with information
identifying the owner or agent. Such signs may not exceed four square feet
in area and shall be removed immediately after sale, lease, or rental. For lots
of less than five acres, a single sign on each street frontage may be erected.
For lots of five acres or more in area and having a street frontage in excess
of four hundred feet, a second sign not exceeding four square feet in area
may be erected.
(2) Construction site identification signs. Such signs may identify the project,
the owner or developer, architect, engineer, contractor and subcontractors,
funding sources, and may contain related information. (i) Not more than one
such sign may be erected per site, and it may not exceed thirty-two square
Art. XVII SIGNS
Page #6
feet in area. Such signs shall be erected prior to the issuance of a building
permit and shall be removed within ten days after the issuance of the final
occupancy permit. (ii) In addition, fence wraps displaying signage when
affixed to perimeter fencing at a construction site are exempt until a
certificate of occupancy is issued for the final portion of any construction at
a site, or 24 months from the time the fence wrap is installed, whichever is
shorter. If the construction is not completed at the end of 24 months from
the time the fence wrap was installed, the Town may regulate the signage
but shall allow fence wrapping material to remain affixed to the perimeter
fencing. Fence wrapping shall not impede the view from sight distance
triangles. (AMENDED 03/28/17)
(3) Signs indicating that, on the lot where the sign is located, a new business is
opening, a previously existing business is going out of business, a one- time
auction is planned, or some other non- recurring activity of a similar nature
is scheduled. Signs referring to sales or other events designed to promote a
pre-existing, ongoing business or commercial venture or any specific
product or service offered by such business or commercial venture are not
authorized under this subsection. Signs authorized under this subsection
may be erected or displayed not sooner than two weeks before the activity
that is advertised and must be removed not later than three weeks after they
are first erected or displayed. (REPEALED 3/11/86; AMENDED
12/03/91)
(4) Displays, including lighting, erected in connection with the observance of
holidays. Such signs shall be removed within ten days following the
holidays.
(5) Signs erected in connection with elections or political campaigns. Such
signs shall be removed within three days following the election or
conclusion of the campaign. No such sign may exceed sixteen square feet in
area. Such signs may not be attached to any natural or man-made permanent
structure located within a public right-of-way, including without limitation
trees, utility poles, or traffic control signs. (AMENDED 08/25/83);
08/25/92)
(6) Signs indicating that a special event such as a fair, carnival, circus, festival
or similar happening is to take place on the lot where the sign is located.
Such signs may be erected not sooner than two weeks before the event and
must be removed not later than three days after the event.
(7) Temporary signs not covered in the foregoing categories, so long as such
signs meet the following restrictions:
a. Not more than one such sign may be located on any lot.
Art. XVII SIGNS
Page #7
b. No such sign may exceed four square feet in surface area.
c. Such sign may not be displayed for longer than three consecutive
days nor more than ten days out of any 365-day period.
(b) Other temporary signs not listed in subsection (a) shall be regarded and treated in all
respects as permanent signs, except that (as provided in Section 15-276) temporary signs shall not
be included in calculating the total amount of permitted sign area.
Section 15-274 Determining the Number of Signs.
(a) For the purpose of determining the number of signs, a sign shall be considered to be
a single display surface or display device containing elements organized, related, and composed to
form a unit. Where matter is displayed in a random manner without organized relationship of
elements, each element shall be considered a single sign.
(b) Without limiting the generality of subsection (a), a multi-sided sign shall be
regarded as one sign.
Section 15-275 Computation of Sign Area.
(a) The surface area of a sign shall be computed by including the entire area within a
single, continuous, rectilinear perimeter of not more than eight straight lines, or a circle or an
ellipse, enclosing the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem or other display,
together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display used to
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any
supporting framework or bracing that is clearly incidental to the display itself.
(b) If the sign consists of more than one section or module, all of the area, including that
between sections or modules, shall be included in the computation of the sign area.
(c) Except as provided in subsection (d), the sign surface area of two-sided, multi-sided,
or three dimensional signs shall be computed by including the total of all sides designed either to
attract attention or communicate information. This means that, with respect to the typical two-sided
sign, where the message is printed on both sides of a flat surface and the sign is erected
perpendicular to the street, the sign surface area will equal twice the area of a single side of the sign
(i.e., twice the area determined by multiplying the dimensions--length times width--of the sign
panel). (AMENDED 3/12/85)
(d) With respect to signs covered under Sections 15-272, 15-273, and 15-276(b), the
sign surface area of two-sided, multi-sided, and three dimensional signs shall be computed by
including the total of all sides designed to attract attention or communicate information that can be
seen at one time by a person from any vantage point. Thus, for example, signs directing traffic on
private property are exempt from regulation so long as such signs do not exceed four square feet
Art. XVII SIGNS
Page #8
[Subsection 15-262(6)]. A back-to-back sign having dimensions of two feet by two feet would
qualify for this exemption. (AMENDED 3/12/85)
(e) The sign surface area of any sign located on the wall of a structure where the closest
element of the sign is at least 60 feet from the street centerline shall be computed by multiplying the
true sign surface area [Section 15-275(a)] by 0.5. (AMENDED 3/12/85)
Section 15-276 Total Sign Surface Area.
(a) Unless otherwise provided in this article, the total surface area devoted to all signs
on any lot shall not exceed the limitations set forth in this section, and all signs except temporary
signs shall be included in this calculation.
(b) Unless otherwise provided in this article or in Article XI (Supplementary Use
Regulations), the maximum sign surface area permitted on any lot in an R-2, R-3, R-7.5, R-10,
R-15, R-20, R-R, or R-S.I.R. district is four square feet. (AMENDED 2/4/86)
(c) Subject to the other provisions of this section, the maximum sign surface area
permitted on any lot in a commercial or manufacturing district as set out in Section 15-136 or
15-137 shall be determined as follows: (AMENDED 2/4/86)
(1) There may be not more than 0.5 square feet of sign surface area per linear
foot of street frontage up to 200 feet of frontage.
(2) There may be up to 0.75 square feet of additional sign surface area per linear
foot of lot frontage in excess of 200 feet.
(d) If a lot has frontage on more than one street, then the total sign surface area
permitted on that lot shall be the sum of the sign surface area allotments related to each street [as
determined in accordance with subsection (c)] on which the lot has frontage. However, the total
sign surface area that is oriented toward a particular street may not exceed the portion of the lot's
total sign surface area allocation that is derived from frontage on that street. (AMENDED 4/ /82)
(e) Whenever a lot is situated such that it has no street frontage on any lot boundary and
an applicant desires to install on such a lot a sign that is oriented toward a street, then the total sign
surface area permitted on that lot shall be the sign surface area that would be allowed [as
determined in accordance with subsection (c) and Section 15-275 subsection (d)], if the lot
boundary closest to the street toward which such sign is to be oriented fronted on such street. The
applicant shall be restricted to using only one street and the closest lot boundary to this street for
determining the total permitted sign surface area. However, the applicant shall be given the
opportunity to determine the one street used in the calculations and toward which this sign will also
be oriented.
(f) The sign surface area of any sign located on a wall of a structure may not exceed
50% of the total surface area of the wall on which the sign is located.
Art. XVII SIGNS
Page #9
(g) Whenever a tract located within a B-4 zoning district is subdivided, then, subject to
the following requirements, the subdivider may allocate among the lots so created the total sign
surface area that would be allowed under this section on the tract prior to subdivision.
(AMENDED 3/4/86)
(1) Information concerning the exact nature of the sign surface area allocation
must either be indicated on the face of a recorded plat of the subdivided tract
or included in a separately recorded document, which document must be
referenced on the recorded plat in a manner that indicates the general nature
of such document and specifies the book and page number where such
recorded document can be located in the Orange County Registry.
(2) Sign surface area allocation may be shifted only from a lot bordering a street
to another lot bordering the same street.
(3) No sign allocation may be made affecting (by adding sign surface area to or
subtracting sign area from) any lot after such lot has been conveyed by the
subdivider.
(4) Once a sign allocation has been made in accordance with this section, the
allocation so made shall control the amount of total sign surface area
permissible on any lot affected, regardless of the street frontage of such lot.
(5) An allocation under this section shall not affect the provisions of Section
15-277, which will continue to govern the determination of the maximum
area of a freestanding sign on any subdivided lot.
Section 15-277 Freestanding Sign Surface Area.
(a) For purposes of this section, a side of a freestanding sign is any plane or flat surface
included in the calculation of the total sign surface area as provided in Section 15-275. For
example, wall signs typically have one side. Freestanding signs typically have two sides (back to
back), although four-sided and other multi-sided signs are also common.
(b) A single side of a freestanding sign may not exceed 0.3 square feet in surface area
for every linear foot of street frontage along the street toward which such sign is primarily oriented.
However, in no case may a single side of a freestanding sign exceed 50 square feet in surface area if
the lot on which the sign is located has less than 200 feet of frontage on the street toward which that
sign is primarily oriented, 75 square feet on lots with 200 or more but less than 400 feet of frontage,
and 100 square feet on lots with 400 or more feet of frontage.
(c) With respect to freestanding signs that have no discernible “sides”, such as spheres
or other shapes not composed of flat planes, no such freestanding sign may exceed 0.3 square feet
Art. XVII SIGNS
Page #10
in total surface area for every linear foot of street frontage along the street toward which such sign
is primarily oriented. However, in no case may such sign exceed 100 square feet in surface area.
Section 15-278 Number of Freestanding Signs.
(a) Except as authorized by this section and Section 15-283, no development may have
more than one freestanding sign. (AMENDED 12/08/92)
(b) If a development is located on a corner lot that has at least 400 feet of frontage on
each of the two intersecting public streets, then the development may have not more than one
freestanding sign along each side of the development bordered by such streets.
(c) If a development is located on a lot that is bordered by two public streets that do not
intersect at the lot's boundaries (double front lot), then the development may have not more than
one freestanding sign on each side of the development bordered by such streets.
(d) If a corner lot contains a building, then a freestanding sign may be located along
each of the intersecting streets that abut such lot if the freestanding signs are located such that,
when a person is standing next to one such sign, the building on that lot totally obscures the view of
the other freestanding sign. (AMENDED 12/03/91)
Section 15-279 Subdivision and Multi-Family Development Entrance Signs.
At any entrance to a subdivision or multi-family development, there may be not more than
two signs identifying such subdivision or development. A single side of any such sign may not
exceed sixteen square feet, nor may the total surface area of all such signs exceed thirty-two square
feet.
Section 15-280 Location and Height Requirements.
(a) Freestanding signs other than sandwich board signs shall observe the setback
requirements set forth in Section 15-184. (AMENDED 12/08/92)
(b) No sign may extend above any parapet or be placed upon any roof surface, except
that for purpose of this section, roof surfaces constructed at an angle of 75 degrees or more from
horizontal shall be regarded as wall space. This subsection shall not apply to displays, including
lighting, erected in connection with the observation of holidays on the roofs of residential
structures.
(c) No sign attached to a building may project more than forty-two inches from the
building wall. Any sign that is attached to a building wall and that projects more than twelve inches
from the building wall shall not exceed twelve square feet (generally, six square feet per sign face,
see section 15-275) and shall be constructed so that the lowest part of the sign is at least eight feet
above ground level and the highest part is not more than fifteen feet above ground level.
(AMENDED 08/25/92)
Art. XVII SIGNS
Page #11
(d) No sign or supporting structure may be located in or over the traveled portion of any
public right-of-way unless the sign is attached to a structural element of a building and an
encroachment permit has been obtained from the town (and from the state, if necessary).
(e) No part of a freestanding sign may exceed a height of fifteen feet, measured from
ground level.
Section 15-281 Sign Illumination and Signs Containing Lights.
(a) Unless otherwise prohibited by this chapter, signs may be illuminated if such
illumination is in accordance with this section.
(b) No sign within 150 feet of a residential zone may be illuminated between the hours
of 12 midnight and 6:00 a.m., unless the impact of such lighting beyond the boundaries of the lot
where it is located is entirely inconsequential. Freestanding signs located in residential districts
may not be internally lit. (AMENDED 11/26/85)
(c) Lighting directed toward a sign shall be shielded so that it illuminates only the face
of the sign and does not shine directly into a public right-of-way or residential premises.
(d) Internally illuminated freestanding signs may not be illuminated during hours that
the business or enterprise advertised by such sign is not open for business or in operation.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance, existing situations that violate the provisions
of this subsection shall not be regarded as lawful, nonconforming situations.
(e) Subject to subsection (g), illuminated tubings or strings of lights that outline
property lines, sales areas, roof lines, doors, windows, or similar areas are prohibited.
(f) Subject to subsection (g), no sign may contain or be illuminated by flashing or
intermittent lights or lights of changing degrees of intensity, except signs indicating the time, date
or weather conditions.
(g) Subsections (e) and (f) do not apply to temporary signs erected in connection with
observance of holidays.
Section 15-282 Miscellaneous Requirements.
(a) “As provided in the Table of Permissible Uses, off-premises signs may only be
located in the M-2 district, except that, within a commercial zoning district, off-premises signs
directing motorists to the location of Carrboro hotel parking may be approved in accordance with
the provisions of Subsection 15-271(d)(3).” (AMENDED 1/29/13)
Art. XVII SIGNS
Page #12
(b) No sign may be located so that it substantially interferes with the view necessary for
motorists to proceed safely through intersections or to enter onto or exit from public streets or
private roads.
(c) Signs that revolve or are animated or that utilize movement or apparent movement
to attract the attention of the public are prohibited. Without limiting the foregoing, banners,
streamers, animated display boards, pennants, and propellers are prohibited, but signs that only
move occasionally because of wind are not prohibited, if their movement (i) is not a primary design
feature of the sign, and (ii) is not intended to attract attention to the sign. The restriction of this
subsection shall not apply to signs specified in subdivision 15-272(4) or to signs indicating the
time, date, or weather conditions.
(d) No sign may be erected so that by its location, color, size, shape, nature or message
it would tend to obstruct the view of or be confused with official traffic signs or other signs erected
by governmental agencies.
(e) Freestanding signs shall be securely fastened to the ground or to some other
substantial supportive structure so that there is virtually no danger that either the sign or the
supportive structure may be moved by the wind or other forces of nature and cause injury to persons
or property.
Section 15-283 Sandwich Board Signs (AMENDED 12/08/92)
(a) Sandwich board signs shall be allowed subject to the provisions of this section to the
extent that any other provision of this article is inconsistent with this section, the provisions of this
section shall be controlling.
(b) Any business or commercial or noncommercial entity that has a place of business or
occupancy on a lot within a B-1(c), B-1(g), B-2, or CT zoning district may place not more than one
sandwich board sign on the lot where such business or other entity is located. If such business or
other entity is not located on a lot that has street frontage, then it may (with the permission of the lot
owner) place a sandwich board sign on the closest lot that has street frontage.
(c) Each single side of a sandwich board sign may not exceed six square feet and may
not exceed a height of three feet, measured from ground level. The sign surface area authorized
herein shall be in addition to the sign surface area otherwise allowable under this article.
(d) A sandwich board sign shall be of sufficiently solid construction and weight that it
will not be blown over in winds of less than forty miles per hour.
(e) Sandwich board signs need not observe the setback requirements set forth in Section
15-184. However, such signs may not be located within the traveled portion of any street or
sidewalk or in any other place or manner that would tend to obstruct the free movement of vehicles
or pedestrians or block the view of motorists at street intersections or driveway entrances.
Art. XVII SIGNS
Page #13
(f) Sandwich board signs may not be internally or externally lighted.
(g) Sandwich board signs shall be stored within a completely enclosed building
whenever the enterprise advertised by such sign is not open for business.
(h) Sandwich board signs authorized under this subsection must contain a permanently
affixed message (i.e., one that does not change daily, weekly, or monthly).

ARTICLE XVIII
PARKING
Section 15-290 Definitions.
Unless otherwise specifically provided or unless clearly required by the context, the words
and phrases defined below shall have the meaning indicated when used in this section.
(1) CIRCULATION AREA. That portion of the vehicle accommodation area used for
access to parking or loading areas or other facilities on the lot. Essentially,
driveways and other maneuvering areas (other than parking aisles) comprise the
circulation area.
(2) DRIVEWAY. That portion of the vehicle accommodation area that consists of a
travel lane bounded on either side by an area that is not part of the vehicle
accommodation area.
(3) GROSS FLOOR AREA. The total area of a building measured by taking the outside
dimensions of the building at each floor level intended for occupancy or storage.
(4) LOADING AND UNLOADING AREA. That portion of the vehicle accommodation area
used to satisfy the requirements of Section 15-300.
(5) PARKING AREA AISLES. That portion of the vehicle accommodation area
consisting of lanes providing access to parking spaces. (AMENDED 2/4/86)
(6) PARKING SPACE. A portion of the vehicle accommodation area set for the parking
of one vehicle.
(7) VEHICLE ACCOMMODATION AREA. That portion of a lot that is used by vehicles
for access, circulation, parking and loading and unloading. It comprises the total of
circulation areas, loading and unloading areas, and parking areas.
(8) VEHICLE STORAGE AREA. That portion of a vehicle accommodation area used in
connection with a 9.200 or 9.400 classification use as a place to park vehicles
temporarily while they are waiting to be worked on or pending the pick-up of such
vehicles by their owners.
Section 15-291 Number of Parking Spaces Required.
(a) Subject to Section 15-292.1, all developments shall provide a sufficient number of
parking spaces to accommodate the number of vehicles that ordinarily are likely to be attracted to
the development in question. In addition, all 9.200 and 9.400 classification uses shall provide
sufficient vehicle storage area to accommodate the number of vehicles likely to be on the premises
awaiting work or pending removal of their owners. (AMENDED 2/4/86; 5/18/04)
(b) The presumptions established by this article are that: (i) a development must comply
with the parking standards set forth in subsection (g) to satisfy the requirement stated in subsection
(a), and (ii) any development that does meet these standards is in compliance. However, the Table
of Parking Standards is only intended to establish a presumption and should be flexibly
administered, as provided in Section 15-292.
Art. XVIII PARKING
Page #2
(c) Uses in the Table of Parking Requirements [subsection (g)], are indicated by a
numerical reference keyed to the Table of Permissible Uses, Section 15-146. When determination
of the number of parking spaces required by this table results in a requirement of a fractional space,
any fraction of one-half or less may be disregarded, while a fraction in excess of one-half shall be
counted as one parking space.
(d) With respect to any parking lot that is required to be paved (see Section 15-296):
(AMENDED 9/13/83)
(1) The number of parking spaces required by this article may be reduced by a
total of one space if the developer provides a bikerack or similar device that
offers a secure parking area for at least five bicycles.
(2) In non-residential districts, the number of parking spaces required by this
article may be reduced by one space for each motorcycle pad provided, up to
a total of five percent of the required number of spaces.
(e) Whenever a building is constructed with the intention that it be used in whole or in
part for use classification 2.120, 2.220, 2.320, 3.120, or 3.220, the building shall be constructed on
the lot in such a manner that sufficient usable space remains on the lot to add the additional parking
spaces that would be required to convert the use of the building entirely to use classification 2.110,
2.210, 2.310, 3.110, or 3.210. In addition, whenever a developer proposes to construct a building to
be used for purposes that require a lesser number of parking spaces than other uses to which the
building might well be put at some future date, the administrator shall send to the developer a
certified letter explaining that sufficient space should be left on the lot to add parking spaces at a
later time if required. (AMENDED 2/4/86)
(f) The Board recognizes that the Table of Parking Requirements set forth in subsection
(g) cannot and does not cover every possible situation that may arise. Therefore, in cases not
specifically covered, the permit-issuing authority is authorized to determine the parking
requirements using this table as a guide. In addition, the Board of Aldermen may authorize a
reduction of up to 25 percent in the parking requirement when approving a Village Mixed Use
Master Plan or Conditional Use Permit or an Office/Assembly development Conditional Use
Permit. Land necessary to meet the full, presumptive, parking requirement must be identified
during the plan approval process and must be reserved should the need for additional parking arise
in the future. (AMENDED 05/25/99)

by all developments that fall within the use classifications shown in the following Table
of Bicycle Parking Standards.
When determination of the number of spaces required by this table results in a requirement
of a fractional space, any fraction of one-half or less shall be disregarded, while a
fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one space.

(AMENDED 6/19/12; 3/22/16)
Section 15-292 Flexibility in Administration Required (AMENDED 10/23/18)
(a) The Board recognizes that due to the particularities of any given development, the inflexible
application of the parking standards set forth in Subsection 15-291(g) may result in a development
either with inadequate parking space or parking space far in excess of its needs. The former situation
may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations in adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking
in nearby private lots. The latter situation results in a waste of money as well as a waste of space that
could more desirably be used for valuable development or environmentally useful open space.
Therefore, as suggested in Section 15-191, the permit-issuing authority may permit deviations from the
presumptive requirements of Subsection 15-291(g) and may require more parking or allow less parking
whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in subsection
15-291(a). In addition, that same flexible approach shall be followed with respect to the vehicle storage
area requirements set forth in the preceding table.
(a1) The Board also recognizes that due to the particularities of any given development,
the inflexible application of bicycle parking standards set forth in Subsection 15-
291(h) and 15-295.1 may result in a development either with inadequate parking space or
parking space in excess of its needs. Therefore, the permit-issuing authority may permit deviations
from the presumptive requirements of Subsection 15-291(h) and 15-295.1 may require
more or less bicycle parking subject to the criteria in Subsection 15-292(b1).
(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the permit-issuing authority may allow
deviations from the parking requirements set forth in Subsection 15-291(g) when it finds that:
(1) A residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly;
Art. XVIII PARKING
Page #9
(2) A residential development is located on a bus line, is located in close
proximity to the central business district, and is committed to a policy of
placing restrictions on the vehicle ownership of its tenants.
(3) A business is primarily oriented to walk-in trade.
(b1) The permit-issuing authority may allow deviations from the bicycle parking
requirements set forth in Subsection 15-291(h) when it finds at least one of the following:
(1) A residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly, and
or persons with disabilities; or
(2) A residential or commercial development is located on a lot, constrained
by size or topography, such that the installation of the presumptive number bicycle
parking spaces that comply with the Design Standards for Bicycle Parking in Section
15-295.1 is impracticable. In those cases, the development shall instead provide the
maximum number of bicycle parking spaces practicable.
(c) Whenever the permit-issuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the
presumptive parking requirements set forth in subsections 15-291(g), 15-291(h) and 15-295.1,
it shall enter on the face of the permit the parking requirement that it imposes and the reasons for
allowing or requiring the deviation.
(d) If the permit-issuing authority concludes, based upon information it receives in the
consideration of a specific development proposal, that the presumption established by subsections
15-291(g) and 15-291(h) for a particular use classification is erroneous, it shall initiate a
request for an amendment to the Table of Parking Requirements in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Article XX.
Section 15-292.1 Payment of Fee In Lieu of Providing Parking Spaces
(a) With respect to properties within the B-1(C), B-1(G), and B-2 districts that are developed
for commercial purposes, the permit issuing authority may authorize the developer to forego
the construction of parking spaces otherwise required on the developer’s property pursuant to
the provisions of Section 15-291 of this Article for commercial uses if (i) the permit issuing authority
finds that the parking needs of such development can be met by public parking facilities
that are located or expected to be constructed within a reasonable time within reasonable proximity
to the proposed development, and (ii) the developer pays to the town for each such space that
is not constructed a fee in lieu of providing that space in an amount determined as provided in
subsection (b) of this section. This fee shall be paid before an occupancy permit is issued to the
development, unless the permit issuing authority by condition establishes another time.
(b) The amount of the fee authorized by this section shall be determined by estimating
the cost of providing a paved parking space (including land and improvement costs) that meets
Art. XVIII PARKING
Page #10
the requirements of this Article. This determination shall be made annually and the fee shall be
included in the Miscellaneous Fees and Charges Schedule adopted by the Board of Aldermen.
(c) Any fees collected in accordance with this section shall be reserved and used exclusively
to meet the purposes for which they have been obtained as specified above in subsection
(a).
Section 15-293 Parking Space Dimensions (AMENDED 9/13/83)
(a) Subject to subsection (b) and (c), parking spaces shall contain a rectangular area at least
eight and one-half feet wide and eighteen feet long. Lines demarcating parking spaces may be drawn at
various angles in relation to curbs or aisles, as long as the parking spaces so created contain within
them the rectangular area required by this section. (AMENDED 2/5/08)
(b) In parking areas containing ten or more spaces, up to 40% of the parking spaces
may be set aside for the exclusive use of compact cars, provided the compact car area is designated
for exclusive use by compact cars, and that adequate signs are provided designating and
informing the public of the exclusive use. A compact parking space shall contain a rectangular
area eight feet wide and fifteen feet long. (AMENDED 4/24/12)
(c) Wherever parking consists of spaces set aside for parallel parking, one foot shall be
added to the minimum required width, and three feet to the minimum required length.
(d) Motorcycle pads shall contain a rectangular area at least four feet wide and eight feet
long. Spaces shall be located at either end of parking aisles and shall have, centered, a concrete or
metal strip one square foot in area to accommodate the use of kick stands.
Section 15-294 Required Width of Parking Area Aisles (AMENDED 5/18/04)
(a) Subject to subsections (b) and (c) parking area aisles shall have a minimum width
between parking spaces as follows: (AMENDED 6/26/84)
STANDARD, OR NON-SUBCOMPACT AREA
PARKING ANGLE
AISLE TYPE 0? 45? 60? 90?
ONE WAY 13 13 18 24
TWO WAY 19 21 23 24
Art. XVIII PARKING
Page #11
(b) In parking areas where subcompact spaces are provided pursuant to 15-293(b) of this
ordinance, parking aisle spaces adjoining subcompact spaces shall have a minimum width between
such parking spaces as follows:
STANDARD AREA PARKING ANGLE
AISLE TYPE 0? 45? 60? 90?
ONE WAY 13 13 14 20
TWO WAY 19 21 23 24
(c) The width of a parking aisle serving 90o angle parking may be reduced to eighteen feet if (i)
not more than ten spaces are to be served by an aisle with such reduced width, and (ii) the
aisle “dead ends”, i.e., is not used as an access way to other areas. (AMENDED 6/26/84)
(d) Driveways shall be not less than ten feet in width for one way traffic and eighteen feet in
width for two way traffic, except that ten foot wide driveways are permissible for two way
traffic when (i) the driveway is not longer than fifty feet, (ii) it provides access to not more
than ten spaces, and (iii) sufficient turning space is provided so that vehicles need not back
into a public street. (AMENDED 6/26/84)
(e) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, the permit issuing authority may
allow the use of geometric standards other that those specified in this section if the
permit issuing authority finds that (i) the plans for the vehicle accommodation area
are sealed by a registered engineer with recognized expertise in parking facility design,
and (ii) the alternative design will satisfy off-street parking requirements as adequately
as would a facility using the specifications set forth in this section and would
otherwise be consistent with public safety.
Section 15-295 General Design Requirements (AMENDED 5/18/04)
(a) Vehicle accommodation areas shall be designed so that, without resorting to
extraordinary movements, vehicles may exit such areas without backing onto a public street. This
requirement does not apply to parking areas consisting of driveways that serve one or two dwelling
units.
(b) Every vehicle accommodation area shall be designed so that vehicles cannot extend
beyond the perimeter of such area onto adjacent properties or public rights-of-way. Such areas shall
also be designed so that vehicles do not extend over sidewalks or tend to bump against or damage any
wall, vegetation, or other obstruction.
(c) Circulation areas shall be designed so that vehicles can proceed safely without posing a
danger to pedestrians or other vehicles and without interfering with parking areas.
Art. XVIII PARKING
Page #12
(d) Vehicle storage areas are not required to observe any particular configuration but shall
be so located and designed so that the entire amount of required square footage of such
areas can be used for the purpose intended without creating any substantial danger of
injury to persons or property and without impeding vehicular movement in the adjacent
street. (AMENDED 2/4/86)
(e) To the extent practicable, parking shall not be allowed between a building façade
and a street right-of-way in the B-1(c), B-1(g), and B-2 zoning districts.
Section 15-295.1 Design Standards for Bicycle Parking (AMENDED 6/19/12; 11/19/13)
(a) Bicycle parking may be located in any parking area or in other locations that are
easily accessible, clearly visible from the entrance it serves, and do not impede pedestrian
or motorized vehicle movement into or around the site. At least 50 percent of bicycle
parking shall be sheltered. Designating space for bicycle parking within buildings is an
option to consider when feasible.
(b) When a percentage of the required motorized vehicle spaces are provided in a
structure, an equal percentage of the required bicycle spaces shall be located inside that
structure, unless an equivalent number of other accessible covered bicycle parking spaces
are located elsewhere on the site.
(c) Where bicycle parking facilities are not clearly visible to approaching cyclists,
signs shall be posted to direct cyclists to the facilities.
(d) Facilities shall provide at least a 30 inch clearance from the centerline of each adjacent
bicycle rack/support structure and at least 24 inches from walls or other obstructions.
(e) An aisle or other space shall be provided for bicycles to enter and leave the facility.
The aisle shall have a width of at least four feet to the front or the rear of a standard
six-foot bicycle parked in the facility.
(f) Each bicycle parking space shall be sufficient to accommodate a bicycle at least
six feet in length and two feet wide. Overhead clearance shall be at least seven feet.
(g) Bicycle parking spaces shall be clearly marked as such and shall be separated
from motorized vehicle parking by some form of physical barrier designed to protect a bicycle
from being hit by a motorized vehicle.
(h) Each bicycle parking space shall be provided with some form of stable frame
permanently anchored to a foundation to which a bicycle frame and both wheels may be
conveniently secured using either a chain and padlock or a U-lock. The frame shall supArt.
XVIII PARKING
Page #13
port a bicycle in a stable position without damage to the frame, wheels, or components.
The rack designs commonly known as “inverted U”, “A”, and “post-and-loop” are preferred
types. The “wave”, “toast”, and “comb” racks, as described in Chapter 7, Figure 7-
60, of the Comprehensive Bicycle Transportation Plan, are discouraged and shall not
count toward fulfillment of the requirements in Sec. 15-291(h). (AMENDED 11/19/13)
(i) Bicycle racks should be designed and constructed according to Design Guidelines
of the Carrboro Bicycle Plan.
Section 15-296 Vehicle Accommodation Area Surfaces
(a) Subject to subsections (e), (f), (g), and (h) vehicle accommodation areas that (i)
include lanes for drive-in windows; (ii) are required to contain more than 1,000 square feet of
vehicle storage area; or (iii) contain parking areas that are required to have more than ten parking
spaces and that are used regularly at least five days per week shall be graded and surfaced with
asphalt, concrete or other material that will provide equivalent protection against potholes, erosion,
and dust. Specifications for surfaces meeting the standard set forth in this subsection are contained in
Appendix D. (AMENDED 2/4/86; 3/4/86; 6/26/90; 5/6/03)
(b) Vehicle accommodation areas that are not provided with the type of surface specified in
subsection (a) shall be graded and surfaced with crushed stone, gravel, or other suitable material (as
provided in the specifications set forth in Appendix D) to provide a surface that is stable and will help
to reduce dust and erosion. The perimeter of such parking areas shall be defined by bricks, stones,
railroad ties, or other similar devices. In addition, whenever such a vehicle accommodation area abuts
a paved street, the driveway leading from such street to such area (or, if there is no driveway, the
portion of the vehicle accommodation area that opens onto such streets), shall be paved as provided in
subsection (a) for a distance of fifteen feet back from the edge of the paved street. This subsection shall
not apply to single-family residences, duplexes, multi-family residences consisting of two dwelling
units, homes for the handicapped or infirm, or other uses that are required to have only one or two
parking spaces.
(c) Parking spaces in areas surfaced in accordance with subsection (a) shall be appropriately
demarcated with painted lines or other markings. Parking spaces in areas surfaced in accordance with
subsection (b) shall be demarcated whenever practicable.
(d) Vehicle accommodation areas shall be properly maintained in all respects. In particular,
and without limiting the foregoing, vehicle accommodation area surfaces shall be kept in good
condition (free from potholes, etc.) and parking space lines or markings shall be kept clearly visible and
distinct.
(e) Vehicle accommodation areas that constitute 10.100 classification uses (independent
automobile parking lots or garages) and that contain more than ten parking spaces shall meet the
surfacing requirements set forth in subsection (a) unless it clearly appears that the 10.100 classification
use is intended to be temporary (not exceeding four years). In no event may the 10.100 use continue for
more than four years unless the lot is paved in accordance with this subsection. Notwithstanding the
Art. XVIII PARKING
Page #14
provisions of Article VIII (Nonconforming Situations), (i) any parking lot made nonconforming by this
subsection on its effective date shall be brought into compliance within twelve months after the
effective date, and (ii) unpaved temporary 10.100 uses in operation on the effective date of this
subsection must be paved or terminated within one year thereafter or four years from the initial use of
such lot, whichever comes later. (AMENDED 3/11/86)
(f) The paving requirement of subsection (a) shall not apply to parking areas owned or
leased by the town that are used for public parking for a period of time less than four years. If such
areas are used for parking for a period in excess of four years, then such areas must be paved if
otherwise required under the standards set forth in subsection (a). (AMENDED 3/4/86)
(g) The paving requirement of subsection (a) shall not apply to any lot within the B-1(c)
zoning district. However, lots that would otherwise be required to be paved but for this
exception shall be required to comply with the shading provisions set out in Subsection
15-317. (AMENDED 6/26/90)
(h) When any tract of land is developed under circumstances requiring the issuance of a
special or conditional use permit, and paving is required per Section 15-296(a), the
vehicle overhang area located behind a parking stop may be unpaved as shown in
Appendix D-3. (AMENDED 5/6/03)
Section 15-297 Joint Use of Required Parking Spaces (AMENDED 5/18/04)
(a) One parking area may contain required spaces for several different uses, but except as
otherwise provided in this section, the required space assigned to one use may not be credited to any
other use.
(b) To the extent that developments that wish to make joint use of the same parking spaces
operate at different times, the same spaces may be credited to both uses. For example, if a parking lot
is used in connection with an office building on Monday through Friday but is generally 90% vacant on
weekends, another development that operates only on weekends could be credited with 90% of the
spaces on that lot. Or, if a church parking lot is generally occupied only to 50% of capacity on days
other than Sunday, another development could make use of 50% of the church lot’s spaces on those
other days.
(c) With respect to properties within the B-1(c), B-1(g), and B-2 districts where two
or more use classifications on the same site have two or more distinct peak parking usage
periods, the number of parking spaces required may be reduced to the amount that results
from dividing the total number of spaces otherwise required by the following ratios:
Use Classifications Reduction Ratio
2.000 and 3.000 uses 1.2
2.000 and 1.500 uses 1.3
2.000 and 1.100/1.200/1.300 uses 1.2
3.000 and 1.500 uses 1.7
Art. XVIII PARKING
Page #15
Use Classifications Reduction Ratio
3.000 and 1.100/1.200/1.300 1.4
1.500 and 1.100/1.200/1.300 1.1
(d) If the joint use of the same parking spaces by two or more principal uses involves
satellite parking spaces, then the provisions of Section 15-298 are also applicable.
Section 15-297.1 Creation of Public Parking Lots from Private Parking Areas (AMENDMENT
4/15/03)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, within the B-1(c) and B-1(g) zoning
districts:
(1) The town may acquire through lease or purchase portions of one or more lots
and create out of the area so acquired an independent parking lot (use
classification 10.100);
(2) Acquisition by the town and use of portions of lots as provided in this section
shall not be regarded as creating a non-conforming situation with respect to
parking on such lots or making any existing situation more non-conforming with
respect to parking.
(3) When the town acquires and uses portions of lots as provided in this section, the
number of spaces within the public parking lot so created that are attributable to
the portion of the parking lot acquired from each “donor” lot shall be regarded
as still being located on each “donor” lot for purposes of determining whether
each “donor” lot complies with the parking requirements of this article.
Section 15-298 Satellite Parking
(a) If the number of off-street parking spaces required by this chapter cannot reasonably be
provided on the same lot where the principal use associated with these parking spaces is located, then
spaces may be provided on adjacent or nearby lots in accordance with the provisions of this section.
These off- site spaces are referred to in this section as “satellite” parking spaces.
(b) All such satellite parking (except spaces intended for employee use or spaces required
in relation to use 8.800, Performing Arts Space) may be located within 1000 feet of the
public entrance of a principal building housing the use associated with such parking.
(AMENDED 11/27/18)
(c) The developer wishing to take advantage of the provisions of this section must present
satisfactory written evidence that he has the permission of the owner or other person in charge of the
satellite parking spaces to use such spaces. The developer must also sign an acknowledgment that the
continuing validity of his permit depends upon his continuing ability to provide the requisite number or
parking spaces.
Art. XVIII PARKING
Page #16
(d) Subject to subsection (e), persons who obtain satellite parking spaces in accordance
with this section shall not be held accountable for ensuring that the satellite parking areas from which
they obtain their spaces satisfy the design requirements of this article. (AMENDED 3/11/86)
(e) Satellite parking may be obtained from an independent automobile parking lot or garage
[use classification 10.100, see definition subdivision 15-15(32.1)]. However, if a separate lot is owned
by an enterprise needing off-site parking and is leased by that enterprise for a period of more than four
years (including automatic renewals or renewal options) and is used as a parking lot by that enterprise
(and others may lawfully be excluded), then such off-site lot shall be regarded as part of the lot on
which the enterprise is located for purposes of the paving and other design requirements of this chapter.
(AMENDED 3/11/86)
Section 15-299 Special Provisions for Lots With Existing Buildings and Lots within
Neighborhood Preservation Districts (AMENDED 9/26/89)
(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, whenever (i) there exists a lot
with one or more structures on it constructed before the effective date of this chapter, and (ii) a
change in use to other than a performing arts space (use classification 8.800) that does not involve
any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot, and (iii) the parking requirements of Section
15-291 that would be applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such
lot because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking,
then the developer need only comply with the requirements of Section 15-291 to the
extent that (i) parking space is practicably available on the lot where the development is located,
and (ii) satellite parking space is reasonably available as provided in Section 15-298.
However, if satellite parking subsequently becomes reasonably available, then it shall be a continuing
condition of the permit authorizing development on such lot that the developer obtain satellite
parking when it does become available. (AMENDED 11/27/18)
(b) Whenever the neighborhood preservation district commission determines that the
number of parking spaces otherwise required by this article for a development within the neighborhood
preservation district would render such development incongruous with the special character of the
district, it may recommend that the permit-issuing authority wholly or partially waive such parking
requirements. Upon such recommendation, the permit-issuing authority may authorize a lesser number
of parking spaces than that presumptively required under this article if it concludes that such deviation
(i) will not create problems due to increased on-street parking and (ii) will not constitute a threat to
public safety. (AMENDED 09/26/89)
Section 15-300 Loading and Unloading Areas.
(a) Whenever the normal operation of any development requires that goods, merchandise,
or equipment be routinely delivered to or shipped from that development, a sufficient off-street loading
and unloading area must be provided in accordance with this section to accommodate the delivery or
shipment operations in a safe and convenient manner.
Art. XVIII PARKING
Page #17
(b) The loading and unloading area must be of sufficient size to accommodate the numbers
and types of vehicles that are likely to use this area, given the nature of the development in question.
The following table indicates the number and size of spaces that, presumptively, satisfy the standard set
forth in this subsection. However, the permit-issuing authority may require more or less loading and
unloading area if reasonably necessary to satisfy the foregoing standard.
GROSS LEASABLE AREA OF BUILDING NUMBER OF SPACES WITH MINIMUM DIMENSIONS
OF 12’ x 55’ AND OVERHEAD CLEARANCE OF 14’
FROM THE STREET GRADE
1,000 - 19,999 1
20,000 - 79,999 2
80,000 - 127,999 3
128,000 - 191,999 4
192,000 - 255,999 5
256,000 - 319,999 6
320,000 - 391,999 7
Plus one (1) for each additional 72,000 square feet or fraction thereof.
Art. XVIII PARKING
Page #18
(c) Loading and unloading areas shall be so located and designed that the vehicles intended
to use them can (i) maneuver safely and conveniently to and from a public right-of-way, and (ii)
complete the loading and unloading operations without obstructing or interfering with any public
right-of-way or any parking space or parking lot aisle.
(d) No area allocated to loading and unloading facilities may be used to satisfy the area
requirements for off-street parking, nor shall any portion of any off-street parking area be used to satisfy
the area requirements for loading and unloading facilities.
Section 15-301 No Parking Indicated Near Fire Hydrants.
Whenever a fire hydrant is located adjacent to any portion of a vehicle accommodation area
required to be paved under subsection 15-296(a), the pavement shall be clearly marked to indicate that
parking within fifteen feet of such hydrant is prohibited. (AMENDED 4/27/82)
Section 15-302 Limitation on the Total Lot Coverage Devoted to Surface Parking
No development approved after the effective date of this section may construct more than 110
percent of the number of parking spaces determined by the permit issuing authority to be necessary
to satisfy the requirements of Section 15-291.

ARTICLE XIX
SCREENING AND TREES
PART I. SCREENING
Section 15-304 Board Findings Concerning the Need for Screening Requirements.
The Board finds that:
(1) Screening between two lots lessens the transmission from one lot to another of
noise, dust, and glare.
(2) Screening can lessen the visual pollution that may otherwise occur within an
urbanized area. Even minimal screening can provide an impression of separation
of spaces, and more extensive screening can shield entirely one use from the
visual assault of an adjacent use.
(3) Screening can establish a greater sense of privacy from visual or physical
intrusion, the degree of privacy varying with the intensity of the screening.
(4) The provisions of this part are necessary to safeguard the public health, safety, and
welfare.
Section 15-305 General Screening Standards
Every development shall provide sufficient screening so that:
(1) Neighboring properties are shielded from any adverse external effects of that
development;
(2) The development is shielded from the negative impacts of adjacent uses such as
streets or railroads.
Section 15-306 Compliance with Screening Standards
(a) The table set forth in Section 15-308, in conjunction with the explanations in
Section 15-307 concerning the types of screens, establishes screening requirements that,
presumptively, satisfy the general standards established in Section 15-305. However, this table is
only intended to establish a presumption and should be flexibly administered, as provided in
Section 15-309.
(b) The numerical designations contained in the Table of Screening Requirements
(Section 15-308) are keyed to the Table of Permissible Uses (Section 15-146), and the letter
designations refer to types of screening as described in Section 15-307. This table indicates the
Art. XIX - SCREENING AND TREES
Page #2
type of screening that may be required between two uses. Where such screening is required, only
one of the two adjoining uses is responsible for installing the screening; the use assigned this
responsibility is referred to as the “servient” use in Section 15-308, and the other use is the
“dominant” use. To determine which of the two adjoining uses is required to install the
screening, find the use classification number of one of the adjoining uses in the servient column
and follow that column across the page to its intersection with the use classification number in
the dominant use column that corresponds to the other adjoining use. If the intersecting square
contains a letter, then the use whose classification number is in the servient column is
responsible for installing that level of screening. If the intersecting square does not contain a
letter, then begin the process again, starting this time in the servient column with the other
adjoining use.
(c) If, when the analysis described in subsection (b) is performed, the servient use is
an existing use, but the required screening is not in place, then this lack of screening shall
constitute a nonconforming situation, subject to all the provisions of Article VIII of this
ordinance.
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, a multi-family development
shall be required at the time of construction, to install any screening that is required between it
and adjacent existing uses according to the table set forth in Section 15-308, regardless of
whether, in relation to such other uses, the multi-family development is the dominant or servient
use.
Section 15-307 Descriptions of Screens.
The following three basic types of screens are hereby established and are used as the basis
for the Table of Screening Requirements set forth in Section 15-308.
(1) OPAQUE SCREEN. TYPE “A”. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height
of at least six feet, with intermittent visual obstructions from the opaque portion to
a height of at least twenty feet. An opaque screen is intended to exclude
completely all visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of
spatial separation. The opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence,
landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of
planted vegetation screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the
average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field
observation of existing vegetation. The opaque portion of the screen must be
opaque in all seasons of the year. At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual
obstruction should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than
ten feet wide. The portion of intermittent visual obstructions may contain
deciduous plants. Suggested planting patterns that will achieve this standard are
included in Appendix E.
(2) SEMI-OPAQUE SCREEN. TYPE “B”. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a
height of three feet, with intermittent visual obstruction from above the opaque

portion to a height of at least twenty feet. The semi-opaque screen is intended to
partially block visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of
the separation of spaces. The semi-opaque screen may be composed of a wall,
fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation.
Compliance of planted vegetation screens or natural vegetation will be judged on
the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject
species, or field observation of existing vegetation. At maturity, the portion of
intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed
openings more than ten feet wide. The zone for intermittent visual obstruction
may contain deciduous plants. Suggested planting patterns which will achieve
this standard are included in Appendix E.
(3) BROKEN SCREEN. TYPE “C”. A screen composed of intermittent visual
obstructions from the ground to a height of at least twenty feet. The broken screen
is intended to create the impression of a separation of spaces without necessarily
eliminating visual contact between the spaces. It may be composed of a wall,
fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation.
Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on
the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject
species, or field observation of existing vegetation. The screen may contain
deciduous plants. Suggested planting patterns which will achieve this standard
are included in Appendix E.

Section 15-309 Flexibility in Administration Required.
(a) The Board recognizes that because of the wide variety of types of developments
and the relationships between them, it is neither possible nor prudent to establish inflexible
screening requirements. Therefore, as provided in Section 15-306, the permit-issuing authority
may permit deviations from the presumptive requirements of Section 15-308 and may require
either more intensive or less intensive screening whenever it finds such deviations are more
likely to satisfy the standard set forth in Section 15-308 without imposing unnecessary costs on
the developer.
(b) Without limiting the generality of subsection (a), the permit-issuing authority may
modify the presumptive requirements for:
(1) Commercial developments located adjacent to residential uses in business
zoning districts.
(2) Commercial uses located adjacent to other commercial uses within the
same zoning district.
(3) Uses located within planned unit developments.
(c) Whenever the permit-issuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the
presumptive requirements set forth in Section 15-308, it shall enter on the face of the permit the
screening requirement that it imposes to meet the standard set forth in Section 15-308 and the
reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation.
(d) If the permit-issuing authority concludes, based upon information it (or the
appearance commission) receives in the consideration of a specific development proposal, that a
presumption established by Section 15-308 is erroneous, it shall initiate a request for an
amendment to the Table of Screening Requirements in accordance with the procedures set forth
in Article XX.
Section 15-310 Combination Uses.
(a) In determining the screening requirements that apply between a combination use
and another use, the permit-issuing authority shall proceed as if the principal uses that comprise
the combination use were not combined and reach its determination accordingly, relying on the
table set forth in Section 15-308, interpreted in the light of Section 15-309.
(b) When two or more principal uses are combined to create a combination-use,
screening shall not be required between the composite principal uses unless they are clearly
separated physically and screening is determined to be necessary to satisfy the standard set forth
in Section 15-305. (For example, screening may be required in a residential combination use
consisting of single-family and multi-family components.)

Section 15-311 Landscaping Plan.
Any person who has been issued a permit under this chapter for any development in a
non-residential district involving the construction of new buildings or parking areas or additions
to or exterior modifications of existing buildings or parking areas, as well as (i) any similar
development in a residential district, if such development requires a special or conditional use
permit, shall prepare and file a landscaping plan prior to the issuance of a building permit for
such development. No building permit shall be issued for such development until the
Appearance Commission has had the opportunity, pursuant to regular agenda procedures, to
review and comment upon such landscaping plan. (AMENDED 2/4/86)
Section 15-311.1 Screening of Flag Lots in the Historic District (HD) (AMENDED
11/21/95).
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 15-308, every flag lot in the Historic District

PART II. SHADING AND TREE PROTECTION
Section 15-314 Board Findings and Declaration of Policy on Protecting Trees and Other
Plants (REWRITTEN 06/24/14)
(a) The Board finds that:
(1) Trees, shrubs, and other plants are proven producers of oxygen, a
necessary element for human survival; and
(2) Trees, shrubs, and other plants appreciably reduce carbon emissions by
shading buildings and thereby lowering energy use to cool buildings; and
(3) Trees, shrubs, and other plants improve air quality by lowering air
temperatures and removing air pollutants; and
(4) Trees, shrubs, and other plants transpire considerable amounts of water
each day and thereby maintain the natural hydrologic cycle; and
(5) Trees, shrubs, and other plants through their canopies and root systems
intercept precipitation and encourage rain to infiltrate into the soil and
maintain soil water for plants and recharge ground water and play an
important and effective part in soil conservation, erosion control, creek
protection and flood control; and
(6) Trees, especially large, old trees, provide invaluable beneficial physical,
aesthetic, historic, and psychological counterpoint to the urban setting,
making urban life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling the
air and land, and built environment, reducing noise levels and glare,
shielding people from high winds, and breaking the monotony of human
developments on the land, particularly for parking areas and streets; and
(7) Trees, shrubs and other plants help improve soil quality by breaking up
heavy soils, mining nutrients and remediating soils at contaminated sites
by absorbing, transforming and containing a number of contaminants; and
(8) Tree stands create habitats that support a diversity of plants and animals;
and
(9) Trees, shrubs and other plants make important contributions to the vitality
and character of the Town and its neighborhoods and create a more
aesthetic, pleasant and emotionally satisfying place in which to live, work
and spend leisure time; and
Art. XIX - SCREENING AND TREES
Page #17
(10) Trees, shrubs and other plants provide numerous human health benefits
such as shading ultraviolet radiation, reducing rates of respiratory disease
and illness and stress management; and
(11) Trees, shrubs and other plants have an important impact on the desirability
of land and, consequently, on property values, as well as benefitting
commercial activity by creating a more enjoyable environment.
(AMENDED 03/21/89)
(b) Based upon the findings set forth in subsection (a), the Board declares that it is not
only desirable but essential to the health, safety, and welfare of all persons living or working
within the town’s planning jurisdiction, present and future, to protect certain existing trees and
tree stands and, under the circumstances set forth in this article, to require the planting of new
trees in certain types of developments.

Section 15-316 Required Trees Along Dedicated Streets.
Along both sides of all newly created streets with respect to which an offer of dedication
is required to be made by this chapter, the developer shall either plant or retain sufficient trees so
Art. XIX - SCREENING AND TREES
Page #19
that, between the paved portion of the street and a line running parallel to and fifty feet from the
center line of the street, there is for every thirty feet of street frontage at least an average of one
deciduous tree that has or will have when fully mature a trunk at least twelve inches in diameter.
Trees planted to satisfy this section shall not be placed uniformly but in an irregular pattern with
a minimum of one twelve inch (12”) diameter tree (when fully mature) every one hundred feet
(100’). When trees are planted by the developer pursuant to this section, the developer shall
choose trees that meet the standards set forth in Appendix E. (AMENDED 11/19/96)
Section 15-317 Retention and Protection of Specimen and Rare Trees
(a) Every development shall retain all existing specimen and rare trees unless the
retention of such trees would unreasonably burden the development. When a site would be so
unreasonably burdened by the retention of all such trees that a choice must be made as to which
trees will be retained, the following criteria shall be used by the applicant, in consultation with
the land use administrator and landscape or forestry profession also to evaluate the trees for the
purpose of deciding which to retain: (AMENDED 06/24/14)
(1) The rareness of the tree species, both relative to the species representation
on the site and relative to the species representation within the region and
the state. This shall be the most important criterion in the evaluation;
(2) The tree’s relative size and age, large old trees being considered more
valuable than smaller, younger trees of the same species;
(3) The trees’ relative expected longevities, including such factors as the
trees’ relative health at the time of the evaluation;
(4) The relative hardiness of the trees in question, including wind firmness,
climatic requirements, susceptibility to insects and diseases;
(5) The trees’ relative aesthetic values, including flowers, fruit, form
characteristics, potential for autumn coloration;
(6) The trees’ relative sizes at maturity;
(7) The trees’ relative contribution to summertime comfort through their
potential to provide shading. (AMENDED 03/21/89)
(b) Flexible approaches such as adjustments to lot layout, placement of buildings and
paved surfaces and location of utilities should be pursued in order to save rare and specimen
trees. (AMENDED 03/21/89; 06/24/14)
(c) No excavation or other subsurface disturbance may be undertaken within the Tree
Protection Perimeter around any tree to be retained in accordance with (a) above. In addition, no
impervious surface (including but not limited to equipment, paving, and structures) may be
Art. XIX - SCREENING AND TREES
Page #20
located within the Tree Protection Perimeter, either during construction or after completion of the
development. (AMENDED 03/21/89; 06/24/14)
(d) There shall be no clearcutting in any development within the Transition Area
portion of the Carrboro Joint Development Area as identified in the Joint Planning Agreement. The
term “clearcutting” shall refer to the large-scale, indiscriminate removal of trees, shrubs, and
undergrowth with the intention of preparing real property for nonagricultural purposes.
(AMENDED 05/25/99; 06/24/14)
(e) If space that would otherwise be devoted to parking cannot be so used because of
the requirements of subsections (a) or (b), and, as a result, the parking requirements set forth in
Article XVIII cannot be satisfied, the number of required spaces may be reduced by the number
of spaces “lost” because of the provisions of subsections (a) and (b), up to a maximum of fifteen
percent of the required spaces. (AMENDED 06/24/14)
Section 15-318 Shade Trees In Parking Areas.
(a) Vehicle accommodation areas containing more than four parking spaces that are
required by Section 15-296 must be shaded by deciduous trees (either retained or planted by
developer) that have or will have when fully mature a truck at least twelve inches in diameter.
When trees are planted by the developer to satisfy the requirements of this subsection, the
developer shall choose trees that meet the standards set forth in Appendix E. (AMENDED
11/10/81; 06/24/14)
(b) Each tree of the type described in subsection (a) shall be presumed to shade a
circular area having a radius of fifteen feet with the trunk of the tree as the center, and there must
be sufficient trees so that, using this standard, thirty-five percent of the vehicle accommodation
area will be shaded. (AMENDED 06/24/14)
(c) No paving may be placed within 15 feet (measured from the trunk) of any tree
retained to comply with subsection (a), unless such tree is eighteen inches or greater in diameter
or a very rare species as described in Section 15-316, in which case no paving may be placed
within the Tree Protection Perimeter for such trees as described in 15-316(b). New trees planted
to comply with subsection (a) shall be located so that they are surrounded by at least 200 square
feet of unpaved area. (AMENDED 5/10/83; 03/21/89)
(d) Vehicle accommodation areas shall be laid out and detailed to prevent vehicles
from striking trees. Vehicles will be presumed to have a body overhang of three feet six inches.
(e) The foregoing requirements shall not apply to 19.100 classification uses where
such uses do not involve the construction of a permanent structure and are conducted not more
than two days per week on the site of a vehicle accommodation area that is used primarily in
connection with another use. Furthermore, when a 19.100 classification use meeting the
foregoing requirements is installed on a lot that is nonconforming with respect to the shading
requirements of this section, the lot shall not be required to comply with these shading
Art. XIX - SCREENING AND TREES
Page #21
requirements solely because of installation of such use, even thought a new permit applicable to
the entire lot may be required. (AMENDED 9/2/86)
Section 15-319 Tree Canopy Coverage Standards (REWRITTEN 06/24/14)
(a) Minimum Canopy Coverage Standards
Subject to the remaining provisions of this section, the following minimum tree canopy coverage
percentages are required within the boundaries of every lot or tract for which a zoning, special
use, or conditional use permit is issued after [date] _______, exclusive of required cleared active
recreation areas, water bodies, access easements, public and private right-of-way, stormwater and
utility easements.
Table 1: Minimum Tree Canopy Coverage Standards
Land Use Minimum Canopy Coverage
Residential 40%
Other than residential excluding districts (B-
1(c), (B-1(g), (B-2)
30%
Other than residential in districts (B-1(c), (B-
1(g), (B-2)
15%
(1) When a tract is subdivided and pursuant to the provisions of Article XIII the developer sets
aside open space areas or recreation areas that contain canopy trees (with a minimum caliper of
six inches) or when a developer of a subdivision plants canopy trees to comply with the shading
requirements of Article XIII, the total tree canopy area so preserved or established shall be
credited against the minimum canopy coverage percentages set forth above. The remaining
required tree canopy coverage area shall be allocated by the subdivider among the subdivided
lots, and this allocation shall be shown on the recorded plat of such subdivision.
(b) Modifications to Canopy Coverage Standards
The permit issuing authority may approve a development application that does not fully comply
with the canopy coverage standards when it finds that the application substantially complies with
these standards and that such a deviation enables the development to better achieve other Town
objectives, such as the promotion of solar access to encourage active and passive solar
technology for water and space heating and renewable energy generation, improved stormwater
management, and the preservation of established managed landscapes, or established
streetscapes.
(c) Implementation of Standards
Compliance with the tree canopy standards shall be achieved as follows:
Art. XIX - SCREENING AND TREES
Page #22
1) Protection of existing tree canopy. The extent of existing tree canopy coverage retained at the
time of permit application may be documented by survey or by using current aerial photographs
available on the Town’s web page or similar resource. Protection of the existing tree canopy will
be demonstrated by the tree protection plan required by Section 15-320;
2) Replacement of canopy. If the existing protected tree canopy is less than the minimum
standard as shown in Table 1, the deficit shall be made up by the planting of additional trees as
provided herein:
a. One (1) replacement tree per 500 square feet of tree canopy coverage deficit shall be
planted in accordance with an approved planting plan.
b. All canopy trees planted to meet the Town’s screening and parking lot shading
standards can be counted when calculating replacement canopy trees provided.
c. Supplemental canopy trees planted to complete the canopy coverage requirements
shall be planted no less than twenty (20) feet from any other proposed or existing canopy
tree.
d. Replacement trees that are planted in an adjacent right-of-way may count toward total
tree canopy.
e. Replacement tree caliper shall be two and one-half (2.5) inches at installation. A
replacement tree with a caliper of four (4) inches or greater may count for two
replacement trees.
Section 15-320 Protection of Trees During Construction.
(a) The permit recipient shall be responsible for ensuring that all existing trees
specifically shown on approved plans as being retained to comply with this article are protected,
during the construction process, from removal, destruction, or injury. As described in Appendix
A, a tree protection plan detailing the methods for such protection shall be submitted as part of
the land use permit application and construction plan package. Tree protection methods shall
meet accepted industry standards in accordance with ANSI A300 and associated Best Practices.
(AMENDED 3/12/85; 2/24/87; 03/21/89; 06/24/14)
(1) The permit recipient shall ensure that, before any excavation takes place
on the site, a barrier is erected around the Tree Protection Perimeter of all
trees to be retained on the site that are within the area to be disturbed by
construction activities, and other provisions made such as are necessary
and sufficient to put on notice all construction personnel that the area
within the Tree Protection Perimeter of all such trees is to be retained is
not be disturbed. During the construction process, the permit recipient
shall ensure that all activities are kept outside the Tree Protection
Perimeter of all such trees. The barrier required by this subsection shall be
installed before the issuance of any grading or construction permits for
such site. (AMENDED 06/24/14)
Art. XIX - SCREENING AND TREES
Page #23
(2) The permit recipient shall ensure that all such trees to be retained on the
site that are within the area to be disturbed by construction activities, or
near roads within the development, shall be further protected from
accidental equipment damage by wrapping their trunks with sections of
snow fence or boards wired together from the ground to a height six (6)
feet above the ground. (AMENDED 06/24/14)
(3) The permit recipient shall ensure that land disturbing activity shall not
occur, and that building materials, construction trailers, vehicles,
equipment or machinery, dirt, fill, and/or other debris shall not be stored
within the Tree Protection Perimeter of such trees as are to be retained.
(4) The permit recipient shall ensure that all such trees as are to be preserved
shall not be used as supports for roping, cable, signs, or fencing, and that
nails shall not be driven into the trunks of trees.
(5) The permit recipient shall ensure that any damage done during
construction to the limbs or trunks of such trees as are to be retained shall
be properly treated so as to assure the continued health of the trees. The
land use administrator shall be consulted, and may suggest that the
applicant seek advice from landscape or forestry professionals as to the
appropriate method for such treatment. (AMENDED 06/24/14)
(6) Prior to the commencement of any land alteration on a site for which a
Tree Protection Plan has been approved, including all clearing or grading
activities, the land use administrator shall certify in writing based on an
inspection of the site that all tree protection measures required by the
approved Tree Protection Plan have been put in place properly and
accurately. The land use administrator shall provide this certification in a
timely fashion on being notified by the permit recipient that the site is
ready for such inspection and certification. (AMENDED 03/21/89)
(b) If a violation of subsection (a) occurs, and as a result (b) rare or specimen tree(s)
specifically shown on approved plans as being retained die or otherwise must be removed within
four years after a certificate of occupancy is granted for that portion of a development on which
the trees are or were located, then the permit recipient shall be required to replace such trees with
trees of the same species, if available, or of a similar species. The choice of the replacement
species, where necessary, shall be made subject to approval by the Town. Each replacement tree
shall be at least of tree diameter equivalent in size to one (1) inch per every four (4) inches of tree
diameter of the tree it replaces, up to a maximum replacement tree diameter of five inches. In
cases where the tree to be replaced had a diameter greater than twenty inches, it shall be replaced
by more than one tree, such that the ratio of one inch of replacement tree diameter to four inches
of original tree diameter is satisfied, and at least one of the replacement trees is of the maximum
replacement tree diameter of five inches. In addition, no replacement tree may be smaller than
one inch in diameter. For example, a twenty-eight inch diameter tree would be replaced by one
Art. XIX - SCREENING AND TREES
Page #24
five inch diameter tree and one two-inch diameter tree of the same species. Tree replacement
shall be performed by either a landscape contractor or forester licensed to practice in the State of
North Carolina, or by an arborist certified by the International Society of Arboriculture or
National Arborists Association. Such replacement must take place within one year after the
death or removal of the trees occur, and this obligation shall be a continuing condition of the
validity of the permit. Violators of the tree protection requirements described in subsection (a)
shall be subject to the penalties and remedies for all land use ordinance and land use permit
condition violations described in Section 15-114. (AMENDED 03/21/89; 06/24/14)
Section 15-321 Performance Security May Be Required (AMENDED 03/21/89; 10/24/06;
06/24/14)
(a) In cases when the land use administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
Tree Protection Plan has been violated, he or she may require that the developer post a security,
for the five year period (four years plus one year in which replacement may occur) described in
subsections (b) and (c) of section 15-318, to cover the potential replacement of all such large and
rare species trees as are called out in the Tree Protection Plan as being protected. The purpose of
this security is to ensure that the financial capability will exist, during the full five year period
described in subsections (b) and (c) of section 15-318, to replace any large or rare species trees as
are called out on a Tree Protection Plan as being protected during construction, and which have
died due to construction damage caused by a violation of the Tree Protection Plan.
(b) It is the intent of this section that the removal and replacement of such trees that
die due to construction damage shall be arranged by the Town only when the developer cannot be
located at the time when the removal and replacement becomes necessary.
(c) The required security shall be in the form of an interest-bearing account or
certificate of deposit payable to the Town, in the amount necessary for the removal of all of the
large and rare species trees as are called out in the Tree Protection Plan as being preserved, their
replacement as described in subsections (b) and (c) of section 15-318, and the one-time violation
penalty described in section 15-114 at the time the security is required. At such time as the four
year period described in subsections (b) and (c) of section 15-318 is complete, and no deaths of
trees called out in the Tree Protection Plan as being preserved have occurred, the security and all
interest accrued on it shall revert to the developer. In the event that some but not all of the
security amount is used or needed for tree removal and replacement at the end of the four year
period described in subsections (b) and (c) of section 15-318, the remaining security amount and
the interest it has accrued shall revert to the developer at the end of that four year period.
Section 15-321.1 Regulation of Forestry Activities. (AMENDED 06/24/14)
(a) The terms “forestry,” “forestry activity,” “forestland,” “forest management plan”
and “timber harvest” shall be defined by and used in the same manner as in G.S. 160A-458.5.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, this chapter does not
regulate either:
Art. XIX - SCREENING AND TREES
Page #25
(1) Forestry activity on forestland that is taxed on the basis of its present-use
value as forestland under G.S. Chpt. 105, Art. 12; or
(2) Forestry activity that is conducted in accordance with a forest management
plan that is prepared or approved by a forester registered in accordance with G.S.
Chpt. 89B.
(c) Notwithstanding subsection (b) above, the Town may deny a zoning, special use,
conditional use, or building permit for a tract of land for a period of up to three years after the
completion of a timber harvest if the harvest results in the removal from that tract of all or
substantially all of the trees protected by this chapter. If the removal of such trees was in willful
violation of the requirements of this chapter, then such permits may be refused for a period of
five years.

ARTICLE XIX
SCREENING AND TREES
PART I. SCREENING
Section 15-304 Board Findings Concerning the Need for Screening Requirements.
The Board finds that:
(1) Screening between two lots lessens the transmission from one lot to another of
noise, dust, and glare.
(2) Screening can lessen the visual pollution that may otherwise occur within an
urbanized area. Even minimal screening can provide an impression of separation
of spaces, and more extensive screening can shield entirely one use from the
visual assault of an adjacent use.
(3) Screening can establish a greater sense of privacy from visual or physical
intrusion, the degree of privacy varying with the intensity of the screening.
(4) The provisions of this part are necessary to safeguard the public health, safety, and
welfare.
Section 15-305 General Screening Standards
Every development shall provide sufficient screening so that:
(1) Neighboring properties are shielded from any adverse external effects of that
development;
(2) The development is shielded from the negative impacts of adjacent uses such as
streets or railroads.
Section 15-306 Compliance with Screening Standards
(a) The table set forth in Section 15-308, in conjunction with the explanations in
Section 15-307 concerning the types of screens, establishes screening requirements that,
presumptively, satisfy the general standards established in Section 15-305. However, this table is
only intended to establish a presumption and should be flexibly administered, as provided in
Section 15-309.
(b) The numerical designations contained in the Table of Screening Requirements
(Section 15-308) are keyed to the Table of Permissible Uses (Section 15-146), and the letter
designations refer to types of screening as described in Section 15-307. This table indicates the
Art. XIX - SCREENING AND TREES
Page #2
type of screening that may be required between two uses. Where such screening is required, only
one of the two adjoining uses is responsible for installing the screening; the use assigned this
responsibility is referred to as the “servient” use in Section 15-308, and the other use is the
“dominant” use. To determine which of the two adjoining uses is required to install the
screening, find the use classification number of one of the adjoining uses in the servient column
and follow that column across the page to its intersection with the use classification number in
the dominant use column that corresponds to the other adjoining use. If the intersecting square
contains a letter, then the use whose classification number is in the servient column is
responsible for installing that level of screening. If the intersecting square does not contain a
letter, then begin the process again, starting this time in the servient column with the other
adjoining use.
(c) If, when the analysis described in subsection (b) is performed, the servient use is
an existing use, but the required screening is not in place, then this lack of screening shall
constitute a nonconforming situation, subject to all the provisions of Article VIII of this
ordinance.
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, a multi-family development
shall be required at the time of construction, to install any screening that is required between it
and adjacent existing uses according to the table set forth in Section 15-308, regardless of
whether, in relation to such other uses, the multi-family development is the dominant or servient
use.
Section 15-307 Descriptions of Screens.
The following three basic types of screens are hereby established and are used as the basis
for the Table of Screening Requirements set forth in Section 15-308.
(1) OPAQUE SCREEN. TYPE “A”. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height
of at least six feet, with intermittent visual obstructions from the opaque portion to
a height of at least twenty feet. An opaque screen is intended to exclude
completely all visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of
spatial separation. The opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence,
landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of
planted vegetation screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the
average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field
observation of existing vegetation. The opaque portion of the screen must be
opaque in all seasons of the year. At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual
obstruction should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than
ten feet wide. The portion of intermittent visual obstructions may contain
deciduous plants. Suggested planting patterns that will achieve this standard are
included in Appendix E.
(2) SEMI-OPAQUE SCREEN. TYPE “B”. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a
height of three feet, with intermittent visual obstruction from above the opaque
Art. XIX - SCREENING AND TREES
Page #3
portion to a height of at least twenty feet. The semi-opaque screen is intended to
partially block visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of
the separation of spaces. The semi-opaque screen may be composed of a wall,
fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation.
Compliance of planted vegetation screens or natural vegetation will be judged on
the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject
species, or field observation of existing vegetation. At maturity, the portion of
intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed
openings more than ten feet wide. The zone for intermittent visual obstruction
may contain deciduous plants. Suggested planting patterns which will achieve
this standard are included in Appendix E.
(3) BROKEN SCREEN. TYPE “C”. A screen composed of intermittent visual
obstructions from the ground to a height of at least twenty feet. The broken screen
is intended to create the impression of a separation of spaces without necessarily
eliminating visual contact between the spaces. It may be composed of a wall,
fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation.
Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on
the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject
species, or field observation of existing vegetation. The screen may contain
deciduous plants. Suggested planting patterns which will achieve this standard
are included in Appendix E.
Section 15-308 Table of Screening Requirements (AMENDED 06/26/07)
[PLEASE REFER TO THE NEXT TEN PAGES]
Page #14
Section 15-309 Flexibility in Administration Required.
(a) The Board recognizes that because of the wide variety of types of developments
and the relationships between them, it is neither possible nor prudent to establish inflexible
screening requirements. Therefore, as provided in Section 15-306, the permit-issuing authority
may permit deviations from the presumptive requirements of Section 15-308 and may require
either more intensive or less intensive screening whenever it finds such deviations are more
likely to satisfy the standard set forth in Section 15-308 without imposing unnecessary costs on
the developer.
(b) Without limiting the generality of subsection (a), the permit-issuing authority may
modify the presumptive requirements for:
(1) Commercial developments located adjacent to residential uses in business
zoning districts.
(2) Commercial uses located adjacent to other commercial uses within the
same zoning district.
(3) Uses located within planned unit developments.
(c) Whenever the permit-issuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the
presumptive requirements set forth in Section 15-308, it shall enter on the face of the permit the
screening requirement that it imposes to meet the standard set forth in Section 15-308 and the
reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation.
(d) If the permit-issuing authority concludes, based upon information it (or the
appearance commission) receives in the consideration of a specific development proposal, that a
presumption established by Section 15-308 is erroneous, it shall initiate a request for an
amendment to the Table of Screening Requirements in accordance with the procedures set forth
in Article XX.
Section 15-310 Combination Uses.
(a) In determining the screening requirements that apply between a combination use
and another use, the permit-issuing authority shall proceed as if the principal uses that comprise
the combination use were not combined and reach its determination accordingly, relying on the
table set forth in Section 15-308, interpreted in the light of Section 15-309.
(b) When two or more principal uses are combined to create a combination-use,
screening shall not be required between the composite principal uses unless they are clearly
separated physically and screening is determined to be necessary to satisfy the standard set forth
in Section 15-305. (For example, screening may be required in a residential combination use
consisting of single-family and multi-family components.)

Section 15-311 Landscaping Plan.
Any person who has been issued a permit under this chapter for any development in a
non-residential district involving the construction of new buildings or parking areas or additions
to or exterior modifications of existing buildings or parking areas, as well as (i) any similar
development in a residential district, if such development requires a special or conditional use
permit, shall prepare and file a landscaping plan prior to the issuance of a building permit for
such development. No building permit shall be issued for such development until the
Appearance Commission has had the opportunity, pursuant to regular agenda procedures, to
review and comment upon such landscaping plan. (AMENDED 2/4/86)
Section 15-311.1 Screening of Flag Lots in the Historic District (HD) (AMENDED
11/21/95).
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 15-308, every flag lot in the Historic District
(HD) shall provide a Type B screen [as described in Section 15-307 (1)] between the flag lot and
adjacent property [see Section 15-175.10(c)].
Section 15-312 Protective Buffer Along Major Roads (AMENDED 05/25/99; 10/23/07)
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 15-308, but subject to the remaining provisions
of this section, an undisturbed protective buffer shall be maintained along Old N.C. 86, Dairyland
Road, Union Grove Church Road, Homestead Road, Eubanks Road and Smith Level Road south of
Ray Road that will help preserve the scenic views and elements of this area. With respect to each
property that fronts one of the named streets, any development other than use classification 13.200,
Fire Station, that occurs after the effective date of this section shall provide an undisturbed buffer
(except for necessary crossings) that is a minimum of 50 feet in width and on average is 100 feet in
width along such frontage. If the buffer area does not provide the equivalent of a Type ‘A’ screen,
the developer shall provide a Type ‘A’ screen on the development’s side of the buffer (one hundred
(100) feet from the right-of-way)

PART II. SHADING AND TREE PROTECTION
Section 15-314 Board Findings and Declaration of Policy on Protecting Trees and Other
Plants (REWRITTEN 06/24/14)
(a) The Board finds that:
(1) Trees, shrubs, and other plants are proven producers of oxygen, a
necessary element for human survival; and
(2) Trees, shrubs, and other plants appreciably reduce carbon emissions by
shading buildings and thereby lowering energy use to cool buildings; and
(3) Trees, shrubs, and other plants improve air quality by lowering air
temperatures and removing air pollutants; and
(4) Trees, shrubs, and other plants transpire considerable amounts of water
each day and thereby maintain the natural hydrologic cycle; and
(5) Trees, shrubs, and other plants through their canopies and root systems
intercept precipitation and encourage rain to infiltrate into the soil and
maintain soil water for plants and recharge ground water and play an
important and effective part in soil conservation, erosion control, creek
protection and flood control; and
(6) Trees, especially large, old trees, provide invaluable beneficial physical,
aesthetic, historic, and psychological counterpoint to the urban setting,
making urban life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling the
air and land, and built environment, reducing noise levels and glare,
shielding people from high winds, and breaking the monotony of human
developments on the land, particularly for parking areas and streets; and
(7) Trees, shrubs and other plants help improve soil quality by breaking up
heavy soils, mining nutrients and remediating soils at contaminated sites
by absorbing, transforming and containing a number of contaminants; and
(8) Tree stands create habitats that support a diversity of plants and animals;
and
(9) Trees, shrubs and other plants make important contributions to the vitality
and character of the Town and its neighborhoods and create a more
aesthetic, pleasant and emotionally satisfying place in which to live, work
and spend leisure time; and
Art. XIX - SCREENING AND TREES
Page #17
(10) Trees, shrubs and other plants provide numerous human health benefits
such as shading ultraviolet radiation, reducing rates of respiratory disease
and illness and stress management; and
(11) Trees, shrubs and other plants have an important impact on the desirability
of land and, consequently, on property values, as well as benefitting
commercial activity by creating a more enjoyable environment.
(AMENDED 03/21/89)
(b) Based upon the findings set forth in subsection (a), the Board declares that it is not
only desirable but essential to the health, safety, and welfare of all persons living or working
within the town’s planning jurisdiction, present and future, to protect certain existing trees and
tree stands and, under the circumstances set forth in this article, to require the planting of new
trees in certain types of developments.

Section 15-316 Required Trees Along Dedicated Streets.
Along both sides of all newly created streets with respect to which an offer of dedication
is required to be made by this chapter, the developer shall either plant or retain sufficient trees so
Art. XIX - SCREENING AND TREES
Page #19
that, between the paved portion of the street and a line running parallel to and fifty feet from the
center line of the street, there is for every thirty feet of street frontage at least an average of one
deciduous tree that has or will have when fully mature a trunk at least twelve inches in diameter.
Trees planted to satisfy this section shall not be placed uniformly but in an irregular pattern with
a minimum of one twelve inch (12”) diameter tree (when fully mature) every one hundred feet
(100’). When trees are planted by the developer pursuant to this section, the developer shall
choose trees that meet the standards set forth in Appendix E. (AMENDED 11/19/96)
Section 15-317 Retention and Protection of Specimen and Rare Trees
(a) Every development shall retain all existing specimen and rare trees unless the
retention of such trees would unreasonably burden the development. When a site would be so
unreasonably burdened by the retention of all such trees that a choice must be made as to which
trees will be retained, the following criteria shall be used by the applicant, in consultation with
the land use administrator and landscape or forestry profession also to evaluate the trees for the
purpose of deciding which to retain: (AMENDED 06/24/14)
(1) The rareness of the tree species, both relative to the species representation
on the site and relative to the species representation within the region and
the state. This shall be the most important criterion in the evaluation;
(2) The tree’s relative size and age, large old trees being considered more
valuable than smaller, younger trees of the same species;
(3) The trees’ relative expected longevities, including such factors as the
trees’ relative health at the time of the evaluation;
(4) The relative hardiness of the trees in question, including wind firmness,
climatic requirements, susceptibility to insects and diseases;
(5) The trees’ relative aesthetic values, including flowers, fruit, form
characteristics, potential for autumn coloration;
(6) The trees’ relative sizes at maturity;
(7) The trees’ relative contribution to summertime comfort through their
potential to provide shading. (AMENDED 03/21/89)
(b) Flexible approaches such as adjustments to lot layout, placement of buildings and
paved surfaces and location of utilities should be pursued in order to save rare and specimen
trees. (AMENDED 03/21/89; 06/24/14)
(c) No excavation or other subsurface disturbance may be undertaken within the Tree
Protection Perimeter around any tree to be retained in accordance with (a) above. In addition, no
impervious surface (including but not limited to equipment, paving, and structures) may be
Art. XIX - SCREENING AND TREES
Page #20
located within the Tree Protection Perimeter, either during construction or after completion of the
development. (AMENDED 03/21/89; 06/24/14)
(d) There shall be no clearcutting in any development within the Transition Area
portion of the Carrboro Joint Development Area as identified in the Joint Planning Agreement. The
term “clearcutting” shall refer to the large-scale, indiscriminate removal of trees, shrubs, and
undergrowth with the intention of preparing real property for nonagricultural purposes.
(AMENDED 05/25/99; 06/24/14)
(e) If space that would otherwise be devoted to parking cannot be so used because of
the requirements of subsections (a) or (b), and, as a result, the parking requirements set forth in
Article XVIII cannot be satisfied, the number of required spaces may be reduced by the number
of spaces “lost” because of the provisions of subsections (a) and (b), up to a maximum of fifteen
percent of the required spaces. (AMENDED 06/24/14)
Section 15-318 Shade Trees In Parking Areas.
(a) Vehicle accommodation areas containing more than four parking spaces that are
required by Section 15-296 must be shaded by deciduous trees (either retained or planted by
developer) that have or will have when fully mature a truck at least twelve inches in diameter.
When trees are planted by the developer to satisfy the requirements of this subsection, the
developer shall choose trees that meet the standards set forth in Appendix E. (AMENDED
11/10/81; 06/24/14)
(b) Each tree of the type described in subsection (a) shall be presumed to shade a
circular area having a radius of fifteen feet with the trunk of the tree as the center, and there must
be sufficient trees so that, using this standard, thirty-five percent of the vehicle accommodation
area will be shaded. (AMENDED 06/24/14)
(c) No paving may be placed within 15 feet (measured from the trunk) of any tree
retained to comply with subsection (a), unless such tree is eighteen inches or greater in diameter
or a very rare species as described in Section 15-316, in which case no paving may be placed
within the Tree Protection Perimeter for such trees as described in 15-316(b). New trees planted
to comply with subsection (a) shall be located so that they are surrounded by at least 200 square
feet of unpaved area. (AMENDED 5/10/83; 03/21/89)
(d) Vehicle accommodation areas shall be laid out and detailed to prevent vehicles
from striking trees. Vehicles will be presumed to have a body overhang of three feet six inches.
(e) The foregoing requirements shall not apply to 19.100 classification uses where
such uses do not involve the construction of a permanent structure and are conducted not more
than two days per week on the site of a vehicle accommodation area that is used primarily in
connection with another use. Furthermore, when a 19.100 classification use meeting the
foregoing requirements is installed on a lot that is nonconforming with respect to the shading
requirements of this section, the lot shall not be required to comply with these shading
Art. XIX - SCREENING AND TREES
Page #21
requirements solely because of installation of such use, even thought a new permit applicable to
the entire lot may be required. (AMENDED 9/2/86)
Section 15-319 Tree Canopy Coverage Standards (REWRITTEN 06/24/14)
(a) Minimum Canopy Coverage Standards
Subject to the remaining provisions of this section, the following minimum tree canopy coverage
percentages are required within the boundaries of every lot or tract for which a zoning, special
use, or conditional use permit is issued after June 24th, 2014, exclusive of required cleared active
recreation areas, water bodies, access easements, public and private right-of-way, stormwater and
utility easements.
Table 1: Minimum Tree Canopy Coverage Standards
Land Use Minimum Canopy Coverage
Residential 40%
Other than residential excluding districts (B-
1(c), (B-1(g), (B-2)
30%
Other than residential in districts (B-1(c), (B-
1(g), (B-2)
15%
(1) When a tract is subdivided and pursuant to the provisions of Article XIII the developer sets
aside open space areas or recreation areas that contain canopy trees (with a minimum caliper of
six inches) or when a developer of a subdivision plants canopy trees to comply with the shading
requirements of Article XIII, the total tree canopy area so preserved or established shall be
credited against the minimum canopy coverage percentages set forth above. The remaining
required tree canopy coverage area shall be allocated by the subdivider among the subdivided
lots, and this allocation shall be shown on the recorded plat of such subdivision.
(b) Modifications to Canopy Coverage Standards
The permit issuing authority may approve a development application that does not fully comply
with the canopy coverage standards when it finds that the application substantially complies with
these standards and that such a deviation enables the development to better achieve other Town
objectives, such as the promotion of solar access to encourage active and passive solar
technology for water and space heating and renewable energy generation, improved stormwater
management, and the preservation of established managed landscapes, or established
streetscapes.
(c) Implementation of Standards
Compliance with the tree canopy standards shall be achieved as follows:
Art. XIX - SCREENING AND TREES
Page #22
1) Protection of existing tree canopy. The extent of existing tree canopy coverage retained at the
time of permit application may be documented by survey or by using current aerial photographs
available on the Town’s web page or similar resource. Protection of the existing tree canopy will
be demonstrated by the tree protection plan required by Section 15-320;
2) Replacement of canopy. If the existing protected tree canopy is less than the minimum
standard as shown in Table 1, the deficit shall be made up by the planting of additional trees as
provided herein:
a. One (1) replacement tree per 500 square feet of tree canopy coverage deficit shall be
planted in accordance with an approved planting plan.
b. All canopy trees planted to meet the Town’s screening and parking lot shading
standards can be counted when calculating replacement canopy trees provided.
c. Supplemental canopy trees planted to complete the canopy coverage requirements
shall be planted no less than twenty (20) feet from any other proposed or existing canopy
tree.
d. Replacement trees that are planted in an adjacent right-of-way may count toward total
tree canopy.
e. Replacement tree caliper shall be two and one-half (2.5) inches at installation. A
replacement tree with a caliper of four (4) inches or greater may count for two
replacement trees.
Section 15-320 Protection of Trees During Construction.
(a) The permit recipient shall be responsible for ensuring that all existing trees
specifically shown on approved plans as being retained to comply with this article are protected,
during the construction process, from removal, destruction, or injury. As described in Appendix
A, a tree protection plan detailing the methods for such protection shall be submitted as part of
the land use permit application and construction plan package. Tree protection methods shall
meet accepted industry standards in accordance with ANSI A300 and associated Best Practices.
(AMENDED 3/12/85; 2/24/87; 03/21/89; 06/24/14)
(1) The permit recipient shall ensure that, before any excavation takes place
on the site, a barrier is erected around the Tree Protection Perimeter of all
trees to be retained on the site that are within the area to be disturbed by
construction activities, and other provisions made such as are necessary
and sufficient to put on notice all construction personnel that the area
within the Tree Protection Perimeter of all such trees is to be retained is
not be disturbed. During the construction process, the permit recipient
shall ensure that all activities are kept outside the Tree Protection
Perimeter of all such trees. The barrier required by this subsection shall be
installed before the issuance of any grading or construction permits for
such site. (AMENDED 06/24/14)
Art. XIX - SCREENING AND TREES
Page #23
(2) The permit recipient shall ensure that all such trees to be retained on the
site that are within the area to be disturbed by construction activities, or
near roads within the development, shall be further protected from
accidental equipment damage by wrapping their trunks with sections of
snow fence or boards wired together from the ground to a height six (6)
feet above the ground. (AMENDED 06/24/14)
(3) The permit recipient shall ensure that land disturbing activity shall not
occur, and that building materials, construction trailers, vehicles,
equipment or machinery, dirt, fill, and/or other debris shall not be stored
within the Tree Protection Perimeter of such trees as are to be retained.
(4) The permit recipient shall ensure that all such trees as are to be preserved
shall not be used as supports for roping, cable, signs, or fencing, and that
nails shall not be driven into the trunks of trees.
(5) The permit recipient shall ensure that any damage done during
construction to the limbs or trunks of such trees as are to be retained shall
be properly treated so as to assure the continued health of the trees. The
land use administrator shall be consulted, and may suggest that the
applicant seek advice from landscape or forestry professionals as to the
appropriate method for such treatment. (AMENDED 06/24/14)
(6) Prior to the commencement of any land alteration on a site for which a
Tree Protection Plan has been approved, including all clearing or grading
activities, the land use administrator shall certify in writing based on an
inspection of the site that all tree protection measures required by the
approved Tree Protection Plan have been put in place properly and
accurately. The land use administrator shall provide this certification in a
timely fashion on being notified by the permit recipient that the site is
ready for such inspection and certification. (AMENDED 03/21/89)
(b) If a violation of subsection (a) occurs, and as a result (b) rare or specimen tree(s)
specifically shown on approved plans as being retained die or otherwise must be removed within
four years after a certificate of occupancy is granted for that portion of a development on which
the trees are or were located, then the permit recipient shall be required to replace such trees with
trees of the same species, if available, or of a similar species. The choice of the replacement
species, where necessary, shall be made subject to approval by the Town. Each replacement tree
shall be at least of tree diameter equivalent in size to one (1) inch per every four (4) inches of tree
diameter of the tree it replaces, up to a maximum replacement tree diameter of five inches. In
cases where the tree to be replaced had a diameter greater than twenty inches, it shall be replaced
by more than one tree, such that the ratio of one inch of replacement tree diameter to four inches
of original tree diameter is satisfied, and at least one of the replacement trees is of the maximum
replacement tree diameter of five inches. In addition, no replacement tree may be smaller than
one inch in diameter. For example, a twenty-eight inch diameter tree would be replaced by one
Art. XIX - SCREENING AND TREES
Page #24
five inch diameter tree and one two-inch diameter tree of the same species. Tree replacement
shall be performed by either a landscape contractor or forester licensed to practice in the State of
North Carolina, or by an arborist certified by the International Society of Arboriculture or
National Arborists Association. Such replacement must take place within one year after the
death or removal of the trees occur, and this obligation shall be a continuing condition of the
validity of the permit. Violators of the tree protection requirements described in subsection (a)
shall be subject to the penalties and remedies for all land use ordinance and land use permit
condition violations described in Section 15-114. (AMENDED 03/21/89; 06/24/14)
Section 15-321 Performance Security May Be Required (AMENDED 03/21/89; 10/24/06;
06/24/14)
(a) In cases when the land use administrator has reasonable cause to believe that a
Tree Protection Plan has been violated, he or she may require that the developer post a security,
for the five year period (four years plus one year in which replacement may occur) described in
subsections (b) and (c) of section 15-318, to cover the potential replacement of all such large and
rare species trees as are called out in the Tree Protection Plan as being protected. The purpose of
this security is to ensure that the financial capability will exist, during the full five year period
described in subsections (b) and (c) of section 15-318, to replace any large or rare species trees as
are called out on a Tree Protection Plan as being protected during construction, and which have
died due to construction damage caused by a violation of the Tree Protection Plan.
(b) It is the intent of this section that the removal and replacement of such trees that
die due to construction damage shall be arranged by the Town only when the developer cannot be
located at the time when the removal and replacement becomes necessary.
(c) The required security shall be in the form of an interest-bearing account or
certificate of deposit payable to the Town, in the amount necessary for the removal of all of the
large and rare species trees as are called out in the Tree Protection Plan as being preserved, their
replacement as described in subsections (b) and (c) of section 15-318, and the one-time violation
penalty described in section 15-114 at the time the security is required. At such time as the four
year period described in subsections (b) and (c) of section 15-318 is complete, and no deaths of
trees called out in the Tree Protection Plan as being preserved have occurred, the security and all
interest accrued on it shall revert to the developer. In the event that some but not all of the
security amount is used or needed for tree removal and replacement at the end of the four year
period described in subsections (b) and (c) of section 15-318, the remaining security amount and
the interest it has accrued shall revert to the developer at the end of that four year period.
Section 15-321.1 Regulation of Forestry Activities. (AMENDED 06/24/14)
(a) The terms “forestry,” “forestry activity,” “forestland,” “forest management plan”
and “timber harvest” shall be defined by and used in the same manner as in G.S. 160A-458.5.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, this chapter does not
regulate either:
Art. XIX - SCREENING AND TREES
Page #25
(1) Forestry activity on forestland that is taxed on the basis of its present-use
value as forestland under G.S. Chpt. 105, Art. 12; or
(2) Forestry activity that is conducted in accordance with a forest management
plan that is prepared or approved by a forester registered in accordance with G.S.
Chpt. 89B.
(c) Notwithstanding subsection (b) above, the Town may deny a zoning, special use,
conditional use, or building permit for a tract of land for a period of up to three years after the
completion of a timber harvest if the harvest results in the removal from that tract of all or
substantially all of the trees protected by this chapter. If the removal of such trees was in willful
violation of the requirements of this chapter, then such permits may be refused for a period of
five years.

amendment is consistent with the Land Use Plan, Thoroughfare Plan, or other applicable plans
officially adopted by the Board of Aldermen. The planning board shall provide a written
recommendation to the Board of Aldermen that addresses plan consistency and other matters as
deemed appropriate by the planning board. If no written report is received from the planning

proceed in its consideration of the amendment without the planning board report. (AMENDED
10/24/06)
Art. XX AMENDMENTS

(c) A comment by the planning board that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with
the Land Use Plan, Thoroughfare Plan or other officially adopted plan shall not preclude
consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by the Board of Aldermen, and the Board
of Aldermen is not bound by the recommendations of the planning board. (AMENDED
10/24/06)
(d) A member of the planning board and any other advisory committee that provides
direct advice to the Board of Aldermen (i.e. it does not report to the planning board) shall not
vote on recommendations regarding any zoning map or text amendment where the outcome of
the matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial, and readily
identifiable financial impact on the member. (AMENDED 10/24/06)
Section 15-323 Hearing Required: Notice
(a) No ordinance that amends any of the provisions of this chapter may be adopted until
a public hearing has been held on such ordinance.
(b) The planning staff shall publish a notice of the public hearing on any ordinance that
amends the provisions of this chapter once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper having
general circulation in the Carrboro area. The notice shall be published for the first time not less
than ten days nor more than twenty-five days before the date fixed for the hearing. This period is to
be computed in accordance with G.S. 160A-364, which provides that the date of publication is not
counted but the date of the hearing is.
(c) With respect to all map amendments, the planning staff shall mail, by first class
mail, written notice of the public hearing to the record owners of all properties whose zoning
classification is changed by the proposed amendment as well as the owners of all properties any
portion of which is within 1000 feet of the property rezoned by the amendment. For purposes of
this section the term “owners” shall mean the persons shown as owners on Orange County’s
computerized land records system. The planning staff shall also make reasonable efforts to mail a
similar written notice to the non-owner occupants of residential rental property located within 1,000
feet of the lot that is the subject of the rezoning. The notices required by this subsection shall be
deposited in the mail at least 10 but not more than 25 days prior to the date of the public hearing.
The staff member mailing such notices shall certify to the board that the notices have been mailed,
and such certificate shall be deemed conclusive in the absence of fraud. (AMENDED 10/12/82;
1/22/85; 10/1/85; 04/15/97; 3/26/02)
(d) The first class mail notice required under subsection (c) of this section shall not be
required if the zoning map amendment directly affects more than 50 properties, owned by a total
of at least 50 different property owners, and the Town elects to use the expanded published
notice provided for in this subsection. In this instance, the Town may elect to either make the
mailed notice provided for in subsection (c) of this section or may, as an alternative, elect to
publish notice of the hearing as required by G.S. 160A-364, but provided that each advertisement
shall not be less than one-half (1/2) of a newspaper page in size. The advertisement shall only be
effective for property owners who reside in the area of general circulation of the newspaper
Art. XX AMENDMENTS
Page #4
which publishes the notice. Property owners who reside outside of the newspaper circulation
area, according to the address listed on the most recent Orange County property tax listing for the
affected property, shall be notified according to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section.
(AMENDED 10/24/06)
(e) For proposed zoning map amendments, the planning staff shall prominently post a
notice of the public hearing on the site proposed for a rezoning or an adjacent public street or
highway right-of-way. When multiple parcels are included within a proposed zoning map
amendment, a posting on each individual parcel is not required, but the planning staff shall post
sufficient notices to provide reasonable notice to interested persons.
(f) The planning staff shall take any other action deemed by the Planning Department
to be useful or appropriate to give notice of the public hearing on any proposed amendment.
(g) The notice required or authorized by this section (other than the posted notice
required by subsection (e)) shall: (AMENDED 11/24/09)
(1) State the date, time, and place of the public hearing.
(2) Summarize the nature and character of the proposed change.
(3) If the proposed amendment involves a change in zoning district
classification, reasonably identify the property whose classification would
be affected by the amendment.
(4) State that the full text of the amendment can be obtained from the town
clerk.
(5) State that substantial changes in the proposed amendment may be made
following the public hearing.
(h) The planning staff shall make every reasonable effort to comply with the notice
provisions set forth in this section. However, it is the Board’s intention that the notice requirements
set forth in this section that are not required by state law shall not be regarded as mandatory, and
therefore a failure to comply with such requirements shall not render any amendment invalid.
(AMENDED 11/24/09)
(i) Except for a town-initiated zoning map amendment, when an application is filed to
request a zoning map amendment and that application is not made by the owner of the parcel of
land to which the amendment would apply (regardless of how the staff treats the proposed
amendment under subsection 15-321(c)), the applicant shall certify to the Board of Aldermen that
the owner of the parcel of land as shown on the county tax listing has received actual notice of
the proposed amendment and a copy of the notice of public hearing. The person or persons
required to provide notice shall certify to the Board of Aldermen that proper notice has been
Art. XX AMENDMENTS
Page #5
provided in fact, and such certificate shall be deemed conclusive in the absence of
fraud. (AMENDED 11/24/09)
(j) Actual notice of the proposed amendment and a copy of the notice of public hearing
required under subsection 15-323(i) of this section shall be by any manner permitted under G.S.
1A-1, Rule 4(j). If notice cannot with due diligence be achieved by personal delivery, registered
or certified mail, or by a designated delivery service authorized pursuant to 26 U.S.C. §
7502(f)(2), notice may be given by publication consistent with G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4(j1). This
subsection applies only to an application to request a zoning map amendment where the
application is not made by the owner of the parcel of land to which the amendment would apply.
This subsection does not apply to a city-initiated zoning map amendment. (AMENDED
11/24/09)
Section 15-324 Board Action on Amendments (AMENDED 10/24/06)
(a) At the conclusion of the public hearing on a proposed amendment, the
Board may proceed to vote on the proposed ordinance, refer it to a committee for further
study, or take any other action consistent with its usual rules of procedure.
(b) The Board is not required to take final action on a proposed amendment
within any specific period of time, but it should proceed as expeditiously as practicable on
petitions for amendments since inordinate delays can result in the petitioner incurring
unnecessary costs.
(c) Voting on amendments to this chapter shall proceed in the same manner as
on other ordinances, subject to Section 15-326 of the Land Use Ordinance and Section 2-
15 of the Town Code.
(d) Prior to adopting or rejecting any zoning amendment, the Board shall adopt
one of the following statements which shall not be subject to judicial review (AMENDED
2/6/2018):
(1) A statement approving the zoning amendment and describing its
consistency with an adopted comprehensive plan and explaining why
the action taken is reasonable and in the public interest.
(2) A statement rejecting the zoning amendment and describing its
inconsistency with an adopted comprehensive plan and explaining why
the action taken is reasonable and in the public interest.
(3) A statement approving the zoning amendment and containing at least all
of the following:
a. A declaration that the approval is also deemed an amendment
to the comprehensive plan. The governing board shall not
require any additional request or application for amendment to
Art. XX AMENDMENTS
Page #6
the comprehensive plan.
b. An explanation of the change in conditions the governing board
took into account in amending the zoning ordinance to meet
the development needs of the community.
c. Why the action was reasonable and in the public interest.
(4) The Board retains the right to find a zoning amendment to be consistent
with any duly adopted plan, but to deny the zoning amendment request
(5) For the purposes of this section, "comprehensive plan" includes a
unified development ordinance and any other officially adopted
plan that is applicable.
(e) A Board member shall not vote on any zoning map or text amendment
where the outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a direct,
substantial, and readily identifiable financial impact on the member. (See also Carrboro
Town Code Section 2-35).
Section 15-325 Ultimate Issue Before Board on Amendments
In deciding whether to adopt a proposed amendment to this chapter, the central issue before
the Board is whether the proposed amendment advances the public health, safety or welfare. All
other issues are irrelevant, and all information related to other issues at the public hearing may be
declared irrelevant by the mayor and excluded. In particular, when considering proposed minor
map amendments:
(1) Except when the request is to rezone property to a conditional use district or
conditional zoning district, the Board shall not consider any representations made by
the petitioner that, if the change is granted, the rezoned property will be used for
only one of the possible range of uses permitted in the requested classification.
Rather, the Board shall consider whether the entire range of permitted uses in the
requested classification is more appropriate than the range of uses in the existing
classification. (AMENDED 05/25/99; 05/27/08)
(2) The Board shall not regard as controlling any advantages or disadvantages to the
individual requesting the change, but shall consider the impact of the proposed
change on the public at large.
Section 15-326 Citizen Comments on Zoning Map and Text Amendments (AMENDED
10/24/06, REWRITTEN 12/6/16).
The Town of Carrboro Land Use Ordinance may from time to time be amended,
supplemented, changed, modified or repealed. If any resident or property owner in the Town
submits a written statement regarding a proposed amendment, modification or repeal to this
Ordinance to the Clerk of the Board of Aldermen at least two (2) business days prior to the
proposed vote on such change, the Clerk to the Board shall deliver such written statement to the
Art. XX AMENDMENTS
Page #7
Board. If the proposed change is the subject of a quasi-judicial proceeding under North Carolina
General Statutes Section 160A-388 (such as conditional use rezoning in which the legislative
rezoning is accompanied by or followed by a quasi-judicial conditional use permit process), the
Clerk shall provide only the names and addresses of the individuals providing written comment,
and the provision of such names and addresses to all members of the Board shall not disqualify any
member of the Board from voting. Written statements submitted in connection with a quasi-judicial
proceeding may be admitted into evidence at such a proceeding if the Board determines that such
statements are admissible in the proceeding. (Amended 12-6-16 ; and enacted pursuant to a
Resolution in Opposition to the General Assembly’s Repeal of Statutory Authority for Qualified
Protest Petitions to Trigger a Super Majority Vote for Certain Zoning Map Amendments, dated
12-6-16).

Section 15-339 Certificates of Appropriateness.
(a) From and after the designation of an historic district, no exterior portion of any
building or other structure (including masonry walls, fences, light fixtures, steps and pavement,
or other appurtenant features) nor above-ground utility structures nor any type of outdoor
advertising signs shall be erected, altered, restored, moved or demolished within such district
until after an application for a certificate of appropriateness as to exterior features (as the terms is
defined in G.S. 160A-400.9) has been submitted to and approved by the historic district
commission. A certificate of appropriateness shall be issued by the commission prior to the
issuance of a building permit or other permit granted for the purposes of constructing, altering,
moving or demolishing structures, which certificate may be issued subject to reasonable
conditions necessary to carry out the purposes of this Part. A certificate of appropriateness shall
be required whether or not a building or other permit is required.
(b) The town and all public utility companies shall be required to obtain a certificate
of appropriateness before initiating any changes in the character of any street paving, sidewalks,
trees, or utility installations (including without limitation poles and lighting) located within an

take no action under this section except for the purpose of preventing the construction,
reconstruction, alteration, restoration, moving or demolition of buildings, structures, appurtenant
fixtures, outdoor advertising signs, or other significant features in the district which would be
incongruous with the special character of the district. Nor shall this part be construed to prevent
the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in an historic district
which does not involve a change in design, material or outer appearance thereof, nor to prevent
the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, moving or demolition of any such feature
which the building inspector shall certify is required by the public safety because of an unsafe or
dangerous condition.
(d) With respect to all aspects of administration, including without limitation notice
and hearing and enforcement requirements, the provisions of this chapter applicable to special
use permits issued by the board of adjustment shall apply to certificates of appropriateness issued
by the historic district commission.

(1) The commission may, by uniform rule in its Rules of Procedure, require
that an applicant submit all or any portion of the information required by
Appendix A for other permit applications, as well as additional
information reasonably necessary to make a determination on whether the
certificate of appropriateness should be issued. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the commission shall require that each
application be accompanied by such sketches, drawings, or photographs
that satisfactorily show, among other things, the scale of the proposed
building in relation to adjoining buildings, as well as specifications,
descriptions, or other information sufficient to clearly show the proposed
move, exterior alterations, additions, changes, new construction or
demolition.
(2) Nothing shall prevent the applicant from filing with the application
additional relevant information bearing on the application.
(3) An application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be reviewed and
acted upon within a reasonable time, not to exceed 180 days from the date
the application is filed.
(4) If the commission determines that a certificate of appropriateness should
not be issued, a new application affecting the same property may be
submitted only if substantial change is made in plans for the proposed
construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration or moving, or other
conditions related to the district or surrounding uses have been changed
substantially.
(e) An application for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the demolition of a
building or structure within the district may not be denied. However, the effective date of such a
certificate may be delayed by the historic district commission for a period of up to 180 days from
the date of approval. During such period the historic district commission may negotiate with the
owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the building. If the
historic district commission finds that the building has no particular significance or value toward
maintaining the character of the district, it shall waive all or part of such period and authorize
earlier demolition or removal.
(f) Except as provided in subsection (e), a certificate of appropriateness shall be
issued if the application complies with the guidelines adopted pursuant to Subsection 15-338(b)
and denied if the application does not comply.
(g) An appeal from the commission’s action in granting or denying a certificate of
appropriateness may be taken to the board of adjustment in the manner specified in Section 15-91
and subject to all the provisions applicable to appeals from decisions of the zoning administrator,

All applications for land use permits, variances, rezoning requests, zoning text
amendment applications, and other plans, including transportation plans, within an historic
district shall be reviewed by the historic district commission at its next regular meeting after the

Appendix A
INFORMATION REQUIRED WITH APPLICATIONS
A-1. In General.
(a) As provided in Section 15-49, it is presumed that all of the information
listed in this appendix must be submitted with an application for a zoning, sign, special use,
or conditional use permit to enable the permit-issuing authority to determine whether the
development, if completed as proposed, will comply with all the requirements of Chapter
15. As set forth in Section 15-92, applications for variances are subject to the same
provisions. However, the permit-issuing authority may require more information or accept
as sufficient less information according to the circumstances of the particular case. A
developer who believes information presumptively required by this appendix is unnecessary
shall contact the planning staff for an interpretation.
(b) As also provided in Section 15-49, the administrator shall develop
application processes, including standard forms, to simplify and expedite applications for
simple development that do not require the full range of information called for in this
appendix. In particular, developers seeking only permission to construct single-family
houses or duplexes or to construct new or modify existing signs should contact the
administrator for standard forms.
A-2. Written Applications.
Every applicant for a variance or a zoning, sign, special use or conditional use
permit shall complete a written application containing at least the following information:
(1) The name, address, and phone number of the applicant.
(2) If the applicant is not the owner of the property in question, (i) the name, address,
and phone number of the owner, and (ii) the legal relationship of the applicant to the
owner that entitles the applicant to make application.
(3) The date of the application.
(4) Identification of the particular permit sought.
(5) A succinct statement of the nature of the development proposed under the permit or
the nature of the variance.
(6) Identification of the property in question by street address and tax map reference.
(7) The zoning district within which the property lies.
APPEND. A -- INFORMATION REQUIRED WITH APPLICATIONS
PAGE A-2
(8) The number of square feet in the lot where the development is to take place.
(9) The gross floor area of all existing or proposed buildings located on the lot where
the development is to take place.
(10) If the proposed development is a multi-family residential development, the number
of one, two, three, or four bedroom dwelling units proposed for consideration.
A-3. Development Site Plans.
Subject to Section A-1 of this appendix, every application for a variance or a zoning,
sign, special use, or conditional use permit shall contain plans that locate the development
site and graphically demonstrate existing and proposed natural, man-made, and legal
features on and near the site in question, all in conformity with Section A-4 through A-6 of
this appendix.
A-4 Graphic Materials Required for Plans
(a) The plans shall include a location map that shows the location of the project
in the broad context of the town or planning jurisdiction. This location map may be drawn
on the development site plans or it may be furnished separately using reduced copies of
maps of the Carrboro planning jurisdiction available at the planning department.
(b) Development site plans shall be drawn to scale, using such a scale that all
features required to be shown on the plans are readily discernible. Very large developments
may require that plans show the development in sections to accomplish this objective
without resort to plans that are so large as to be cumbersome, or the objective may be
accomplished by using different plans or plans drawn to different scales to illustrate
different features. In all cases, the permit-issuing authority shall make the final
determination whether the plans submitted are drawn to the appropriate scale, but the
applicant for a conditional or special use permit rely in the first instance on the
recommendations of the administration.
(c) Development site plans should show on the first page the following
information:
(1) Name of applicant
(2) Name of development (if any)
(3) North arrow
(4) Legend

E-1 Guide for Protecting Existing Trees
Section 15-316 provides for the retention and protection of large trees when land is
developed. In order to better ensure the survival of existing trees, the developer should heed
the following guidelines:
(a) Protect trees with fencing and armoring (if needed) during the entire
construction period. The fence should enclose an area 1-1.5 feet x the diameter inches of
the tree to be retained. The area inside the fence should be off limits and no work should
take place inside the tree preservation zone. (REWRITTEN 06/24/14)
(b) Avoid excavations beneath the crown of the tree as required by Section
15-316(b).
(c) Avoid compaction of the soil around existing trees due to heavy equipment.
In areas where storage or vehicular access must take place within the tree preservation area
outlined above, a drivable mulch pad with ½” plywood on top may be used to protect the
tree’s root system, maintaining a minimum distance of 8’from the trunk.. Mulch should be
maintained at 12” depth. Preservation fencing should still be placed between the work zone
and the tree’s trunk. Trunk armoring may be needed when equipment will be used in close
proximity to the tree. (REWRITTEN 06/24/14)
(d) Keep fires or other sources of extreme heat well clear of existing trees.
(e) Damaged roots should be cleanly cut and covered with topsoil to prevent
drying. If damage to limbs or branches is anticipated in certain locations, pruning prior to
beginning work may be considered. Limbs and branches broken during the construction
process but still attached should be pruned to prevent further damage. An assessment should
be performed and corrective pruning may be necessary after construction has been completed
around the tree. Pruning / restoration work should be performed under the supervision of a
Certified Arborist. (REWRITTEN 06/24/14)
(f) As is stipulated in Section 15-316(b), no paving or other impermeable ground
cover should be placed within the dripline of trees to be retained. (REWRITTEN 06/24/14)
3
E-2 Standards for Street and Parking Lot Trees
Trees planted in compliance with the requirements of Sections 15-315 and 15-317
should have most or all of the following qualities. The trees recommended in Section E-10
represent the best combinations of these characteristics.
(a) Hardiness
(1) Resistance to extreme temperatures.
(2) Drought resistance.
(3) Resistance to storm damage.
(4) Resistance to air pollution.
(5) Ability to survive physical damage from human activity.
(b) Life Cycle
(1) Moderate to rapid rate of growth.
(2) Long life.
(c) Foliage and Branching
(1) Tendency to branch high above the ground.
(2) Wide spreading habit.
(3) Relatively dense foliage for maximum shading.
(d) Maintenance
(1) Resistance to pests.
(2) Resistance to plant diseases.
(3) Little or no pruning requirements.
(4) No significant litter problems.
(e) Flora Within Planting Strips (AMENDED 11/19/96)
(1) Match foliage size described in Section E-11 through E-16 with planting
strip size.

E-3 Formula for Calculating 35% Shading of Vehicle Accommodation
Areas (REWRITTEN 06/24/14)
Following is an elementary formula for determining the number of shade trees required in
and around parking lots in order to presumptively satisfy the shading requirements of Section
15-317.
1. Calculate square footage of the vehicle accommodation area. Include parking
spaces, driveways, loading areas, sidewalks, and other circulation areas. Do not
include building area and any area which will remain completely undeveloped: ______ sq. ft.
2. Multiply x .35
3. Areas to be shaded:
*************
Add:
______ sq. ft.
4. Area shaded by existing trees to be retained in and around the vehicle accommodation
area:* ______ sq. ft.
5. Area shaded by required screening trees, if any:* ______ sq. ft.
6. Area shaded by required street trees, if any:* ______ sq. ft.
7. Subtotal:
(if line #7 is greater than line #3, then the shading requirement has been met. If not,
go on to line #8)
______ sq. ft.
8. Enter the difference between line #7 and line #3: ______ sq ft.
9. Divide line #8: ÷ 707
10. Total number of shade trees required within the vehicle accommodation area: ______ trees
___________________________________
*Existing trees retained in compliance with Section 15-316 will be credited according to
their actual crown radius. Shaded area may be calculated as follows:
3.14 x (crown radius)2 = shaded area
Trees planted within the vehicle accommodation area are credited with shading 707 sq. ft. (Based
on a crown radius of 15) New or existing trees on the perimeter of the parking lot are credited for
having only half a crown over the vehicle accommodation area (e.g., new perimeter trees will be
credited for shading 354 sq. ft.). Generally, all trees planted in compliance with the screening
requirements of Article XIX, Part I and the street tree requirements of Section 15-315 will be
considered perimeter trees. When smaller trees such as Dogwoods are planted, the credited shading
area will be adjusted downward to 314 sq. ft. for interior trees and 157 sq. ft. for perimeter trees.
(Based on a crown radius of 10 ft.) (REWRITTEN 06/24/14)

When smaller trees such as Dogwoods are planted, the credited shading area will be adjusted
downward to 314 square feet for interior trees and 157 square feet for perimeter trees. (Based on a
crown radius of 10 feet.)

E-5 Guide for Planting Trees (REWRITTEN 06/24/14)
The trees recommended in Section E-10 have minimal maintenance requirements.
However, all trees must receive a certain degree of care, especially during and immediately after
planting. In order to protect an investment in new trees, the developer and his or her agents should
follow these guidelines in accordance with International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) Best
Practices, when planting:
(a) All plant material shall conform to the current American Standards for Nursery
Stock and must be free from injury, insect infestations and disease. Tree caliper at time of planting
should be 2-3”.
(b) The best times for planting are early spring and early fall, but may vary depending
upon tree species and site conditions. These factors must be considered when selecting species and
planting schedule. Trees planted in the summer run the risk of dehydration and precautions must be
taken to ensure establishment.
(c) Plant all trees at least three-and-a-half feet from the end of head-in parking spaces in
order to prevent damage from car overhang.
(d) Planting hole should be at least 2x the diameter of the root ball and not deeper than
the distance from the bottom of the root ball to the root flair, which may be hidden
beneath root ball soil. Excess soil above the root flair should be removed once the
tree is in place. The tree should be planted so that its root flair is just above
existing grade.
(e) Especially in areas where construction activity has compacted the soil, the sides of
the planting hole should be scarified or loosened with a pick ax or shovel.
(f) After the pit is dug, observe sub-surface drainage conditions. Most soils in the
Carrboro area are poorly drained. Planting depth where poor drainage exists should
be dependent upon the water needs of the tree species. If the species is more
sensitive to poor drainage, the tree should be planted higher than existing grade, not
to exceed ¼ root of the ball above grade. Back fill should then be sloped gradually
from top of root ball to existing grade. Gravel placed at the bottom of the hole will
not improve drainage.
(g) Backfill should include a proper mix of soil, peat moss and nutrients. All roots
must be completely covered. Backfill should be thoroughly watered as it is placed
around the roots.
(h) Staking the tree is not recommended unless necessary to stabilize the tree e.g., a lose
root ball, unstable bare root transplant, or large evergreen w/higher wind resistance. Staking a tree
unnecessarily can reduce the development of structural roots and proper trunk taper. If tree is to be
7
staked, it should be done so loosely and staking should be removed after the first year. Guying
materials should not girdle or cut into the bark.
(i) Mulch should be spread at a depth of 2-3 inches maximum, ideally extending to the
drip line. At a minimum, it should cover the entire excavation area in order to retain moisture and
help to prevent weeds. Mulch should not be allowed to touch the trunk as this will cause moisture
build up, increasing the chance of trunk decay. If necessary, on sloped locations, create a raised
ring on the downhill side of the slope to catch rain runoff.
(j) Trunk wrapping is not required but may be considered for certain species with thin
bark in certain locations. If wrap is to be used it should be light colored, biodegradable (paper) and
be wrapped from the bottom up. This will help to prevent moisture build up along the trunk.
(k) Conscientious post-planting care, especially watering, pruning and fertilizing, is a
must for street and parking lot trees. Minimal pruning should be performed during the first year, if
at all. Watering and fertilization rates are dependent upon site conditions.

E-9 Guide for Planting Shrubs
Shrubs planted for screening purpose should be given a proper culture and sufficient
room in which to grow. Many of the guidelines for tree planting listed in Section E-5 also
apply to shrubs. However, because specific requirements vary considerably between shrub
types, this Appendix does not attempt to generalize the needs of all shrubs. For detailed
planting information on individual species, refer to: Landscape Plants of the Southeast by
R. Gordon Halfacre and Anne R. Shawcroft. A copy of this book is available in the
Carrboro Planning Department or by contacting Sparks Press, P.O. Box 26747, Raleigh,
N.C. 27611.
E-10 Lists of Recommended Trees and Shrubs
The following lists indicate plantings which will meet the screening and shading
requirements of Article XIX of the Land Use Ordinance. The lists are by no means comprehensive
and are intended merely to suggest the types of flora which would be appropriate for
screening and shading purposes. Plants were selected for inclusion on these lists according to
four principal criteria: i.) general suitability for the Piedmont section of North Carolina; ii.)
hardiness/tolerance of city conditions; iii.) ease of maintenance; and iv.) availability from area
nurseries. When selecting new plantings for a particular site, a developer should first consider
the type of plants which are thriving on or near the site. Accordingly, species native to North
Carolina should often be favored. However, if an introduced species has proven highly effective
for screening or shading in Piedmont Towns, it too may be a proper selection.
The plantings marked with an (±) on the following lists are appropriate for planting within
plantings strips -- as defined under Section 15-216, Subsection (j).

E-11 Small Trees for Partial Screening (Amended 6/22/04)
The following trees are recommended for use in all types of screens. Though smaller than the trees listed in
planting lists E-12 and E-13, each of these trees will reach a height of at least 20 feet. Selections marked
with an (*) are also recommended as shade trees and may be credited for meeting the 20% shading
requirement for paved parking lots.
AMERICAN HOLLY (Ilex opaca) Height: 15-30’; Spread: 10-20’.
This familiar native tree possesses a pyramidal evergreen crown with abundant red berries in the winter. It
grows best in full sun and prefers moist yet well drained soils. If the lower limbs are allowed to grow
naturally, they will branch to the ground. Hollies should be protected from high winds. The American
Holly is a relatively slow grower.
AMERICAN HOP HORNBEAM (Ostryga virginiana) Height: 40 to 50 feet; Spread: 20 to 30 feet
Hophornbeam is a small short-lived understory tree in moist, well-drained forests. It has a slow to
medium growth rate on a great variety of soils. It develops a finely branched round crown and is an
attractive landscape tree that provides wildlife with a limited amount of seed. Fruit
*AMERICAN HORNBEAM (Carpinus carolinia) Height: 20-30’; Spread: 15-20’.
This native tree has a natural yet refined appearance. It is slow growing, but at maturity it serves as an
excellent small shade tree. Its fluted, “muscular” trunk is an interesting feature. In the wild, the American
Hornbeam is common in moist rich soil, yet, when used in landscape design, it is soil tolerant and does not
require an unusual amount of water. It has no pests and no special maintenance problems.
AMERICAN SMOKETREE (Cotinus obovatus) Height: 15 feet; Spread: 15 feet
Smoketree is a small tree found on upland sites. This tree is planted as an ornamental for the attractive
fruit that are presented on a feathery, hairy stalk, which gives a smoke-like appearance.
BLACK HAW (Viburnum prunifolium; V. dentatum) Height: 12 to 15 feet; Spread: 8 to 12 feet
Black Haw is a small tree with twisted trunk and arching branches with an overall round crown
appearance. Does best on partially sunny sites on moist, well-drained soils.
CAROLINA CHERRY-LAUREL (Prunus caroliniana) Height: 20-30’; Spread: 15-20’.
This tree is prized for its dense evergreen foliage. It may be trimmed as a hedge, but also serves as an
excellent screen in its natural form. The Cherry-Laurel grows rapidly and has no pests. However, it may
not be as cold hardy as other trees on this list.
CRABAPPLE, SOUTHERN (Malus) Height: 15’-30’; Spread 10-20’
Slow to moderate growers, with springtime flowers in colors ranging from pink to red to white. Birds are
fond of fruit. Care should be taken when choosing a specific variety to make certain that it is disease
resistant. Some disease resistant varieties include ‘Adams’, ‘Callaway’, and ‘Sentinel’.
16
EASTERN REDBUD (Cercis canadensis) Height: 20-30’; Spread: 12-25’.
This native tree is covered by beautiful pink flowers in the Spring and develops a dense round crown when
allowed to grow in direct sunlight. The Redbud has some pests, and its fruit pods may present a litter
problems, but it recommends itself by being drought resistant and tolerant of polluted city air.
*FLOWERING DOGWOOD (Cornus florida) height: 15-30’; Spread: 15-20’.
The Dogwood is a native woodland tree which is very popular for landscape planting. It is considered to be
a fairly hardy tree, but, when planted in direct sun, it must be frequently watered. A healthy Dogwood will
develop attractive horizontal branches and bushy crown. Dogwoods look best when planted in groups or
when used as an accent in borders. These trees should be guarded against borers and other pests.
FRINGE TREE (Chionanthus virginiana) Height: 12 to 20 feet; Spread:12 to 20 feet
Fringe-tree is a short trunk tree with a narrow, oblong crown found on moist soils. It is a popular
ornamental because of the white fringe-like drooping white flower clusters in May and June that mature
into inch-long blue-black fruit in September and October.
MOCK ORANGE (Philadelphius inodorus or other native cultivars) Height:3 to 6 feet; Spread: 3 to
9 feet
Mock Orange is a deciduous short shrub, suitable on a range of soil conditions along streams and bluffs,
cliffs, and rocky banks, with full sun to partial shade. Best used as part of a shrub border or an edge to
natural areas. Fragrant white flowers in spring on spreading branches that twist around each other and
arch to the ground.
PAW PAW(Asimina triloba) Height: 15 to 40 feet; Spread: 15 to 30 feet
Pawpaw is an understory species found on moist, well-drained sites that has a tropical appearance in the
landscape. Purplish-brown, broad bell shape flowers appear with or slightly before the leaves. Fall
ripening fruit resemble a short, fat banana, that is very fleshy, tastes like a banana, and eaten by squirrel,
fox, raccoon and small animals.
SERVICEBERRY (Amelanchier canadenis) Height: 10’-20’; Spread 8-15’
An upright shaped tree with a moderate growth rate. Serviceberry will thrive in sun or partial shade. White
springtime flowers. Tolerant of most soil types, Serviceberry looks good planted along the edge of woods.
SOURWOOD (Oxyndrum arboreum) Height: 20-30’; Spread: 10-15’.
Sourwoods are handsome native trees which are most effective in landscape design when planted in
groups. They are easy to transplant and as each tree matures it assumes a slender form with upright
branches. Sourwood prefers relatively dry acid soils. Its only special maintenance problems may be
infestations of webworms.
WASHINGTON HAWTHORN (Crataegus phaenophyrum) Height: 25-30’; Spread: 25-30’.
Hawthorns generally require spraying to prevent disease and insect infestation. However, they are an
excellent choice for screening because of their extremely dense and thorny branches. They have proven to
be excellent as a headlight screen on highway medians and, when planted close together, they form an
17
impenetrable living fence. They prefer sun and are tolerant to most types of soil. The Washington
Hawthorn is generally considered to be the best of the Hawthorns.
YAUPON (Ilex vomitoria) Height: 15 to 20 feet; Spread: 10 to 20 feet
Yaupon is an upright evergreen shrub that forms thickets with numerous stems and branches. It grows
well in full to partial shade and adapted to wet and dry sites. Small white flowers in spring yield to
small shiny red berry clusters on the stems in the fall. Deer browse the foliage and fruit are eaten by
birds and small mammals.
18
E-12 Large Trees for Evergreen Screening (Amended 6/22/04)
The following trees are ideal for screening large scale areas such as shopping centers and industrial
sites. They are also effective in combination with other, smaller screening plants. All three are moderate to
fast growers. They are not considered to be shade trees.
ATLANTIC WHITE CEDAR (Chamaecyparis thyoides) Height: 40 to 50; Spread 10 to 20 feet
Atlantic White Cedar is a tall, slender columnar tree; that looses lower branches with age. It grows best
in wet sites with full sun. Bluish green needles appear flattened and arranged in irregular sprays with
pointed tips. Bluish purple cones are quarter-inch long.
EASTERN RED CEDAR (Juniperus virginiana) - Height 60’; Spread 15-20’.
This is a native evergreen tree that is very hardy in the area. Mature specimens have interesting bark. Has
waxy fruit that birds enjoy. Slow growth.
LAUREL OAK (Quercus laurifolia) Height: 40-60’; Spread: 30’+.
The Laurel Oak grows more slowly than the other Oaks listed above, but it has the advantage of being
nearly evergreen in Piedmont sections of North Carolina. It has proven to be a good street tree and does
quite well under city conditions. It presents no special maintenance problems.
LOBLOLLY PINE (Pinus taeda) - Height 50 to 90; Spread 30 to 40 feet
Loblolly pine grows well on moderately acid soils with poor surface drainage and full sun. It is initially
pyramidal until the crown becomes rounded with horizontal branches following the loss of lower
branches. Excellent fast growing species for rapid vegetative screening.
LONGLEAF PINE (Pinus palustris) - Height 80 to 100; Spread 30 to 40 feet
Longleaf pine is found on well-drained sandy soils and on swamp edges and requires full sun. In the
Piedmont, it rarely attains mature height due to susceptibility to ice storm damage, wind, lightning, high
winds, and drought. It is also a nesting tree for red-cockaded woodpecker. It is slow to establish and
grows in "grass like" stage for first 5 years.
SHORTLEAF PINE (Pinus echinata) Height 80 to 100; Spread 30 feet
Shortleaf pine is a medium-sized, native, evergreen conifer with relatively short needles and thin, flaky,
black bark that becomes reddish brown with age. Shortleaf pine is suitable to sunny sites and a variety
of soils. It is a medium to large tree with an initial small, open, pyramidal crown that becomes a small
narrow crown with age.
SOUTHERN MAGNOLIA (Magnolia grandiflora) Height: 40-60’; Spread: 25’+.
Magnolias are striking trees which serve well as screens when their branches are allowed to grow to the
ground. Generally, the tree does well in city conditions, but it should be planted in quite rich acidic soils
19
and it requires a lot of moisture. Furthermore, Magnolias require ample space for growth. If planted in full
sunlight, they will grow rapidly. Because it drops large waxy leaves, seed pods, and flowers, the Magnolia
may present a litter problem.
VIRGINIA PINE (Pinus virginiana) - Height 60’; Spread 25-35’.
A native of the area, Virginia Pine is a short needled tree that is very tolerant of clay soils. More resistant
to winter weather conditions than Loblolly Pine.
20
E-13 Large Trees for Shading (Amended 6/22/04)
The following trees may be used for screening, but they are recommended especially for shading
streets and parking lots. Unless otherwise noted, they will grow rapidly. Each species will attain a mature
spread of at least thirty feet. The trees on the following list marked with an “*” are appropriate selections
to satisfy Section 15-315, Required Trees Along Dedicated Streets.
CHESTNUT OAK (Quercus montana; Q. prinus) Height: 60 to 70 feet; Spread: 50 to 70 feet
Chestnut oak is a medium-sized, native, deciduous, tree that is suited to dry, infertile, rocky upland sites,
yet grows best on rich well-drained soils along streams. At maturity, it is a medium-sized long-lived tree
with an irregular dense crown. The sweet acorns are an important food for many wildlife species
including deer, turkeys, squirrels, chipmunks, and mice, while small birds, mammals, and bees use
chestnut oak cavities for nesting
CUCUMBER TREE (Magnolia acuminata; M. Fraserii) Height: 50 to 80 feet; Spread: 50 to 80 feet
Cucumber tree is the most widespread and hardiest of the eight native magnolia species. It grows fairly
rapidly and well in rich, moist soils of slopes and valleys and matures in 80 to 120 years. This park-like
tree is planted as an ornamental for its attractive leaves, flowers, and cucumber-shaped fruit, producing
seeds that are eaten by birds and small mammals. Its shape is pyramidal when young, developing a
straight trunk and a rounded crown.
*EASTERN RED OAK (Quercus rubra) Height: 50-70’; Spread: 40’+.
This tree grows faster than any other Oak, two feet or more per year. It is prized as a street tree because its
high branching habit gives it an ideal shape. The Red Oak grows in almost any average soil and presents
no special maintenance problems.
*GINKGO OR MAIDENHAIR TREE (Ginkgo biloba) Height: 40-80’; Spread: 30’+.
The Ginkgo is a tree which is recommended for several outstanding reasons. It is one of the oldest
surviving species of trees. It is adaptable to any soil, climate, or degree of exposure to the sun. It does
quite well in the city. It has no pests, no diseases, and no pruning requirements. In sum, it is a tree of
exceptional vitality. The N.C. Department of Forest Resources calls the Ginkgo, probably the best all
around street tree. Two reservations are worth stating, however. First, only male trees should be planted
because female Ginkgos bear a messy, malodorous fruit. Second, the Ginkgo is a slow grower. When
young, it has a rather gangly appearance. It takes 20 to 30 years to assume its mature, symmetrically
spreading form.
*LAUREL OAK (Quercus laurifolia) Height: 40-60’; Spread: 30’+.
The Laurel Oak grows more slowly than the other Oaks listed above, but it has the advantage of being
nearly evergreen in Piedmont sections of North Carolina. It has proven to be a good street tree and does
quite well under city conditions. It presents no special maintenance problems.
21
POST OAK (Quercus stellata) Height: 40 to 50 feet; Spread: 35 to 50 feet
Post oak is a small to medium-sized tree with a crown that has snarled and twisted branches and found
on upland sites with full sun. This slow-growing drought resistant oak typically occupies rocky or sandy
ridges and dry woodlands with a variety of soils. Acorns provide high-energy wildlife food during fall
and winter for wild turkey, white-tailed deer, and squirrels, and provide habitat for birds and mammals.
Post oak can be a beautiful shade tree for parks and to stabilize soil on dry, sloping, stony sites where
few other trees will grow. It develops an attractive crown with strong horizontal branches.
*SCARLET OAK (Quercu Coccinea) Height: 60-80’; Spread: 40’+.
This is a third Oak which grows rapidly and is easy to maintain. The Scarlet Oak is more difficult to
transplant than the Red or the Willow, but it may be a worthwhile selection for its excellent foliage
SOUTHERN CATALPA (Catalpa bignonoides) Height:25 to 40 feet; Spread: 20 to 30 feet
Catalpa is a medium-sized tree with spreading branches, an irregular crown, and generally crooked bole
that is suited to moist, well-drained soils with full sun. The flowers and leaves make this an interesting
landscape tree but the fruit can be messy.
SOUTHERN SUGAR MAPLE (Acer saccharum; A. barbatum) Height: 20 to 25 feet; Spread: 20 to
40 feet
Sugar maple grows on moist, well-drained soils and is very tolerant of shade. Seeds are eaten by birds
and small animals. A popular ornamental for the fall color, Sugar Maple at maturity is a medium to tall
tree with very dense elliptical crown.
SWAMP CHESTNUT OAK (Quercus michauxii) Height: 60 to 70 feet; Spread: 50 to 70 feet
Swamp chestnut oak grows in full sun on moist and wet loamy soils of bottomlands, along streams and
borders of swamps, tolerates saturated or flooded soils for a few days to a few weeks. The acorns are
sweet and serve as food to wildlife. The crown is round, compacted, and narrow.
SWAMP WHITE OAK (Quercus bicolor) Height: 50 to 60 feet; Spread: 50 to 60 feet
Swamp white oak is a medium sized tree with an irregular crown suitable to river bottomlands,
depressions, swamp borders, and along edges of streams. It is rapid growing and long lived, attaining
300 to 350 years. Many kinds of wildlife eat the acorns, particularly ducks. Swamp white oak is
intermediate in shade tolerance but not very drought tolerant.
SYCAMORE (Platanus occidentalis) Height: 70-100’; Spread: 60’+.
The Sycamore is probably the fastest growing shade tree on this list. Within ten years, it can grow to a
height of between thirty and forty feet. It is easily transplanted, but it needs plenty of space. As one of
nature’s most massive trees, Sycamores have been known to grow to a height of 170 feet with a trunk 10
feet across. The Sycamore is a native tree which typically grows in flood plains, but it thrives in a variety
of situations. Its tolerance of severe conditions has long made it a favorite choice as a street tree.
Sycamores are susceptible to fungi and leaf blight and their large leaves and seed balls may present a litter
problem.
22
*TULIP POPLAR (Liriodendron tulipifera) - Height 60’-150’; Spread 30-40’.
Very common in eastern woodlands, this is a rapidly growing tree with colorful yellow leaves in Fall.
Spring flowers, however, are not very noticeable. Difficult to transplant except when young. Excellent
street tree.
WHITE OAK (Quercus alba) Height: 60 to 100 feet; Spread:50 to 90 feet
White oak is found on fertile, moist, well-drained soils under partial sun. Acorns are eaten by game
birds, deer, bear, and many small mammals. Pyramidal in youth, this species matures into a rugged,
irregular crown that is wide spreading, with a stocky bole. While this species is potentially valuable for
use in reforestation projects, it is not recommended near paved areas.
*WILLOW OAK (Quercus phellos) Height: 60-80’; Spread: 30’+.
This is another rapidly growing Oak. It has proven to be quite successful as a street and parking lot tree in
the Carrboro area. Its slender leaves give it a finer texture than that of other Oaks, but it still casts excellent
shade. The Willow Oak is native to bottomland soils, and thus it needs plenty of moisture. It often spreads
majestically as it matures so it should be given ample room to grow. No significant pests or diseases afflict
the Willow Oak.
23
E-14 Small Shrubs for Evergreen Screening (Amended 6/22/04)
The following shrubs are recommended for informal (unclipped) hedges or screens. Each species
grows to a height of less than six feet; therefore, these shrubs are appropriate for Semi-Opaque Screens.
CAROLINA JESSAMINE* (Gelsemium sempervirens) - Height up to 20’; Spread varies.
A moderate growing, mostly evergreen vine that grows very well on fences. Fragrant yellow flowers in
springtime. Prefers sun or partial shade. All parts of this plant are poisonous.
CONVEXA JAPANESE HOLLY (Ilex crenata ‘convexa’) Height: 4-6’; Spread: 3-5’.
The Convexa Japanese Holly is another good Boxwood substitute. This shrub is considered to be one of
the most attractive, hardy and serviceable Hollies for landscape use. It is attractive in either a clipped or
unclipped form. It grows faster than the Littleleaf Japanese Holly.
DWARF HORNED HOLLY (Ilex cornuta ‘rotunda’) Height: 3’; Spread: 3-4’.
This shrub is an excellent selection for a low hedge. It is soil tolerant and requires no pruning or other
special care once established. With its spiny leaves, this plant appears to be and is in fact rugged. Like all
Hollies, it grows best in full sun, but unlike others of its species, it produces bright red berries without both
sexes being present.
GLOSSY ABELIA (Abelia grandiflora) Height: 4-6’; Spread: 3-5’.
Abelia is quite common in local nurseries and tends to be less expensive than other shrubs on this list. It
bears pale pink flowers throughout the summer. Although it has proven quite popular for informal hedges,
it has several drawbacks. Abelia should be pruned and thinned to maintain its best form. It may drop its
leaves due to low temperatures, lack of pruning, or starvation.
INDIAN HAWTHORN (Raphiolepis indica) Height: 3-4’; Spread: 4-5’.
With its spreading, irregular branching, the India Hawthorn makes an excellent informal hedge. It is
tolerant of a variety of soils and is fairly drought resistant. However, it may not be as cold tolerant and pest
resistant as other shrubs on this list.
JAPANESE YEW (Taxus cuspidata) Height: 4-6’; Spread: 5-7’.
The versatile Yew is commonly available from local nurseries in a wide variety of sizes and shapes. The
Japanese Yew serves as excellent screening material in either a clipped or unclipped form. It tolerates poor
growing conditions and flourishes in almost any kind of soil. (Soggy soil may hamper its growth,
however.) It is comparatively pest free and is hardy under trying winter conditions. The Yew’s best feature
is its rich shiny green needles which grow densely on all varieties.
OTTO LUKEYN LAUREL (Prunus laurocerasus var. ‘Otto Lukeyn’) - Height 4’; Spread 4-7’.
A cold hardy, broad leaved evergreen shrub. Prefers sun, but will grow in fairly shady conditions. Good
green color even in winter. This is a shorter growing variety of the Schipka Laurel.
24
POET’S LAUREL (Danae racemosa) Height: 2 to 3 feet; Spread: 2 to 3 feet
Poet’s Laurel prefers partial to full shade, moist, well-drained soil enriched with organic matter; but does
tolerate clay soils. It has an open growth habit with slender branches that arch up and away from center
of crown. It can spread by rhizomes. While foliage discolors in sun; it can be long-lasting for flower
arrangements.
TRUMPET HONEYSUCKLE* (Lonicera sempervirens) - Height up to 50’; Spread varies.
A rapid growing, mostly evergreen vine with beautiful orange to red to yellow flowers occurring in late
spring and throughout the summer. Best in full sun.
WARTY BARBERRY (Berberis verruculosa) Height: 3-4’; Spread: 3-4’.
Barberrys as a group have proven to be excellent as hedge plants. With their dense, spiny limbs, they are
effective barriers in public places. The Warty Barberry is a shrub with a neat, compact habit. It is soil
tolerant and has no special maintenance requirements. It grows slowly, but it will reach a height of 3 to 4
feet within five years.
WINTERBERRY HOLLY (Ilex verticillata) Height: 6 to 15 feet; Spread:6 to 10 feet
With a slow to moderate growth rate, this species is suited to partial to full sun on moist soils, but can
tolerate drought. Early summer brings small white flowers that mature into dense clusters of bright red
berries.
WINTERGREEN BARBERRY (Berberis julianae) Height: 4-6’; Spread: 2-5’.
This is another Barberry which forms an impenetrable thorny hedge. In fact, it grows even more densely
than the Warty Barberry. It is pest resistant and is very hardy. No pruning is required. Because it is fairly
slow growing, it will take eight to ten years to reach a height of 5 to 6 feet.
Note: * Vines - which if grown on a trellis would make a nice evergreen screen.
25
E-15 Large Shrubs for Evergreen Screening (Amended 6/22/04)
The following shrubs are recommended for high hedges or screens. Each species grows to a height
of more than 6 feet; therefore, these shrubs are appropriate for Opaque Screens.
ANISE BUSH (Illicium anisatum) - Height 8-12’; Spread 8-10’.
moderate growing, evergreen shrub with an open habit. Small flowers appear in mid-Summer. Prefers a
fair amount of moisture, with partial to full sun. Subject to damage during very cold winters.
CAROLINA CHERRY-LAUREL (Prunus caroliniana) Height: 20-30’; Spread: 15-20’.
This tree is prized for its dense evergreen foliage. It may be trimmed as a hedge, but also serves as an
excellent screen in its natural form. The Cherry-Laurel grows rapidly and has no pests. However, it may
not be as cold hardy as other trees on this list.
CLEYERA (Cleyera japonica) - Height 8-10’; Spread 5-6’.
A slow-moderate growing evergreen shrub. Its new foliage is reddish in color, like the Photinia.
However, unlike the Photinia, Cleyera is much more disease resistant and thus a better option. Prefers
shade or partial shade, with moist, but well drained soil.
ENGLISH LAUREL (Prunus laurocerasus) - Height 10-12’; Spread 8-11’.
A large leaved, evergreen shrub with moderate growth. Prefers well drained soils. Grows best in sun or
partial shade, but will survive in shade. Cold hardy. Makes an excellent evergreen screen.
FORTUNE TEA OLIVE (Osmanthus fortunei) Height: 9-12’; Spread: 5-7’.
This Osmanthus hybrid is a popular, though non-descript, shrub. With its vigorous growth, it will form an
excellent screen or border. It is soil tolerant. The Fortune Tea Olive is most notable for its inconspicuous
yet highly fragrant flowers.
LOBLOLLY BAY (Gordonia lasianthus) Height 30 to 60 feet; Spread 10 to 15 feet
Loblolly-bay is a small to medium-sized native, evergreen tree that grows on acid soils in flat woodlands
or shallow depressions with little or no slope, slow runoff, and poor to very poor drainage. It has a
narrow crown and straight trunk.
LOROPETALUM (Loropetalum chinese) - Height 6-10’; Spread 8-9’.
Fast growing evergreen shrub with colorful Spring flowers. Prefers sun or partial sun, in moist, but well
drained soil. Excellent substitute for Photinia. Variety ‘rubrum’ has purplish leaves.
RED BAY (Persea borbonia) Height: 15 to 40 feet; Spread 10 to 20 feet
Redbay is an attractive aromatic evergreen tree suitable for sites with partial to full sun and prefers drier
soils. Birds and small mammals eat the fruit.
26
SCHIPKA LAUREL (Prunus laurocerasus ‘schipkaensis’) - height 6-8’; spread 3-5’.
A cold hardy, broad leaved evergreen shrub. Prefers sun, but will grow in fairly shady conditions. Good
winter color.
SOUTHERN WAX MYRTLE (Myrica cerifera) Height 40 feet; Spread 20 to 25 feet
Southern wax myrtle is an erect, shade tolerant, ornamental, evergreen, small tree or shrub. Its flat leaves
are aromatic when crushed and may repel. Underground runners extend the growth laterally and root
nodules are capable of atmospheric nitrogen fixation.
YAUPON HOLLY (Ilex vomitoria) Height: 5-15’; Spread: 6-12’.
This is another versatile Holly, slower growing than the Burford, but equally as adaptable to adverse
conditions. It is a native shrub which has proven to be one of the most drought resistant of all Hollies. It
may be clipped to maintain any desired height. The Yaupon Holly is very heavily fruited and will attract
birds.
27
E-16 Assorted Plantings for Broken Screens (Amended 6/22/04)
The following is a sampling of shrubbery which would be appropriate in a Broken Screen. Because
many of these plants are deciduous, they are not suitable for Opaque and Semi-Opaque Screens. (Note:
Many of the evergreen shrubs described in planting lists E-14 and E-15 are also suitable for Broken
Screens.)
AZALEAS (Rhododendron calendulaceum (Flame); R. nudiflora & R. periclymenoides
(Pinxterbloom); R. prunifoloium (Plumleaf)) Height 3 to 10 feet; Spread 4 to 8 feet.
These three azaleas are excellent naturalizing plants that do not require a lot of space. With great orange,
pink, and red colors, these species attract hummingbirds and butterflies. Good for sites with full sun to
part shade with medium moisture on well-drained soils with a southwest aspect.
BEAUTYBERRY (Callicarpa americana) - Height 6’.
Very colorful deciduous shrub with springtime flowers, followed by purple fruit which lasts into winter.
Prefers full sun.
*BLUEBERRY (Vaccinium ashei) - Height 4-6’; Spread 3-5’.
Also known as Rabbiteye blueberry, this is a heat tolerant, native shrub. White flowers in springtime
followed by blue fruits that birds enjoy. Has a moderate growth rate. This shrub prefers well drained,
acid soil.
*BORDER FORSYTHIA (Forsythia intermedia) Height: 8-10’; Spread: 7- 10’.
Forsythias are well known shrubs which bloom bright yellow quite early in the Spring. There are two
commonly available forms of this shrubs: the weeping Forsythia suspensa and the more upright Forsythia
intermedia. The latter is preferred for screening purposes. With its graceful branches, the Border Forsythia
presents a good deciduous foliage mass and should be given plenty of room to grow. It transplants easily
and withstands poor growing conditions. It should be thinned occasionally to ensure vigorous growth.
BUTTON BUSH (Cephalanthus occidentalis) Height: 6 to 10 feet Spread: 6 to 10 feet
Buttonbush is a deciduous, warm-season, tall shrub or small tree that grows along swamps, marshes,
bogs, ditches, and other riparian areas that are seasonally inundated for at least part of the year. Its base
is often swollen, with green branches when young but turns brown at maturity. Tiny, white flowers
occur in dense, spherical clusters at branch ends attract bees and butterflies with fruits arranged in a
round cluster of brown, cone-shaped nutlets.
CAROLINA ALLSPICE OR SWEETSHRUB (Calycanthus floridus) - Height 6-9’; Spread 5-8’.
This is a deciduous shrub native to the Southeast. Fragrant, maroon flowers appear in late Spring.
Takes sun or shade.
CAROLINA ROSE (Rosa carolina) Height 3 to 6 feet Spread: 5 to 10 feet
Best grown in average, medium-wet to wet, well-drained soil in full sun. Fragrant, showy flowers attract
birds and butterflies, but this plant does have thorns.
28
CLETHRA (Clethra alnifolia) - Height 10’.
Another native of the Eastern United States, Clethra has fragrant white flowers in late Summer. Grows
well in acid soils. Full sun, however in the Piedmont it would do best with some shade. Varieties are
available with pink flowers.
COMMON WITCH HAZEL (Hamamelis virginiana) Height: 8-15’; Spread 7-14’.
This shrub is a larger version of Vernal Witch Hazel with many of the same qualities. It is another native
woodland plant which has adapted well to landscaping uses. The Common Witch Hazel is recommended
for shady areas, but when planted in the sun it grows to be a splendid well rounded specimen. It is
especially useful in large areas.
DROOPING LEUCOTHOE (Leucothoe fontanesiana) Height: 3-4’; Spread: 4-6’.
Drooping Leucothoe is a moundlike shrub which is good for planting in front of and between other flora
and beneath trees. It is hardy in city conditions and gives a natural effect when planted along borders. This
native evergreen is graceful and attractive in all seasons. It is easy to transplant but requires a heavy mulch
and should be provided with at least partial shade. Old branches should be pruned occasionally to stimulate
new growth.
FRINGETREE (Chioanthus virginicus) Height: 10-30’; Spread: 8-10’.
The Fringetree is known for its profusion of beautiful flowers. It is considered to be one of the most
striking native American shrubs. It is relatively difficult to transplant, but once established it does well in
cities as it endures heavy smoke and dust. The mature Fringetree’s only drawback is that its leaves appear
rather late in the Spring.
JAPANESE BARBERRY (Berberis thunbergii) Height: 3-5’; Spread: 3- 5’.
This extremely common deciduous shrub is considered to be one of the toughest members of the Barberry
family. It survives drought, poor soils, exposures, and the worst city conditions. With its many thorns, the
Japanese Barberry is often used as an impenetrable barrier, but it is attractive enough to stand alone as a
specimen plant. It requires no special maintenance and,when planted singularly, needs no pruning.
JAPANESE FLOWERING APRICOT (Prunus mume) - Height 15’ (tree).
Deciduous tree with small, but profuse flowers that have a spicy fragrance. Blooms in February or
March. Varieties are available with pink, red, or white flowers. Prefers full sun or partial shade.
OAKLEAF HYDRANGEA (Hydrangea quercifolia) - Height 4-6’; Spread 3-5’.
Deciduous shrub with large, white flower clusters during the Summer. Colorful crimson foliage in Fall.
Makes an excellent specimen plant.
SMOKETREE (Cotinus coggygria) - Height 10-15’; Spread 8-14’.
Large shrub or small deciduous tree with attractive round leaves. Colorful lavender panicles appear in
Summer. Prefers well drained soil, but otherwise does well in poor soils. Full sun is best for this shrub.
29
STAR MAGNOLIA (Magnolia stellata) Height: 10-12’; Spread: 8-10’.
This handsome specimen shrub is considered to be the hardiest of all the Magnolias. It forms a broad,
rounded mass. It becomes tree-like with age but continues to branch to the ground. Early in the spring, it
produces numerous fragrant white flowers. The Star Magnolia should not be planted adjacent to shallow
rooting trees. It should be allowed plenty of sun.
SUMAC (Rhus copallina (Shining); R. glabra (Smooth) R. typhina (Staghorn)) Height 7 to 40
feet; Spread 9 to 20 feet
These species are perennial, deciduous, sun-loving, thicket-forming shrubs or small trees with branches
that tend to be fairly sparse and stout. Sumac does well on dry to medium moisture sites. The tart fruits
are eaten by birds and are very tart in taste. These species provide good fall color.
**** SWAMP WHITE OAK (Quercus bicolor) Height: 50 to 60 feet; Spread: 50 to 60 feet
Swamp white oak is a medium sized tree with an irregular crown suitable to river bottomlands,
depressions, swamp borders, and along edges of streams. It is rapid growing and long lived, reaching
300 to 350 years. Many kinds of wildlife eat the acorns, particularly ducks. Swamp white oak is
intermediate in shade tolerance but not very drought tolerant.
VERNAL WITCH HAZEL (Hamamelis vernalis) Height: 4-6’; Spread: 2- 3’.
This rapidly growing native shrub is excellent for bordering and naturalizing. It assumes a dense, upright
form, thriving in even the most polluted air. Other than plenty of watering, the Vernal Witch Hazel
requires no special maintenance.
****Viburnum (Viburnum prunifolium; V. dentatum) Height: 12 to 15 feet; Spread: 8 to 12 feet
Black Haw is a small tree with twisted trunk and arching branches with an overall round crown
appearance. Does best on partially sunny sites on moist, well-drained soils.

APPENDIX G
METHOD FOR CALCULATING POINT VALUES FOR ACTIVE
RECREATION FACILITIES
(AMENDED 10/06/87)
The procedure described in Sections (1) to (4) below shall be used in order to determine the
value, in recreation points, of any active recreation facilities not already listed in the table of
facilities and their point per square foot values included in Section 15-196(b). Whenever such
calculations are completed for a new type of facility, that facility type and its associated recreation
point value shall be added to the list in Section 15- 196(b).
(1) Determine the normal or typical size, in square feet, of the facility in question. This
area should include necessary runoff and/or approach areas, in addition to the space required for the
facility itself. For example, the estimated space for a basketball court includes the court itself, and
adequate sideline and baseline areas.
(2) If the facility is made up of two or more substantial improved surfaces with a wide
disparity of costs, and where one of the surfaces can vary widely in size in relation to the other, then
for the purpose of estimating recreation points the facility should be artificially subdivided into two
facilities, one for each improved surface. An example of this is the case of a swimming pool and
swimming pool patio, which have separate recreation point values called out in Section 15-196(b).
(3) Determine both the land cost for the facility and the facility's construction cost in
$1985. During years after 1985, the construction cost component in $1985 is to be calculated by
determining the cost in current year's dollars, and adjusting it to $1985 using the annual Consumer
Price Index figures for years between the current year and 1985. During years after 1985, the land
cost component in $1985 shall be determined by multiplying the total facility land area defined in
(1) above by $0.75 per square foot. Add together the land and facility construction costs so
calculated, to determine the total cost of the facility in $1985.
(4) Divide the total cost of the facility calculated in (3) above by the total square feet
calculated in (1) above to obtain the facility's cost per square foot. Then divided that per square foot
cost by 100 to arrive at points per square foot.

TOWN OF CARRBORO
STORM DRAINAGE DESIGN MANUAL
by:
SUNGATE DESIGN GROUP, P.A.
TOWN OF CARRBORO
Storm Drainage Design Manual Page #1
GENERAL DESIGN STANDARDS AND POLICIES
1. STREET AND LOCAL DRAINAGE
Discharge estimates for specified design storms shall be calculated assuming full
development of the contributing watershed based on current zoning or on existing
development whichever is greater. Routing of discharges through lakes, ponds, or other
impoundments is not acceptable unless the impoundment is publicly owned and operated
as a permanent discharge control structure. Diversions of stormwater flow are not
acceptable. The Town Engineer must approve any diversion of stormwater, which cannot
be avoided.
For review, copies of topographic maps or the equivalent, clearly showing the
limits of the site, shall be submitted with the plans. These maps shall extend a minimum
of 1000 feet beyond the site boundaries. All off-site drainage areas shall be shown on the
topographic maps. All calculations used to compute runoff and storm drainage systems,
culvert and detention designs shall be submitted for review.
2. STORM DRAINAGE SYSTEM
All street and local drainage systems, which collect and transport stormwater
runoff from the street to an outlet should be designed to pass the 10-year design storm
unless more stringent requirements apply. Catch basins in streets shall be designed for
spread using the 2-year storm provided a 5-minute time of concentration is used and the
remainder of the system is designed for the 10-year storm. For computation of spread, a
4-inch per hour intensity (as allowed by NCDOT) may be used in lieu of the 2-year storm
with minimum 5-minute intensity. Inlet capacity at sags shall allow for potential debris
blockage by providing twice the required computed opening.
All storm drainage systems shall be analyzed to establish the hydraulic grade line.
The hydraulic grade line shall be at least 0.5’ below the top of the inlet grate. Each storm
drainage structure shall also be checked for inlet control. The recommended HW/D ratio
is 1.5 or less. The occurrence of pressure flow in storm drainage systems is not
recommended. If pressure flow in the system is proposed, a thorough analysis of pressure
flow in the system will be required. In addition the joints in the system will be
constructed to withstand the projected pressure without leaking.
No more than 3 cubic feet per second (cfs) shall be discharged over the curb and
into the street at any one point and spread shall be checked at that point.
TOWN OF CARRBORO
Storm Drainage Design Manual Page #2
No concentrated flow shall be discharged across walkways. Provisions are to be
made to pipe the flow under the walkway.
No pipe shall should be longer than 400 feet without some type structure providing
access.
All structures shall allow for access to the storm drainage system with a grate,
manhole ring and cover, or lid capable of being removed without mechanical equipment.
No “blind boxes” are permitted.
Curb inlets in the roadway should be placed in such a way that the spread of water
in the 2-year storm does not exceed one half of a lane width. When the typical section
includes a full shoulder or parking lane, no spread encroachment into the travel lane will
be allowed.
Inlets should be provided at sags, up-grade of intersections, up-grade of superelevation
crossovers, and where driveways would discharge more than 3 cfs into a street.
A minimum gutter gradient of 0.3 percent shall be utilized. When lesser gutter
slopes are encountered (such as at sags), the gutter shall be warped to provide the
minimum slope.
NCDOT type E, F, and G (bicycle) grate inlets are allowed in streets. Grates shall
be oriented to capture flow.
When development of an area changes the flow regime from sheet flow to
concentrated flow, the drainage system should be designed to minimize impacts of the
concentrated flow on adjacent properties by tying into existing systems, providing
detention, using multiple outlets through agreements with adjacent owners, or other
appropriate means.
Minimum drops in inlets, junction boxes and other structures shall be designed and
constructed to NCDOT standards.
Where storm drainage lines cross or parallel other utility lines, appropriate
clearances shall be provided as required by the appropriate utility or local, state or federal
agencies.
A manhole, inlet junction box or other structure allowing for access shall be
required at all changes in grade or direction or at any pipe junction. Details shall be
provided on the plans for all such structures.
TOWN OF CARRBORO
Storm Drainage Design Manual Page #3
3. CULVERTS
All culverts (conduits which convey flow through the roadway embankment) shall
be designed to pass the 25-year storm with HW/D less than or equal to 1.2. Effects of the
100-year storm shall also be analyzed to ensure that:
1) No flooding will occur on upstream off-site properties due to backwater
from the culvert.
2) The stability of the roadway embankment will not be compromised due to
overtopping.
3) Proposed or existing structures and utilities will not be inundated due to
backup of stormwater created by installation of a culvert or other drainage
structure.
4) No structures will be constructed on lots within the 100-year flood limits
created by backup of stormwater from culverts or other stormwater
structures.
Storm drainage pipes in the public or private right-of-way shall be reinforced
concrete with a minimum diameter of 15 inches. Pipes utilizing other materials with a
service life equal to or greater than reinforced concrete (as determined by an independent
testing agent) may be approved by the Town Engineer.
Headwalls plus an appropriate velocity dissipater will be required at the end of all
culvert systems (excluding driveway pipes) based on the following table;
END TREATMENT FOR CULVERTS
18” - 30” NO END TREATMENT.
>36” HEADWALL ON UPSTREAM END
Headwalls are also required if the skew of the pipe is less than 75 degrees or
greater than 105 degrees. Skew is defined as the angle from the centerline road line
ahead of the end of the pipe on the right-hand side of the road.
All reinforced concrete pipe shall be Class III or higher.
The maximum fill height for Class III RCP with standard bedding is 23 feet.
Loading conditions should be evaluated where deep fills or other high loads are expected
and the appropriate combination of pipe material, class of pipe, and bedding selected.
TOWN OF CARRBORO
Storm Drainage Design Manual Page #4
Minimum slopes for pipes and open ditches is 0.5%.
Maximum slopes for concrete pipes are 10.0%.
Minimum cover for reinforced concrete culverts is one foot to top of sub grade.
Pipes of materials other than reinforced concrete shall have minimum cover conforming
to manufacturer’s recommendation.
For cross drainage serving 10 acres or more, the maximum depth of the water
impounded during the 100-year flood shall not exceed fifteen (15) feet as measured from
the upstream invert of the culvert beneath the roadway section to the water surface
elevation unless appropriate engineering calculations are submitted verifying the stability
of the embankment against slope failure and seepage effects. Any detention facility
designed and construction in compliance with the North Carolina Dam Safety Regulations
shall be acceptable to the city.
Roads, which cross or parallel creeks serving more than 25 acres of drainage area
must have at least 2 feet of freeboard in the 10-year storm and 6 inches in the 100-year
storm. If this is impractical, the street may be designed to flood in the 100-year event
provided the flooding depth does not exceed 1 foot and substantial erosion protection is
provided on the downstream side of the roadway. In “regulated discharge floodplain
areas”, streets shall be constructed at or above the 100-year flood elevation.
No public roads are to be constructed on dams.
4. OPEN CHANNELS
For open channels, gradual changes in alignment, not to exceed a minimum radius
of 4 times the top width of channel is recommend. Where no other options are available,
sharper changes in alignment may be allowed under the following conditions.
20 - 45 DEGREES Bank stabilization must be provided according
to tractive force analysis.
GREATER THAN 45 DEGREES Same as for above but in addition, freeboard
equal to or greater than 1/2 of the Q10 depth of
flow must be provided utilizing berms or other
appropriate means to increase depth of the
channel.
Side slopes for vegetated open channels in residential areas should be no greater
than 3 to 1 for stability, safety, and ease of maintenance. Where the channel width must
be limited, side slope may be increased if suitable structural stabilization techniques are
employed according to following the table and safety measures are utilized. A tractive
TOWN OF CARRBORO
Storm Drainage Design Manual Page #5
force analysis of the channel is also required. Aesthetics and ease of maintenance should
also be considered in the design.
MAXIMUM SLOPES FOR COMMON STABILIZATION TECHNIQUES
STONE 1.5:1
GRID PAVERS 2:1
PAVING * 1:1
GABIONS VERTICAL
RETAINING WALLS VERTICAL
* Note: asphalt channel linings are not allowed.
5. EASEMENTS
Private drainage easements shall be provided outside of the public right-of-way:
? for all culverts; except private driveway pipes,
? for all new or existing open channels or watercourses,
? below all new or existing pipes and other points of concentrated flow;
? for primary and emergency dam spillways; or
? at other locations deemed appropriate by the Town engineer.
Normally, the easements shall be centered, but offset easements may be permitted by the
Town Engineer.
Easements widths may differ from the nominal width below if an engineering study is
performed, to the satisfaction of the Town Engineer, which demonstrates that the pipe or channel
can be excavated and maintained, meeting all OSHA sloping and other safety regulations, within
a different easement width.
Combined easements, with widths as approved by the Town Engineer, are permitted with
other utilities.
Private drainage easements containing only storm drainage facilities shall be of
sufficient width to provide for access and maintenance and shall be centered over the
culvert or watercourse with recommended widths based on the following table
TOWN OF CARRBORO
Storm Drainage Design Manual Page #6
FOR CULVERTS
0 TO 35 INCHES 20 FEET
36 TO 72 INCHES 40 FEET
72 INCHES AND ABOVE THE DIAMETER OR WIDTH PLUS 40 FEET
MULTIPLE CULVERTS THE SUM OF THE DIAMETERS PLUS 40 FEET
FOR OPEN CHANNELS
0 TO 25 ACRES 15 FEET ON EACH SIDE
25 TO 100 ACRES 25 FEET ON EACH SIDE
= 100 ACRES DETERMINE FLOOD BOUNDARIES
Widths shall be determined from the top of the bank or centerline if no banks are
discernible
All drainage easements shall be recorded based on field surveys, following
construction, to insure that the drainage structure or watercourse is centered within the
easement.
All drainage easements shall be designed to tie into existing easements, existing
watercourses, or to other appropriate locations when possible.
6. DETENTION
Detention of stormwater shall be provided in each development so that the peak
flow up to and including the post development 25-year storm leaving the site does not
exceed up to and including the pre-development 25-year storm peak. This requirement
may be varied by the Town Engineer based on existing conditions downstream and the
impact, which increased flow in the receiving watercourse, could have on flooding levels.
It is recommended that a pre-design meeting with the Town Engineer and the Town
Planning Director be held to discuss detention requirements.

persons loading and unloading supplies or merchandise may park temporarily in a fire lane
located in a shopping center or mall parking lot as long as the vehicle is not left unattended.
(b) Whenever the fire chief determines that a portion of a street, road, other access way,
or parking lot located adjacent to, near to or leading to a building used for residential purposes
should be designated as a fire lane according to the criteria set forth in subsection (c), he shall
specifically describe to the person in control of such area (the owner or occupant) the precise
dimensions and location of such area and require such person to mark such area in accordance with
the provisions of subsection (d).
(c) A fire lane should be established in any area described in subsection (b) that needs to
remain unobstructed so that fire fighting vehicles and other emergency vehicles have adequate
access to buildings. Subject to subsection (d), the precise dimensions and the location of each
12-4
fire lane shall be determined by the fire chief, exercising his best professional judgment in
furtherance of the objective state in the previous sentence. However, in most circumstances, the
minimum width of a fire lane shall be twenty feet.
(d) Subject to subsection (e), upon being provided with the information described in
subsection (b) of this section, the person entitled to control over the area where the fire lanes have
been established (the occupant or the owner) shall clearly mark the fire lanes as follows: (Amend
11/27/84)
(1) If the fire lane is designated adjacent to a curb, the lane shall be marked by
painting the curb yellow for the entire length of the fire lane and by posting
legible signs alongside of the fire lane within three feet of the curb that state
"No Parking, Fire Lane, Tow Away Zone". These signs shall be placed not
lower than four feet from the ground nor higher than seven feet. Sufficient
signs shall be placed so that no portion of the yellow pavement marking
designating the fire lane is more than fifty feet from such a sign. When so
designated, the fire lane shall comprise an area sixteen feet wide running
adjacent to the yellow curb marking.
(2) If the fire lane designated adjacent to the edge of a travel lane along which
there is a curb but along which signs may be placed without obstructing the
flow of traffic, then the lane shall be marked by posting legible signs
alongside the fire lane within three feet of the edge of the travel lane that
state "No Parking, Fire Lane, Tow Away Zone." These signs shall be placed
not lower than four feet from the ground nor higher than seven feet. Such
signs shall be placed at the extreme limits of the fire lane and at intervals of
not more than eighty feet. When so designated, the fire lane shall comprise
an area twenty feet wide running adjacent to the edge of the travel lane
where the fire lane signs are posted.
(3) If the fire lane is designated in an area not adjacent to a curb and not in an
area where signs can be conveniently posted, lanes shall be marked by
outlining the perimeter of the lane with a yellow line not less than three
inches wide, and painting on the pavement within the fire lane the words
"No Parking, Fire Lane, Tow Away Zone" in letters not less than six inches
high, so that no portion of the fire lane is more than thirty feet from the
painted words "Fire Lane". (Amend. 11/26/85)
(e) If the fire chief determines that the manner of marking fire lanes as prescribed in
subsection (d) is impracticable, unnecessarily cumbersome or difficult or causes an unnecessary
hardship because of the peculiar circumstances affecting a particular fire lane and that adequate
notice of the existence of the fire line can be given in some other way, he may authorize the person
exercising control over the area of the fire lane to mark the lane is some other satisfactory manner.
12-5
The fire chief shall inform such person in writing why the deviation is authorized and how the fire
lane must be marked. (Amend. 11/27/84)

of this chapter. If the Board determines that the applicant is not so qualified, it may refuse to
grant the requested franchise. If the Board determines that the applicant is so qualified, it may,
by ordinance, grant a franchise to such applicant, to be effective as provided in this section. No

section within the time limit set forth in subsection (b), the Board may, at any time thereafter
before acceptance, summarily revoke the franchise. Written notice of such revocation shall be
sent to the grantee forthwith.

(a) The town may grant one or more franchises for a service area. The town may, in
its sole discretion, limit the number of franchises granted, based upon, but not necessarily limited

16-9
1) The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate multiple cables
in addition to the cables, conduits and pipes of the utility systems, such as
electrical power, telephone, gas and sewage.
2) The impact on the community of having multiple franchises.
3) The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition, such as
the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents’ property, and the
disruption arising from numerous excavations of the rights-of-way.
4) The financial capabilities of the applicant and its guaranteed commitment
to make the necessary financial investment and to maintain and operate
the proposed system for the duration of the franchise term.
(b) Subject to the provisions of Sections 16-17 and 16-18, any additional franchise
granted by the town to provide cable service in a part of the town in which a franchise has
already been granted and where an existing grantee is providing service shall require the new
grantee to provide service throughout its service area within a reasonable time and in a sequence
which does not discriminate against lower income residents.
Section 16-11. Transfer or Assignment of Cable Television System.
a) No transfer of control of a franchise or assignment of a franchise to operate a cable
television system, other than a pro forma transfer or assignment to a parent or wholly owned
subsidiary corporation or other form of organization, shall take place, whether by force or
voluntary sale, lease, mortgage, assignment, encumbrance, foreclosure, attachment, merger, or
other form of disposition, without prior notice to and approval by the Board. The notice shall

such other provisions and requirements as the Board might require.
c) For the purpose of this section the term “control” is not limited to majority stock
ownership, but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable
presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or
accumulation by any person or group of persons of ten percent (10%) of the voting shares of the

transfer or assignment of the franchise before completion of initial construction of the energized

debts; or
5) Grantee violates any FCC order or ruling or the order or ruling of any
other governmental body having jurisdiction over the grantee, unless the
grantee is lawfully contesting the legality of applicability of such order.
6) The operation of the cable television system is discontinued for a
continuous period of thirty (30) days.

such grantee.
Section 16-15. Purchase of System by Successor Grantee or Town.

sell the entire cable television system to the new grantee at its fair market value as determined by
three (3) competent, independent appraisers, one each to be appointed by the terminated grantee,
the new grantee, and the Board. The appraisers so appointed shall use the then-best methods of
appraising to determine this value. The cost of the appraisers shall be shared equally by the
terminated grantee and the new grantee. The terminated grantee shall execute such deeds, bills
of sale and other documents as may be necessary to effectuate this sale. The terminated grantee
shall fully cooperate with these appraisers.

purchased by a successor under Section 16-15, or the town (in the case of a public right-of-way)
or the owner of a private right-of-way authorizes the grantee to abandon this property in place.
(b) In removing its plants, structures, and equipment, the grantee shall refill, at its own
expense, any excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave such public and private places in
as good condition as that prevailing prior to the company’s removal of its equipment and
appliances without affecting, altering, or disturbing in any way the electric distribution or
telephone cable, wire, or attachments or any poles. The town manager shall appoint a town
officer or employee to inspect and approve the condition of such public ways and public places
and cables, wire attachments, and poles after removal. Liability insurance and indemnity
provided for herein shall continue in full force and effect during the entire period of removal.

1) That lot is located within a residential subdivision (or phase or section
thereof) that is being developed according to a master plan for the entire
subdivision;

lines have been developed and sold and are occupied.

cables, conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances, attachments, and
other property as may be necessary and appurtenant to the cable television system; and to use,
operate and provide similar facilities or properties rented or leased from other persons.
However, before any poles, wires, or other thing mentioned above as necessary and appurtenant

authority to do so must be obtained by the grantee from the town (pursuant to Chapter 7 of the
Town Code) or the North Carolina Department of Transportation or other agency of competent
jurisdiction.
Section 16-22. Franchise and Other Fees.
(a) Following the issuance and acceptance of a franchise, the grantee shall pay to the
town for the privilege of constructing, operating, and maintaining the cable television system and
for the privilege of providing cable service and using public rights-of-way, a franchise fee in the
amount and according to the schedule set forth in the franchise. Unless otherwise specified in

under applicable law (which, on the effective date of this chapter, is 5% of the grantee’s gross
annual revenues).
(1) The town, on an annual basis, shall be furnished a statement within ninety
(90) days of the close of the grantee’s fiscal year, certified by an official of
the grantee responsible for the system’s financial statements, reflecting the

other computations relevant to the determination of the amount of
franchise fees owed by grantee for the previous fiscal year. Upon ten (10)
days prior written notice, the town shall have the right to conduct an
independent audit of franchisee’s records. If, after resolving any dispute

the right to inspect at any time during regular business hours the financial

five (5) years during the term of this franchise, and the franchise fee, at the sole option of the

appropriate in order to maintain the franchise fee at a level consistent with:
(1) Franchise fees being paid by cable telecommunications companies
operating under similar conditions; or
(2) The costs incurred by the town in administering this franchise; or
(3) The value of the company’s right to use town public ground, highways,
roads, streets, alleys, sidewalks, greenways, public ways, and utility
easements as may be available; or
(4) Any applicable statutes, laws, rules and regulations.
(c) If the franchise fee is adjusted upward as provided in subsection (c), such

Section 16-26. Additional Town Rights in Franchise.
(a) The town may from time to time add to, modify, or delete provisions of this
ordinance as it shall deem necessary in the exercise of its regulatory powers, so long as such

16-18
additions or revisions shall be made only after a public hearing for which the grantee shall have
received at least ten (10) days prior written notice.
(b) The town reserves the right upon reasonable notice to require the grantee at its
expense to protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove from the town’s streets

power or communication lines or other types of structures, or other improvements by
governmental agencies. Reasonable notice under this subsection shall be construed to mean at
least thirty (30) days except in the case of emergencies, when no specific notice period shall be
required.
(c) If the grantee fails to complete any work required by subsection (b) above or any
work required by town ordinance within the times established and to the satisfaction of the town,

fixtures necessary for municipal networks such as police and fire, on the condition that such
installations and maintenance thereof do not interfere with the operations of the grantee.
(g) Neither the granting of any franchise nor any governing provision of such
franchise shall constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any governmental right of power of
the town, including without limitation the power of eminent domain.
(h) Any right or power in or duty impressed upon any officer, employee, department
or board of the town shall be subject to transfer by the Board by law to any other officer,
employee, department or board of the town. The town reserves all rights not specifically granted

right or power the town may otherwise have.

constructed and installed so as to cause minimum interference with the proper use of said street
or roads, and minimum interference with the property rights of property owners adjoining said

perform any act required. The time for performance may be extended or excused, as the case

GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 17-1. How the Chapter Shall Be Known and Cited
The rules and regulations prescribed by this Chapter, shall be known and may be
cited as “The Housing Code of the Town of Carrboro” and will be referred to hereinafter
as “this Chapter.”
Section 17-2. Legislative Findings and Authority
The Board of Aldermen hereby finds and declares that there exists in the Town of
Carrboro housing which is unfit for human habitation due to dilapidation, defects
increasing the hazards of fire, accidents or other calamities, lack of ventilation, light or
sanitary facilities, and other conditions rendering such housing unsafe or unsanitary, or
dangerous or detrimental to the health or safety, or otherwise inimical to the welfare of
the residents of the Town of Carrboro. Accordingly, the Board finds that a public
necessity exists to exercise the police powers of the Town pursuant to Part 6, Article 19
of Chapter 160A of the General Statutes of North Carolina, as now or hereafter amended,
to cause the repair and rehabilitation, closing or demolishing of such housing in the
manner herein provided.
Section 17-3 Scope and Application of the Chapter
(a) The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to any dwelling, irrespective of
when such building was constructed, altered or repaired. Portable, mobile or modular
buildings or structures, including trailers, when used or intended for use as a dwelling
within the town shall be subject to the applicable provisions of this Chapter.
(b) The provisions of this Chapter shall be applicable within the corporate
limits of the Town and its extraterritorial planning jurisdiction (but not including the Joint
Planning Area).
Section 17-4 Administration
(a) Administration and enforcement of this Chapter shall be the responsibility
of the inspector. (See Section 17-5(15), 17-25 and 17-26 of this Chapter.)

deemed to be notice to the owner.

designed to be occupied by longer term residents (at least month-to-month) as opposed to
overnight or weekly guests.
(3) BUILDING CODE. The North Carolina State Building Code which
has been established pursuant to G.S. § 143, Article 9. Unless otherwise stated, all

and includes any outhouses and appurtenances belonging thereto or usually enjoyed
therewith, except that it does not include any manufactured home or mobile home, which
is used solely for a seasonal vacation purpose. The term “housing” is used synonymously

decision and order that in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to that end it
shall have all the powers of the public officer, but the concurring vote of four members of
the board shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the public
officer. The board shall have power also in passing upon appeals, when practical
difficulties or unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of the
ordinance, to adapt the application of the ordinance to the necessities of the case to the
end that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured,

pending a final disposition of the cause.
The petition shall be filed within thirty (30) days after the issuance of the order or
the rendering of the decision. Hearings shall be had by the court on a petition within
twenty (20) days, and shall be given preference over other matters on the court’s
calendar. The court shall hear and determine the issue raised and shall enter such final
order or decree as law and justice may require.
It shall not be necessary to file bond in any amount before obtaining a temporary
injunction under this paragraph.
Section 17-31. Failure to Comply With an Order
(a) Upon order of the inspector duly made and served as provided in this
Chapter and within the time specified in the inspector’s order, it shall be unlawful for the

human habitation. The ordinance shall describe the property or properties affected by
this Section. No such ordinance shall be adopted to require demolition of a dwelling until
the owner has first been given a reasonable opportunity to bring it into conformity with
the provisions of this Chapter. Such ordinance shall be recorded in the office of the
17-32
Orange County Register of Deeds and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner
in the grantor index.
Section 17-32. Abandonment of Property
(a) If the inspector has issued an order for a dwelling to be repaired, altered,
improved or vacated and closed, as provided in Section 17-31 of this Chapter, and if the
owner has vacated and closed such dwelling and kept it vacated and closed for a period of
one year pursuant to the ordinance or order, then if the Board of Aldermen shall find that
(1) The owner has abandoned the intent and purpose to repair, alter or
improve the dwelling in order to render it fit for human habitation;
(2) That the continuation of the dwelling in its vacated and closed state
would be inimical to the health, safety, and welfare of the
municipality in that the dwelling would continue to deteriorate;
(3) That the dwelling would create a fire and safety hazard;
(4) That the dwelling would be a threat to children and vagrants;
(5) That the dwelling would attract persons intent on criminal activities;

human habitation can be made at a cost of fifty percent (50%) or
less of the then current value of the dwelling, the ordinance shall
require that the owner either repair or demolish and remove the
dwelling with 90 days; or
(ii) If it is determined that the repair of the dwelling to render it fit for
human habitation can only be made at a cost exceeding fifty
percent (50%) of the then current value of the dwelling, the
ordinance shall require the owner to demolish and remove the
dwelling within 90 days.
17-33
(b) The ordinance in subsection (a) of this section shall be recorded in the

its tenor, and if on its return it appears to have been duly served, and if at the hearing the
inspector produces a certified copy of an ordinance adopted by the Board of Aldermen
pursuant to subsection 17-31(c) of this Chapter authorizing the inspector to proceed to
vacate the occupied dwelling, the magistrate shall enter judgment ordering the premises
