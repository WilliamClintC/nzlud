parcels of land and the rights and easements therein necessary to be
taken, and the commencement, course and termination of the street, alley,
lane, highway, public ground or sewers proposed to be laid out, widened,
extended or altered or other work or improvement, proposed to be made in
and through the land and easements so to be taken, and for that purpose
the Department of Public Works and those acting by its direction may enter
upon any lands in said city. The Department of Public Works shall deliver
such map and a statement of its intention and object to the Common Council
by filing the same with the City Clerk. The Common Council shall then give
notice to the owner or owners of said lands or easements, by resolution
describing in general terms the improvements to be made, the lands or
easements proposed to be taken according to the map herein required and
notifying the owner or owners that, on or before a day specified, which
shall not be less than 20 days from the date of the resolution, claims for
the taking and appropriation of said lands or easements shall be filed with
the City Clerk. Such resolution shall be published twice a week for two
successive weeks in the official newspapers of the city. If no claims are
filed as required by said resolution such owner or owners shall be deemed
to have waived all claims for damages and consented and agreed to such
improvement and the city may thereupon enter upon and take possession
of such lands. In case claims for damages shall be filed as aforesaid,
the Department of Public Works shall proceed to acquire such lands or
easements pursuant to the provisions of the Condemnation Law.
§ C14-3. Assessment of expense and possession.
When the Department of Public Works shall have ascertained the damages
the owner or owners so filing claims as aforesaid will sustain by reason
of the taking of such lands or easements, after making due allowance for
any benefit to be derived therefrom, and their report thereon to the Court
shall have been confirmed, they shall proceed to determine the district
immediately benefited by said improvement and apportion the damages
determined by them and the costs and expenses of such proceedings as
fixed by the Court in the order confirming their report against the property
in said district benefited thereby as nearly as may be in proportion to the
benefits to be derived therefrom. If, in their judgment, the whole of such
damage, cost and expenses cannot be justly and equitably assessed against
the property in said district, then said Department shall only assess such
portion thereof as in their judgment will be just and equitable, and the
balance, not to exceed 25% of the expense, shall be paid by a general
tax upon the city and shall be raised, levied and collected in the next
annual tax levy and paid to the persons entitled thereto. The certificate of
assessment, made by said Department, shall briefly describe the real estate
assessed, the names of the owners or occupants so far as ascertainable,
and if unoccupied, or the names of the owners are unknown, the street or
lot number thereof, and when completed shall, together with a duplicate
thereof, be signed by said Department and filed with the City Clerk within
60 days after their appointment. The City Engineer shall furnish the maps
necessary for such assessment, and they shall be made part thereof. The
Department of Public Works shall then give notice, to be published for eight
§ C14-2 CHARTER § C14-3
C:51
days in the official newspapers of the city, that said assessment has been so
returned and filed, and may be examined by all persons interested therein,
and that a motion will be made, at a special term of the Supreme Court, to
be held in the Third Judicial District, on a day specified, to confirm the same
and that all persons objecting to said assessment and desiring to be heard in
opposition to its confirmation shall file their objections, in writing, with the
City Clerk at least three days before the time designated for such motion,
and persons omitting to file such objections with the Clerk shall be deemed
to have waived the right to oppose confirmation, and to have consented
thereto. The Court, on the day specified in such notice, or such other day as
it may determine, shall hear the persons entitled to appear and may confirm
or annul such assessment. If confirmed, the assessment shall be conclusive
; if annulled, it may be referred back to the Department of Public Works
without further notice. In the making and return of the second assessment
the Department of Public Works shall proceed as in the first instance; when
the report of the Department of Public Works as to the damages to be paid
to the owners shall be confirmed by the Court, the Department of Public
Works may enter upon and take possession of said lands or easements
and proceed with the improvements, and the damages shall be paid to the
persons entitled thereto when collected by the Comptroller.
§ C14-4. Grading, paving and macadamizing streets; constructing
sewers and assessments therefor.
The Department of Public Works may cause any street, alley, lane, highway
or public ground or any part thereof not previously graded, paved,
macadamized or asphalted at the expense, in whole or in part, of the
property fronting thereon, to be graded, paved, macadamized or asphalted,
and determine what part, if any, not exceeding 25% of the expense thereof
shall be paid by the Department of Public Works and what part of such
expenses, less that portion which any railroad company or other corporation
holding a public franchise for the use of a part of such lane or highway
or other public ground is legally liable to pay, shall be paid by special
assessment on the property fronting on such improvement. The Department
of Public Works may also make and construct new crosswalks, drains,
culverts and sewers, and in like manner determine the proportions to
be paid by the Department of Public Works and by special assessment
against the property immediately benefited thereby. The Department of
Public Works shall deliver to the Common Council a statement of its
determination as to such special assessment, and of the object therefor,
by filing the same with the City Clerk. The Common Council shall direct
the assessor to forthwith proceed to determine the district within which
the property benefited by said improvement is located; and cause the City
Engineer to make the necessary map therefor; and to cause the Assessor to
make a certificate of such special assessment, entering thereon the names
of the owners where ascertainable, and where the parcels are unoccupied
or owned by nonresidents or the names of the owners cannot be
ascertained, the lot, street or map number shall be deemed sufficient. He
shall make a just and equitable assessment of the costs and expenses of
such improvement as audited by the Department of Public Works against
§ C14-3 KINGSTON CITY CODE § C14-4
C:52
the owners or occupants of the land deemed to be benefited, assessing
each parcel in proportion to the benefit which in his judgment has been
derived from said improvement and shall enter in such certificate a brief
description of the parcel assessed and the sum assessed against it. When
said certificate is completed he shall publish a notice that the same has
been completed, filed in the office of the Assessor, and may be examined by
all persons interested therein, and specifying a day not less than 10 days
from the date of said notice, within which all persons interested in said
assessment may present objections thereto. Such notice shall be published
at least twice in the official newspapers of said city. At the time and place
specified in said notice the Assessor shall receive all objections presented,
in writing, in relation to said assessment, and shall hear and examine the
same and after such hearing and examination make such correction therein
as may be just and proper. When such certificate shall be thus corrected,
the Assessor shall sign the same, together with the duplicate thereof, and
deliver them to the Common Council and the Department of Public Works
by filing with the City Clerk. Such delivery shall be made within 20 days
from the time specified in the Assessor's notice of hearing unless such time
shall be extended by the Common Council. Such certificate shall be laid
before the Common Council at its first regular meeting after such filing,
and any person interested therein may present objections, in writing, to
the confirmation thereof. If no such objections-in-writing are presented, the
Common Council shall confirm the same and such confirmation shall be
final and conclusive on all parties and persons interested. If such objections
are presented the Common Council may hear and examine the same at
the meeting when such assessment was laid before it or the next regular
meeting thereafter, and after such examination and hearing may annul or
confirm the same. If they confirm the same, such confirmation shall be final
and conclusive; and if they annul, the matter shall be referred back to the
Assessor, and he shall make a new assessment proceeding as in the first
instance. If the Assessor shall be interested in property to be affected by
such assessment, or be from any cause incapable of acting, the Mayor may
appoint a disinterested freeholder in the manner hereinbefore provided.
When any assessment, pursuant to this article, shall be finally confirmed
by the Court or Common Council, the certificate thereof, together with
a duplicate, shall be filed with the City Clerk and both shall be deemed
originals, to either of which shall be annexed the warrant for the collection
of said assessment, under the Seal of the city and signed by the Mayor
and City Clerk, commanding the Comptroller to collect the amount thereof
in the manner hereinbefore provided. The Common Council shall make a
report of its proceedings to said Department.
§ C14-5. Change of grade; compensation.
When the grade of any street or highway has been established, it shall not
be changed except upon the petition of the owners of a majority of the
lineal feet fronting on the street, or part thereof, on which the grade is to
be changed, nor unless compensation be made to the owners claimed to be
injured by such change of grade. Notice of change of grade shall be given,

claims presented, damages ascertained and assessments made on account
thereof in the manner provided by §§ C14-2 and C14-4 of this act.

§ C14-7. Payment of work done; certificate of indebtedness; infant
owners; judgments by contractors.
All improvements to be paid for by special assessment unless otherwise
ordered by the Department of Public Works shall be by contract let to
the lowest responsible bidder and shall be paid for only from the funds
raised and collected for such improvements subject to the provisions of
this section. The Department of Public Works may, however, direct that
such improvements be made by and under its supervision, and the costs
A. It shall be the duty of any person or persons owning real property
abutting any City street upon which there are City sidewalks to
maintain said sidewalks in a reasonably safe condition.
B. The owner of such real property shall maintain, repair and/or replace
any sidewalks which have become deteriorated, uneven or broken up.
The Department of Public Works shall have the discretion to determine
if such sidewalks need to be repaired or replaced and, if so, shall
determine the materials to be used to remedy the condition.
C. If the provisions of Subsections A and B are not complied with, the
Department of Public Works, or designee, may serve written notice to
comply with the provisions of said subsections upon the owner of such
property. The Alderman in whose ward such sidewalks are located shall
also receive a copy of the written notice to comply.
D. Such notice shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested,
to such owner, at his/her last known address. Such notice shall require
compliance with the provisions of said Subsections A and B within thirty
(30) days after the time of posting of such notice as aforesaid.
E. If the person upon whom such notice is served fails, neglects or refuses
to repair or replace said sidewalks within 30 days after the date of
mailing of such notice as aforesaid, the Department of Public Works
shall cause such sidewalks to be repaired/replaced.
F. The actual cost to the City of repairing and/or replacing such sidewalks,
plus a sum equal to 5% of such actual cost for inspection and other
additional costs in connection therewith, shall be certified by the
Superintendent of Public Works and/or his designee to the City
Comptroller, and the amount thereof shall become and be a lien upon
the property on which such sidewalks abut. The total amount thereof
shall be added to and become a part of the next annual assessment roll
at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Charter of the City and
subject to all the provisions thereof.
§ C14-5 KINGSTON CITY CODE § C14-7
C:54
and expenses therefor shall be collected in the same manner as if said
improvements had been made by contract as herein provided. After the
damages, costs and expenses in condemnation proceedings taken pursuant
to §§ C14-2 and C14-3 of this act have been fixed by the order of
confirmation in such proceedings, and monthly during the continuance of
work under contract for any local improvement, made pursuant to § C14-5
of this act, the contractor for which shall have furnished a satisfactory
bond, approved by the Department of Public Works for its completion,
moneys shall be made available for the payment of the amount of damages
costs and expenses in such condemnation proceedings as fixed by such
order of confirmation or 75% of the amount of the monthly estimates of
work performed by such contractor during the preceding month, to be
determined as hereinafter prescribed; and on the completion of such work
for the balance due on the contract. If obligations are issued to finance
such improvements, the principal and interest of such obligations shall be
paid out of the amount collected on the special assessment on account of
which they were made. On receipt of sufficient funds from the proceeds
of the sale of the bonds or notes provided for by this section the City
Comptroller shall immediately pay the damages, costs and expenses of
any condemnation proceedings to pay which said bonds or notes were
issued. The City Engineer shall furnish to the Department of Public Works
monthly during the continuance of work performed under a contract for
any improvement made pursuant to § C14-4 of this act, which is to be
paid for in whole or in part by special assessment, a detailed estimate of
the actual value, according to the contract price, of the work done during
the preceding calendar month. The Department of Public Works may in
its discretion issue to the contractor for such improvement a warrant for
a sum not exceeding 75% of the amount of such monthly estimates and
the warrants so issued shall be paid from the proceeds of the bonds or
notes to be issued for such improvements as authorized by this section.
When the work to be done under contract is completed according to the
plans and specifications of the improvement, the City Engineer shall so
certify to the Department of Public Works, which, if it accepts the work,
may, in its discretion, issue to such contractor a warrant for the balance
due him, which warrant shall be paid in the same manner as such monthly
warrants. When any assessment pursuant to § C14-3 or § C14-4 of this
article, confirmed by the Court or Common Council is filed the Department
of Public Works shall as soon as practicable give notice thereof to the
owners of the lands affected thereby appearing by the certificate of such
assessment to be such owners, by mail to the post office address of such
owners so far as the same are known to said Department or can with
reasonable diligence be ascertained. Such notices shall contain a statement
that such owners can pay the assessments in cash or by installments. If,
within 10 days after the mailing of such notice any owner affected thereby
elects to pay in cash, by filing with the Department of Public Works written
notices of such election, his assessment shall be collected as prescribed in
Article XVI of this act. All other special assessments made pursuant to said
sections and the part of the damages, costs and expenses in condemnation
proceedings and of the expense of local improvements made under § C14-4
§ C14-7 CHARTER § C14-7
C:55
to be paid by the Department of Public Works shall become due and payable
in equal annual installments. Where the total amount to be paid under the
order of confirmation or contract for local improvement is less than $10,000
the number of such installments shall not exceed five; in any other case not
to exceed 10. The first of such equal annual installments of the part of such
damages, costs and expenses or of the expense of such local improvement
to be paid by general tax on the city at large shall be included in the next
annual tax levy, and one of the remaining equal annual installments thereof
shall be included in each succeeding annual tax levy, with interest at the
rate borne by the bonds or notes that may be issued to provide money
to pay for such improvement as hereinbefore provided, on the amount of
the part of such damages, costs and expenses or of the expense of such
local improvement to be paid by the Department of Public Works and
remaining unpaid, such interest to be calculated up to the time when the
next installment of interest on such bonds or notes become payable. The
first of such equal annual installments to be paid by the owners of lots or
parcels of land, against which such special assessment shall be assessed
by the Department of Public Works, in such condemnation proceedings
pursuant to § C14-3 of this act, or by the Assessor of said city, pursuant
to § C14-4 of this act, shall be payable after the delivery of the warrant
for the collection thereof to the Comptroller. In the manner prescribed for
the payment of taxes, by Article XVI of this act, and one of such equal
annual installments shall be due and payable annually thereafter in the
same manner, and without any further or additional notice, until the whole
amount of such special assessment is paid. There shall be due and payable
with each installment of said assessment, as a part of the assessment,
interest at the rate borne by the bonds or notes issued to provide money to
pay for such improvement as hereinbefore provided upon the entire amount
of such assessment remaining unpaid. The owner of any lot or parcel of land
so assessed may at any time pay to the City Comptroller the entire amount
of the assessment on his land with the interest accrued there on up to the
time of such payment, and thereupon such a lot or parcel of land shall be
discharged of and from the lien of such assessment. In case any installment
of such assessment, together with the interest due thereon, shall not be
paid when it shall become due and payable as herein provided the same
proceedings shall be had for the collection of such unpaid assessments,
including the sale of the lands against which said assessments may have
been assessed, as are authorized and provided by Article XVI of this act,
for the collection of taxes, levied by said Common Council in said annual
levy. In case of the sale by the owner of the lands assessed, they shall
be sold subject to the lien of all portion of such assessments as shall be
payable subsequently, and all other city assessments then a lien thereon.
The Department of Public Works may provide for the payment for any other
unfinished local improvement to be paid for by special assessment, in the
manner herein provided. The Department of Public Works may by ordinance
declare any improvement mentioned in this section excepted from the
operation of this section to such extent as may be stated in the ordinance,
but such exception shall not unless otherwise ordered by the Department of
Public Works allow the same, if to be paid for by special assessment, to be
§ C14-7 KINGSTON CITY CODE § C14-7
C:56
done otherwise than by contract let to the lowest responsible bidder. The
Department of Public Works may, however, direct that such improvements
be made by and under the supervision of said Department, and the costs
and expenses therefor shall be collected in the same manner as if said
improvements had been made by contract as herein provided. Where there
are infants or other incompetent persons whose property is affected by any
assessment made pursuant to this act, the County or Supreme Court, or
a Judge or Justice thereof, may, on application in behalf of such infant or
incompetent person, appoint a guardian ad litem to protect his interests.
In any case where a judgment has been or shall be obtained in favor of
a contractor for an improvement to be paid for in whole or in part by
special assessments, against the owners of lots or parcels of land, the
Department of Public Works may by resolution direct that such special
assessments be collected in installments, notwithstanding any declaration
in the resolution authorizing the improvement excepting such improvement
from the operation of § C14-7 in such case, the Department of Public Works
may fix the number of equal annual installments in which such assessments
shall be collected; and in all other respects the method of such collection,
including interest on installments unpaid at the rate of 6% per annum, shall
be as provided in § C14-7.

The connecting or supply pipes leading from the dwellings or other places to
the distribution pipes, and the pipes leading to the sewers shall be inserted
and kept in repair at the expense of the owner or occupant of the property
or buildings with which they are connected, and shall not be inserted or
connected with the main pipe and sewer until a permit therefor shall be
obtained from said Department, and all such connecting or supply pipes and
fixtures shall be constructed under and according to the direction of the

Best Value Competitive Bidding and Procurement
[Adopted 6-7-2016 by L.L. No. 2-2016, approved 6-21-2016]
§ 103-3. Title.
This article shall be known as the "City of Kingston Local Law Authorizing
Best Value Competitive Bidding and Procurement."
§ 103-4. Purpose and intent.
The intent of this article is to allow the City of Kingston Purchasing
Department the option to award certain purchase contracts (including
contracts for services) subject to the competitive bidding under § 103 of the
General Municipal Law on the basis of a low bid or "best value," as defined
in § 163 of the New York State Finance Law.
§ 103-5. Best value competitive bidding.
A. Authority and purpose. Section 103 of New York State General
Municipal Law allows the City to authorize, by local law, the award of
certain purchase contracts (including contracts for services) subject to
competitive bidding on the basis of "best value," as defined in § 163 of
the New York State Finance Law. The "best value" option may be used,
for example, if it is more cost efficient over time to award the good or
service to other than the lowest responsible bidder or offeror if factors
such as lower cost of maintenance, durability, high quality and longer
product life can be documented. Awarding contracts on the basis of
best value is further intended to promote competition, foster fairness
among vendors and competitors, expedite contract awards and enhance
efficiency among responsive and responsible vendors and competitors.
B. Award based on best value. The Purchasing Department may award
purchase contracts, including contracts for services, based on the basis
of "best value," as the term is defined in New York State Finance Law
§ 163.
C. Applicability. The provisions of this article apply to City purchase
contracts, including contracts for services, involving an expenditure of
more than $20,000, but excluding purchase contracts necessary for the
completion of a public works contract pursuant to Article 8 of the New
York Labor Law and any other contract that may in the future be
excluded under state law from the best value option. If the dollar
thresholds of New York State General Municipal Law § 103 are
increased or decreased in the future by the State Legislature, the dollar
thresholds set forth herein shall be deemed simultaneously amended to
match the new General Municipal Law thresholds.
D. Standard for best value.
§ 103-3 PLANNING BOARD § 103-5
96:137
(1) Goods and services procured and awarded on the basis of best
value are those that the Purchasing Department determines
optimize quality, cost and efficiency, among responsive and
responsible bidder or offerors.
(2) Where possible, the determination shall be based on an objective
and quantifiable analysis of clearly described and documented
criteria as they apply to the rating of bids or offers.
(3) The criteria may include, but shall not be limited to, any or all of the
following: costs of maintenance, proximity to the contractors;
longer product life; product performance criteria; and quality of
craftsmanship.
E. Documentation. Whenever any contract is awarded on the basis of best
value instead of the lowest responsible bidder, the basis for determining
best value shall be thoroughly and accurately documented.

§ 179-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ABANDONED BUILDING OR PROPERTY  A building which is vacant and
not properly maintained as set forth in § 179-5A.
BUILDING OFFICIAL/CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER/INSPECTOR  A
duly authorized representative of the City of Kingston, Ulster County, New
York, holding the position of Building Official, Deputy Building Official,

A. The Common Council of the City of Kingston, Ulster County, New York,
recognizes that there is a rising number of properties within the City
that have become vacant or abandoned as the result of the mortgage
foreclosure process under New York State law or for other reasons. The
Common Council recognizes that certain buildings, both residential and
commercial, have remained abandoned, vacant or boarded up for long
periods of time, some for many years. As such, these buildings and the
properties upon which they are constructed can become unsightly and
unsafe and have a negative effect on their surroundings and upon the
community in general. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a
program for identifying and registering abandoned and vacant
buildings and properties; to determine the responsibility of the owners
or mortgagees of these properties; to set forth the process for securing,
maintaining and rehabilitating these properties; and to require the
registration of these properties with the Building Official/Code
Enforcement Officer of the City of Kingston.
B. The Common Council of the City of Kingston intends that the provisions
of this chapter are to prevent properties that have been abandoned and/
or vacant from becoming dangerous, blighted, overgrown, susceptible
to vandalism and otherwise nuisances to the public in general and
specifically to surrounding property owners. The Common Council
recognizes that properties involved in the mortgage foreclosure
process in particular are left vacant and/or abandoned and could breed
nuisance and criminal activity for months and years after. Accordingly,
the Common Council believes that the provisons of this chapter are in
the best interests of the public health and safety.

3-2007, approved 6-22-2007]
The Common Council finds that public nuisances exist in the City of
Kingston in the operation of certain establishments and the use of property
in flagrant violation of the penal laws relating to controlled substances,
dangerous drugs and drug paraphernalia/smoking devices, all of which
substantially and seriously interfere with the interest of the public in the
quality of life and total community environment, commerce in the city,
property values and the public health, safety and welfare. The Common
Council further finds that the continued occurrence of such activities and
violations is detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the City of
Kingston and of the business thereof and the visitors thereto. It is the
purpose of this chapter to authorize and empower the Chief of Police to
impose sanctions and penalties for such public nuisances, and such powers
may be exercised either in conjunction with, or apart from, the powers
contained in other laws without prejudice to the use of procedures and
remedies available under such other laws. The Council further finds that
the sanctions and penalties imposed by the Chief pursuant to this chapter
constitute an additional and appropriate method of law enforcement in
response to the proliferation of the above-described public nuisances. The
sanctions and penalties are reasonable and necessary in order to protect
the health and safety of the people of the city and to promote the general
welfare.

GRAFFITI
§ 250-1. Intent, findings, purposes and considerations. [Amended
5-1-2007 by L.L. No. 2-2007, approved 5-21-2007]
It is the intention of the City of Kingston Common Council to promote
the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City of Kingston by
adopting a local law designed to deter the defacing of public and private
property with aerosol spray paint cans, broad-tip markers, pens, and writing
and artistic devices. The Common Council finds further that such
§ 233-11 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 250-1
236:336
defacement of property is most often committed by persons under 18 years
of age using aerosol spray cans and broad-tipped indelible markers; that
such persons rarely have a legitimate need for such aerosol cans or
markers; that where such a need exists, such aerosol cans and markers
may be furnished by a parent or guardian and, therefore, that, within the
City, the sale of such aerosol cans and markers to such persons would
be restricted. Further, it is the recommendation of the Common Council
that, where appropriate, the City Court require those who commit acts of
defacement to restore the property so damaged, or to perform suitable
alternate community service pursuant to the Court's direction.
§ 250-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings

appearance of.
GRAFFITI  The etching, painting, covering, drawing upon or otherwise
placing of a mark upon public or private property with intent to damage
such property.
PEN  Any instrument or similar implement that contains an ink fluid or
similar coloring matter.
WRITING AND ARTISTIC DEVICE  Any crayon, pastels stick, charcoal and
artistic paints.
§ 250-3. Restrictions.

kind, including those in the course of construction, owned by any
person, firm or corporation or any public agency or instrumentality,
without the express permission of the owner or operator of said

B. No person shall possess any graffiti instruments such as any tool,
instrument, article, substance, solution or other compound designed or

62, Art. I, of the 1984 Code]
§ 264-1. Legislative intent.
§ 264-2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
COMMISSION  The Landmark Preservation Commission of the City of
Kingston, New York, hereinafter referred to as the "Commission."
DISTRICT  Historical and Architectural Design District.
EXTERIOR FEATURE  The design and general arrangement of the
exterior of a structure open to view from a public way, public property or
any part of a public building including kind, color and texture of building
materials, number, proportion, type and spacing of windows, doors, walls,
A. The purpose of this article is to provide for the promotion of the
educational, cultural, economic and general welfare of the public
through the protection, enhancement, perpetuation and preservation of
an Historic and Architectural Design District to be known as the
"Stockade Area." The legislative body declares that it is in the public
interest to ensure that the distinctive and historical character of this
Historic and Architectural Design District shall not be injuriously
affected, that the value to the community of those buildings having
architectural and historical worth shall not be impaired and that said
Historic and Architectural Design District be maintained and preserved
to promote its use of the education, pleasure and welfare of the citizens
of the City of Kingston, New York, and others.
B. The Stockade Area of Kingston, New York, consisting of eight blocks
bounded by Clinton Avenue, Main Street, Green Street and North Front
Street, together with protective perimeter, is the site of the stockade
built by Peter Stuyvesant in 1658 and successive extensions under
English rule. In this area there were two Indian massacres, one in 1659
and one in 1664, as well as the location of the founding of the first
government of the State of New York in 1777 and burned by the British
that same year. This area contains the architecture of the past 300
years, and new development must not be allowed to erode the best of
the architectural spaces and cultural association of the past.
C. The Common Council of the City of Kingston, New York, recognizes the
unique and valuable resources which the Stockade Area represents.
This article ensures that the Stockade and its environment is given
adequate and immediate protection. The Stockade Area is hereby
declared an historic site to represent an important heritage related to
Dutch and English colonial periods.

building.
HISTORIC AND ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN DISTRICT  The area of the
City of Kingston, New York, commonly referred to as the "Stockade Area,"
as specifically delineated on the Zoning Map in the Building Inspector's
office in the City of Kingston, New York, and which:
HOLDER OF A BENEFICIAL INTEREST  A lessee of record in possession
for a term in excess of one year and any first or second mortgagee of record.
§ 264-3. Powers and duties of Commission.
§ 264-4. Criteria for review of proposed construction and alteration
of architectural features.
The Stockade Area is characterized by a diversity of styles, designs and
relationships of buildings and spaces, with many buildings from the 17th,
18th and 19th centuries. Though differing in style, there are only two or
three surface materials used, with stone, wood or brick being the most
common. Except for retail display windows, large plain surfaces, large glass
areas and polished metals are absent.
Has a special character or special historical or aesthetic interest or
value; represents one or more areas in the history of the city; and
causes such area, by reason of such factors, to constitute a Stockade
Area and perimeter.
A.
Is designated as an Historic and Architectural Design District by proper
amendment of Ch. 405, Zoning, so designating the area.
B.
A. It shall be the duty of the Commission to exercise judgment in accord
with the basis of decisions stated herein and maintain the desirable
character of the Stockade Area and prevent construction,
reconstruction, alteration or demolition out of harmony with existing
buildings insofar as character, material, color, line and detail are
concerned; and thus to prevent degeneration of property, to safeguard
public health, promote safety and preserve the beauty of character of
the Stockade Area.
B. In addition to the aforementioned powers, the Commission shall have
the power to retain or employ professional consultants, secretaries,
clerks or other such personnel as may be necessary to assist the
Commission in carrying out its duties, with such funds as may be made
available to it by the Common Council, in its sole judgment and
discretion.
A. In its consideration or review, the Commission may require such
characteristics to be reflected in proposed designs.
§ 264-2 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 264-4
261:344
§ 264-5. Design criteria.
B. All applications shall be considered by the Commission on at least the
following points, these points to be used as a basis where relevant for
establishing relationships to the external features of buildings in the
immediate neighborhood:
(1) The building height in relation to surrounding buildings.
(2) The relationship to nearby roof shapes.
(3) The relationship between the width and the height of the front
elevation.
(4) The size, proportion and spacing of openings within the facade and
elevations exposed to view.
(5) Rhythm of spacing of buildings and building elements on the street.
(6) The design and placement of entrances and projections.
(7) The relationship of materials, textures and colors.
(8) The relationship of architectural details.
(9) The continuity of walls.
(10) The relationship of landscape elements.
(11) The appropriateness of paving.
(12) The effect on existing or historically significant spaces.
C. It shall be the duty of the Commission to determine whether or not the
proposed construction, reconstruction or alteration of the exterior
architectural feature or features involved shall be appropriate to the
preservation of the Stockade Area.
A. Application. This article shall apply to all buildings, structures,
outbuildings, walls, fences, steps, topographical fixtures, earthworks,
landscaping, paving and signs. No changes in any exterior architectural
feature, including, but not limited to, construction, reconstruction,
alteration, restoration, removal, demolition or painting, shall be made
except as hereinafter provided.
B. To assist in the conservation action, several specific guidelines are
included. Because of the visual importance of the Old Dutch Church
Steeple, no new structure may rise within the Stockade Area above the
base of the steeple, which is 62 feet above curb level. Many of the most
important buildings in the Stockade Area are stone, wood or brick with
only two or three surface materials used on any one building. These are
almost no large areas of glass or polished metal. For this reason, limited
design criteria to match this condition are placed on all restoration and
construction. New construction may be required to be set back from the

261:345
§ 264-6. Certificate of recommendation.
building line formed by the adjacent buildings where this modest
setback will not change the overall character of the street. Landscaping
may be required.
C. Site design. In determining building setback for new construction, the
Commission may require new buildings to be set behind existing
building lines to give emphasis to existing structures of historic or
aesthetic merit, or to allow for suitable landscaping.
D. Landscaping and paving. Landscaping may be required by the
Commission and is deemed an important element of site development.
(1) Evergreen materials may be required for screening functions.
(2) Recommendations may be made to the Commission by a landscape
architect or designer approved by the Commission.
(3) Bluestone, slate or brick may be prescribed for sidewalks.
(4) Maintenance of plant material shall be the responsibility of the
owner, including the responsibility to keep growth trimmed and
trained to meet the Commission's requirement.
E. Parking. Parking areas shall be partially screened from public view with
appropriate walls, structures, fences or landscaping. The area allotted
for the planting of all parking lots shall be at least 5% of the amount
allotted to the parking surface.
F. Preventive maintenance. In order to assure that these buildings,
spaces, elements and details are preserved, the Stockade Area Plan
may require maintenance to prevent loss by neglect or deterioration.
Failure to provide this preventive maintenance shall be a violation of
this article.
A. Notwithstanding any inconsistent ordinance, local law, code, rule or
regulation concerning the issuance of building permits, no change in
any exterior architectural feature in the Stockade Area shall be
commenced without a certificate of recommendation from the
Commission, nor shall any building permits for such change be issued
without a certificate of recommendation having first been issued. The
certificate of recommendation required by this section shall be in
addition to and not in lieu of any building permit that may be required
by any other ordinance of the City of Kingston, New York.
B. Application for a certificate of recommendation shall be made in
writing, in duplicate, to the Commission and shall contain the following:

building or property.
(8) A photograph of existing conditions may be required.
C. Prior to submitting a formal application, the applicant or his
representative may meet with the Commission to informally discuss
plans for alteration of exterior features. In order to avoid unnecessary
expense and delay, a sketch or schematic design for the construction,
alteration or repair of any regulated activity may be presented to the
Commission. A preliminary design should show the relation to adjacent
structures and spaces. The Commission may advise or recommend
alteration and changes in the application. The applicant shall have the
right to resubmit his application at any time.
D. Any and all applications shall be considered and decided by the majority
vote of the total membership of the Commission at a duly called
meeting of the Commission.
E. The Commission shall establish its own rules of procedure; provided,
however, that all regular or special meetings and public hearings of the
Commission shall be open to the public, and any person or his duly
constituted representative shall be entitled to appear and be heard on
any matter before the Commission prior to the time at which it reaches
its decision.
F. Within a reasonable time after an application is filed, but in any event
within 32 days after such filing, or within such further time as the
applicant may, in writing, allow, the Landmarks Commission shall either
approve the application or, in the alternative, determine that a hearing
is to be held and issue notice of a public hearing within 10 days after
such determination. The failure of the Commission to approve such
plans within 32 days from the date of the filing of the application or the
failure of the Commission to issue a notice of a public hearing within 10
days after the determination to conduct a public hearing, unless
otherwise mutually agreed upon by the applicant and the Commission,
shall be deemed to constitute approval.
§ 264-6 (RESERVED) § 264-7
261:347
§ 264-7. Penalties for offenses.
Failure to comply with any of the provisions of this article shall be deemed a
violation, and the violator shall be liable to a fine of not more than $25, and
each day such violation continues shall constitute a separate violation.
§ 264-8. Relation to Zoning.
The Zoning Ordinance84 of the City of Kingston, New York, shall apply
within the Stockade Area as follows:
§ 264-9. Appeals.
Appeals from action of the Commission under this article shall proceed in
accordance with Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules.
§ 264-10. Expenditure of funds.
Nothing herein shall be deemed to empower the Commission to obligate the
City of Kingston, New York, to the expenditure of funds unless specifically
authorized by law. The Commission may use funds allocated to it by federal,
state or local agencies and from private donations, grants and bequests, in
carrying out its purpose.
§ 264-11. When effective.
This article shall take effect immediately following final passage, public
hearing and approval by the Mayor of the City of Kingston, New York, as
provided by law.
A. The Zoning Ordinance shall not apply except to serve as a guide within
the Stockade Area with respect to limitations on height, building
spacing and yard and parking requirements. These determinations shall
be made pursuant to this article.
B. Other provisions of the Zoning Ordinance related to land use shall
remain in force; and all other controls shall remain in force to the extent
that they do not conflict with the intent and purpose of this article.

CEO shall notify the person of such suspension within a reasonable time
thereafter in writing of the reasons for the suspension. If the violator

CEO may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize
damage to the MS4 or to minimize danger to persons. All costs and
expenses incurred by the City of Kingston to remedy the situation,

reduce an illicit discharge. The CEO will notify a violator in writing of
the proposed termination of its MS4 access and the reasons therefor.
The violator may petition the CEO for a reconsideration and hearing.
Access may be granted by the CEO if he/she finds that the illicit
discharge has ceased and the discharger has taken steps to prevent its

§ 268-13. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence
via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the municipality in person or by
telephone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications
in person or by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed
and mailed to the municipality within three business days of the telephone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial

facility subject to this chapter is a violation of this chapter. A person
who is the operator of a facility subject to this chapter commits an
offense if the person denies the municipality reasonable access to
the facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this chapter.
(6) If the SMO has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued
hereunder, then the SMO may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.

proceedings for a period of not less that 10 nor more than 60 days. The
owner or the City will thereafter petition the court for such additional
like periods of time as may be necessary to complete the action(s)

contemplated by the stipulation, it may then apply to the court for a
release from the stay seeking some relief as is deemed appropriate.

property, the City shall have the initial burden of proof to show by a
preponderance of the evidence that the structure is a specified crime
property.

F. In establishing the amount of any civil penalty requested, the court may
consider any of the following factors, as they may be appropriate, and
shall cite those found applicable:
(1) The actions taken by the owner(s) to mitigate or correct the
problem at the structure;
(2) The financial condition of the owner(s);
(3) Whether the problem at the structure was repeated or continuous;
(4) The magnitude or gravity of the problem;
(5) The economic or financial benefit accruing or likely to accrue to the
owner(s) as a result of the conditions at the structure;
(6) The cooperativeness of the owner(s) with the City;
(7) The cost to the City of investigating and correcting or attempting to
correct the condition;
(8) Any other factors deemed by the court to be relevant.
A. In the event that it is determined that the structure is an immediate
threat to the public safety and welfare, the City may apply to the court
for such interim relief that is deemed by the Common Council and the
Corporation Counsel to be appropriate. In such an event, the
notification procedures set forth in § 277-15A and the limitation of
§ 227-16A need not be complied with.
B. In the event that the Chief of Police determines that a structure is or
has been used as the locale for the manufacture of controlled
substances that involve the use of toxic, flammable or explosive
substances as defined in 49 CFR 172 (1988) and/or processes that, in
the opinion of the Police Department or the Fire Department personnel,
present a continuing threat to the public's safety or welfare, the City
may obtain an order from the court preventing that structure's use or
occupancy for a period of 60 days.

decontaminate it in accordance with guidelines established by the
Health Department.
(2) After cleaning and/or decontaminating the structure, the owner
shall attest in writing on a form to be provided by the City and sent

267:372
§ 277-17. Enforcement of closure order; costs; civil penalty.
to the Chief of the Fire Department that the structure has been
cleaned and/or decontaminated in accordance with the guidelines,
at which time the structure may be reused or reoccupied, provided
that it is not otherwise subject to the provisions of this chapter.
(3) In the event that the owner fails to comply with the provisions of
the subsection (above), the City may seek an order preventing the
use or occupancy of the structure for such further time as, under
the circumstances, it deems appropriate, unless the owner shows
to the satisfaction of the court that the structure no longer presents
a continuing threat to the public's safety or welfare from the toxic,
flammable or explosive substances and/or processes.
A. In the event that a court finds that a structure constitutes specified
crime property as defined in this chapter, the court may order that it be

City a civil penalty of up to $500 per day the owner had knowledge of
activities or conditions at the structure constituting a violation of this
chapter.
B. The court may also authorize the City to physically secure the structure
against use or occupancy in the event that the owner(s) fail to do so
within the time specified by the court. In the event that the City is
authorized to secure the property, all costs reasonably incurred by the
City to effect a closure shall be made an assessment lien upon the
property. As used in this subsection, "costs" means those costs actually
incurred by the City for the physical securing of the structure, as well
as tenant relocation costs given pursuant to Subsection B(3) of this
section.
(1) The City department(s) effecting the closure shall prepare a
statement of costs, and the City shall thereafter submit that
statement to the court for its review. If no objection to the
statement is made within 30 days, a certified copy of the statement,
including legal description of the property shall be forwarded to the
City Assessor, who thereafter shall enter the same in the City's lien
docket.
(2) Liens imposed by this chapter shall be collected in all respects as
provided for water and sewer liens and shall bear interest at the
rate of 9% per year from 10 days after the entry in the lien docket.
(3) A tenant defined by the Real Property Tax Law is entitled to his or
her reasonable relocation costs as those are determined by the
City, if without actual notice the tenant moved in the structure after
either:
(a) An owner or agent received notice of the Chief of Police's
determination pursuant to § 277-15A; or
§ 277-16 (RESERVED) § 277-17
267:373
§ 277-18. Relief from closure order.
Owners of a structure determined to be specified crime property may obtain
relief from the court's judgement if:
§ 277-19. Attorney fees.
In any action seeking the closure of the structure pursuant to this chapter,
the court may, in its discretion, award attorney's fees to the prevailing party.
(b) An owner or agent received notice of an action brought
pursuant to § 277-19.
(4) Any person who is assessed the costs of closure and/or a civil
penalty by the court shall be personally liable for the payment
thereof to the City.
A. They appear and pay all costs associated with the proceedings under
this chapter;
B. They file a bond in such a place and form as the court may by order
direct in an amount not less than the tax-assessed value of the
structure; and keep said bond in force for a period not less than one
year or such period as the court directs;
C. They enter into a stipulation with the City that they will immediately
abate the conditions giving rise to the specified crime property and
prevent the same from being established or maintained thereafter. The
stipulation will then be made part of the court's file. In the event that
the owner violates the terms of the stipulation, the City may thereafter
apply to the court for an order awarding up to the entire amount of the
aforementioned bond to the City as a penalty as well as other relief
including closure for any additional period of up to one year, that is
deemed by the court as appropriate.

General Regulations
§ 318-1. Legislative findings.
§ 318-2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ESTABLISHED PLACE OF BUSINESS  A building or store in which or
where the person transacts business and deals in the goods, wares and
merchandise he hawks, peddles or solicits during regular business hours,
six hours per day for at least 46 weeks in each calendar year, and in which
there is a person or clerk continually in attendance during such hours.
HAWKER and PEDDLER  Includes, except as hereinafter expressly
provided, any person who, from in any public street or public place or
by going from house to house or place of business to place of business,

A. The City of Kingston has broad powers to regulate the use of its city
streets and for the prevention and promotion of the health, safety,
aesthetics and general welfare of its inhabitants. Any use of the streets
for a private business purpose which interferes unduly with the use of
the streets by others for travel must be regulated.
B. It is the purpose and intent of this article to control and regulate the
activities of hawkers, peddlers and solicitors in the City of Kingston.
History has shown that there is a need for investigation and review of
the past conduct of applicants in the interest of promoting public safety
and morals, child welfare, economic well-being and road safety and
usage. This article is intended to protect the peace and security of our
citizens in their homes and neighborhoods; to safeguard consumers
against fraud and inferior goods; and to prevent congestion and unsafe
conditions on the streets and roadways of the City of Kingston. It has
been made with reasonable consideration of the character of our
community and with a view to preserving the character, among other
considerations.
C. The Common Council declares that some hawkers and peddlers keep
and store their merchandise and offer it for sale in an unsanitary
manner. The Council further finds that the presence of hawkers and
peddlers near places of public assemblage where children of school age
and others congregate or are discharged from vehicles or where such
children board vehicles presents a safety hazard and a danger to the
children and the motoring public. The Common Council further finds
that wrappings and coverings, some containing partially unconsumed
items, or the items themselves are often carelessly discarded other than
in receptacles provided for such items, thereby causing an ugly blight
on the city's streets and surrounding properties, with increased
collection costs to the city.

It is hereby found and determined by the Common Council of the City
of Kingston, New York, that the public solicitation of funds from stopped

inimical to the interests of the people of the City of Kingston, New York, and
that there should be adopted, pursuant to § 1640 of the Vehicles and Traffic

from vehicles and the occupants thereof on such public streets, avenues,

or is in the process of moving with traffic, and each such violation shall
constitute a separate offense.

system, including engineering, planning, construction, reconstruction
of sewers, wastewater treatment works and all necessary
appurtenances thereto, including pumping stations, extensions,

other method that can be demonstrated to be appropriate to the level
and type of services provided.

Except as otherwise provided, the City Engineer shall administer,
implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter. Any powers granted
A. This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for users of the publicly
owned treatment works (POTW) for the City of Kingston and enables
the city to comply with all applicable state and federal Laws, including
the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.) and the General
Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR Part 403). The objectives of this
chapter are:
(1) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will
interfere with its operation;
(2) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will
pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters
or otherwise be incompatible with the POTW;
(3) To protect not only POTW personnel who may be effected by
wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment, but the
general public as well;
(4) To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and
sludge generated by the POTW;
(5) To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance and improvement of the POTW; and
(6) To enable the city to comply with its State Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System permit conditions, sludge use and disposal
requirements and any other federal or state laws to which the
POTW is subject.
B. This chapter shall apply to all users of the POTW. This chapter
authorizes the issuance of wastewater discharge permits, provides for
monitoring, compliance and enforcement activities, establishes
administrative review procedures, requires user reporting and provides
for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting
from the establishment of this program.

metallic substances shall be as "total metal," which shall be defined
as the value measured in a sample acidified to a pH value of less
than two SU without prior filtration.
(3) Each contributory industrial user's individual permit will define the
user's specific maximum allowable concentration limit in mg/l. The
individual mass contribution from each discharger used to
calculate the cumulative allocation will be calculated as:
§ 340-18 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 340-18
335:486
Concentration (in mg/l) x industrial contributory maximum
permitted flow
(in MGD) x 8.34 = mass loading (lb/day)
C. The maximum allowable industrial loading for each parameter
identified in Subsection B of this section shall be allocated to industrial
users as follows:
(1) At a minimum, each permitted contributory industrial user shall be
guaranteed the maximum instantaneous effluent concentration for
each parameter as delineated in § 340-18A. Industrial users cannot
discharge above the maximum instantaneous effluent
concentration for zinc without permit authorization.
(2) The City may distribute the remaining capacity of the maximum
allowable industrial loading to permitted contributory industrial
users as a concentration-based limit based on the City's discretion.
All concentration limits allocated, in excess of the maximum
instantaneous effluent concentration delineated in § 340-18A, shall
be allocated at the industrial users maximum permitted flow. The
City shall consider.
(a) The needs of the industrial users;
(b) Historical discharge trends;
(c) Past pollution control efforts of each industrial user as
compared to other industrial users discharging the same
substance;
(d) Potential for growth in the POTW service area;
(e) The potential for more restrictive regulatory requirements to
be placed on the POTW discharge or sludge disposal method;
and
(f) Treatability of the substance.
(3) At no time can the City distribute a total cumulative amount of any
parameter identified in Subsection B of this section greater than
the maximum allowable industrial loading.
(4) To ensure the maximum allowable industrial loading for each
parameter is not violated, the City shall, on a continuing basis,
evaluate each industrial users flows and pollutant levels to assess
whether a modification of its discharge permit must be undertaken.
D. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to relieve any industrial user
from its obligation to comply with applicable Federal Categorical
Pretreatment Standards and discharge permit conditions.
E. Limitations on wastewater strength outlined above may be
supplemented with more stringent limit's when:
§ 340-18 SALES OF MERCHANDISE § 340-18
335:487
(1) The limitations of this chapter are not sufficient to protect the
operation of the POTW, or to protect the treatment works
structures or sewers, or to provide adequate safety to the POTW or
City employees.
(2) The limitations of this chapter are not sufficient to enable the
treatment facility to comply with the water quality standards or
effluent limitations specified in the POTW 's State Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) permit.
(3) In the event more stringent limitations are required, all permit
holders shall be notified in writing a minimum of 30 days in
advance of the effective date. Discharge permits will then be
modified to reflect the more stringent limitations.

steps being taken by the user to return to the established
schedule. In no event shall more than nine months elapse
between such progress reports to the City Engineer.
(h) Signature and certification: all wastewater discharge permit
applications, baseline monitoring reports and any other user
reports must be signed by an authorized representative of the
user and contain the following statement:
I certify under penalty of law that this chapter and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or
supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure
that qualified personnel properly gathered and evaluated the
information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or
persons who manage the system, or those persons directly
responsible for gathering the information, the information
submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant
penalties for submitting false information including the
possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.
B. Periodic compliance reports. All significant industrial users shall, at a
frequency determined by the City Engineer, but in no case less than
twice per year (on June 1 and December 1), submit a report indicating
the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are
limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated
average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic
compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with
Subsection A(2)(h) of this chapter. All wastewater samples must be
representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow
measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean and
maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to
keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds
for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its
discharge. If a user subject to the reporting requirements of this section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the City
Engineer using the procedures prescribed in § 340-28B of this chapter,
the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
§ 340-22 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 340-22

§ 340-23. Flow equalization.
No user shall cause the discharge of slugs to the POTW. Each user
discharging into the POTW greater than 100,000 gallons per day or greater
than 5% of the average daily flow in the POTW, whichever is the lesser, shall
install and maintain on his property and at his expense a suitable storage
and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow over a twenty-fourhour
period. The facility shall have a capacity of at least 50% of the users
daily discharge volume and shall be equipped with alarms and a rate of
discharge controller, the regulation of which shall be directed by the City
Engineer. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow
equalization.
§ 340-24. Measurement of flow.
§ 340-25. Accessible sampling point.
C. Other reports. The City Engineer may impose reporting requirements
equivalent to the requirements imposed by this section on users not
subject to pretreatment standards. More frequent self-monitoring
reports may be required at the discretion of the City Engineer. Such
reports, when required, shall be due on or before the 25th day of each
month.
A. In the event that a person discharging wastes to the POTW produces
evidence to the City Engineer demonstrating that a substantial portion
of the total amount of the metered water does not reach the POTW, then
the City Engineer shall direct the installation of appropriate flow
measuring (and totaling) devices to measure and record the actual
amount of flow into the POTW.
B. In the event that a person discharging water into the POTW procures all
or part of his water supply from unmetered sources, the City Engineer
shall either direct the installation of water meters on the other sources
of water supply or direct the installation of appropriate flow measuring
devices to measure and record the actual amount of flow into the POTW.
C. Any water meters and/or flow measuring devices installed pursuant to
this section shall be of a type and design acceptable to the City
Engineer and shall be installed, maintained and periodically tested, as
required by the City Engineer, by the owner at the owner's expense.
D. All such measuring devices shall be subject to periodic inspection,
testing and reading by the City Engineer.
E. Any person discharging wastes into the POTW may install a flow
measuring device at his option and expense of the type, design,
installation and maintenance standards of the City Engineer.
F. All such meters and/or flow measuring devices shall be kept in proper
working order at all times.
§ 340-22 SALES OF MERCHANDISE § 340-25
335:497
§ 340-26. Proper design and maintenance of facilities and
monitoring stations.
Preliminary treatment and flow equalization facilities or monitoring
stations, if provided for any wastewater, shall be constructed and
continuously maintained in a clean, safe and operational manner by the
owner at his expense. Where an industrial user has such treatment,
equalization or monitoring facilities at the time this chapter is enacted, the
City Engineer may approve or disapprove the adequacy of such facilities.
Where the City Engineer disapproves of such facilities and construction,
new or upgraded facilities for treatment, equalization or monitoring shall
be required. All plans and specifications for such facilities shall be prepared
by a licensed professional engineer and submitted to the City Engineer.
Construction of new or upgraded facilities shall not commence until written
approval of the City Engineer has been obtained.
§ 340-27. Vandalism; tampering with measuring devices.
No person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy,
uncover, deface, tamper with, prevent access to or render inaccurate or
cause or permit the malicious, willful or negligent breaking, damaging,
destroying, uncovering, defacing of, tampering with, preventing access to
or rendering inaccurate of:
§ 340-28. Sampling and analysis.
A. All SIU's and other industrial users whose industrial waste discharge
has caused or may cause interference or pass-through may be required
by the City Engineer to install and maintain an accessible sampling
point on their premises at their expense, to facilitate the observation,
sampling and measurement of their industrial wastewater discharge.
B. If there is more than one discharge line serving an industrial user, the
City Engineer may require the installation of an accessible sampling
point on each discharge line, at the user's expense.
C. The City Engineer may require that such accessible sampling point(s)
include equipment for the continuous measurement and recording of
wastewater flow rate and for the sampling of the wastewater. Such
sampling point(s) shall be accessibly and safely located, and the
industrial user shall allow immediate access, with or without prior
notice, to the sampling point(s) by the City Engineer or his designated
representative.
A. Any structure, appurtenance or equipment which is a part of the city
POTW; or
B. Any measuring sampling and/or testing device or mechanism installed
pursuant to any requirement under this chapter.
§ 340-25 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 340-28
335:498
§ 340-29. Accidental discharges.
A. Analytical requirements All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, that are to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge
permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in
an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136
does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with
procedures approved by the EPA.
B. Sample collection. Except as indicated in this subsection, the user must
collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite
collection techniques. In the event that flow proportional sampling is
not feasible, the City Engineer may authorize the use of time
proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the
user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the
effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to
show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. Samples for oil
and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides and volatile
organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
A. Each user shall protect from accidental discharges of prohibited
materials or materials in volumes or concentrations exceeding
limitations of this chapter or of a wastewater discharge permit,
including slug discharges.
B. When so directed by the City Engineer, each user shall develop and
submit a plan designated as a Spill Prevention Control and
Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan. This plan will set forth detailed
procedures to provide for the protections identified in Subsection A.
Upon submission to the City Engineer the Plan will be reviewed and
approved before implementation by the user.
C. Users shall immediately notify the City Engineer of the discharge of
wastes in violation of this chapter or any permit. Such discharges may
result from breakdown of pretreatment equipment; accidents caused by
mechanical failure or negligence; or other causes. Where possible, such
immediate notification shall allow the City Engineer to initiate
appropriate countermeasure action at the POTW (see § 340-26).
D. The user shall prepare and submit to the City Engineer a detailed
written statement which describes the causes of the discharge and the
measures being taken to prevent future occurrences. Analytical results
and their interpretations may be appended to the report at a date not
exceeding 45 calendar days after the occurrence.
E. Based upon the frequency of the incidents, each SIU shall be evaluated
at least once every two years to determine whether a plan to control
slug discharges must be developed. If it is determined that such a plan

within five days; and
(4) If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental
spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas,
handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading
operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of
containment structures or equipment, measures for containing
toxic organic pollutants (including solvents) and/or measures and
equipment for emergency response.
A. When requested, the City Engineer shall make available to the public,
for inspection and/or copying, information and data on industrial users
obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permit and
monitoring programs and inspections, unless the industrial user
specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the City Engineer that such information, if made public, would divulge
processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade
secrets of the user.
B. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and reports of accidental
discharges will not be recognized as confidential.
C. Confidential information shall not be made available for inspection and/
or copying by the public, but shall be disclosed upon written request to
governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter or the SPDES
permit, provided that the governmental agency making the request
agrees to hold the information confidential, in accordance with state or
federal laws and regulations.

leased by the user.
(5) Such representatives shall additionally have access to and may
copy any records the user is required to maintain under this
chapter.
(6) Where a user has security measures in force which would require
proper identification and clearance before entry into the premises,
the user shall make the necessary arrangements so that, upon
presentation of suitable identification, inspecting personnel will be
permitted to enter without delay for the purpose of performing
their specific responsibilities.
B. Liability of the property owner.
(1) During the performance on private premises of inspections,
sampling or other similar operations referred to in this Article V,
the inspectors shall observe all applicable safety rules established

The City Engineer shall provide public notice of the issuance of a
wastewater discharge permit. Any person, including the user, may petition
the City Engineer to reconsider the terms of a wastewater discharge permit
within 10 days of notice of its issuance. Failure to submit a timely petition
for review shall be deemed to be a waiver of administrative appeal. In its
petition, the appealing party must indicate the wastewater discharge permit
provisions objected to, the reasons for this objection and the alternative
condition, if any, it seeks to place in the wastewater discharge permit.
The effectiveness of the wastewater discharge permit shall not be stayed
pending the appeal. If the City Engineer fails to act within five days, a
request for reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied. Decisions not
to reconsider a wastewater discharge permit, not to issue a wastewater
discharge permit or not to modify a wastewater discharge permit shall be
considered final administrative actions for the purposes of judicial review.
Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final administrative

ARTICLE VI
Enforcement and Penalties
§ 340-34. Notification of violation.
When the City Engineer finds that a user has violated or continues to violate
any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, order issued
hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the City
Engineer may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within 10
days of receipt of said notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan
for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific
required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the City Engineer.
Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
Nothing in this section limits the City Engineer's authority from taking any
emergency or other enforcement action necessary, prior to issuing a notice
of violation.
§ 340-35. Show cause hearing.
The City Engineer may serve notice to order a user who has violated or
continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit, order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, to appear and show cause why enforcement should not be
taken. In addition to the user having to show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken, the notice will specify the time and
place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action and the reasons
for such action. Said notice will be served personally or by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested) at least five days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the
user. A show cause hearing shall not prohibit or be a prerequisite from the
City Engineer taking any other emergency or enforcement action deemed
necessary.
§ 340-36. Consent orders.
The City Engineer may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance or other similar documents establishing an agreement, with any
user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific
action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a period
specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and
effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §§ 340-37 and 340-38
of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable.
§ 340-37. Compliance orders.
When the City Engineer finds that a user has violated or continues to violate
any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, order issued
hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the City
Engineer may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
§ 340-34 SALES OF MERCHANDISE § 340-37
335:503
directing that the user come into compliance within a specified period of
time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided,
sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities,
devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated.
Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management
practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the
sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance
established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a
compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any
continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not prohibit or
be a prerequisite from the City Engineer taking any other emergency or
enforcement action deemed necessary.
§ 340-38. Cease and desist orders.
When the City Engineer finds that a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit order
issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement or
that the users past violations are likely to recur, the City Engineer may
issue an order directing the user to cease and desist all such violations
and to immediately comply with all requirements and take such appropriate
remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a
continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or
terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not
prohibit or be a prerequisite from the City Engineer taking any other
emergency or enforcement action deemed necessary.
§ 340-39. Emergency suspensions.
A. The City Engineer may immediately suspend a user's discharge after
informal notice to the user whenever such suspension is necessary to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to
present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
environment, human health or welfare or threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW.
(1) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City
Engineer may take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection to prevent or
minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream or
endangerment to human health or welfare. The City Engineer may
allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that the
period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination
proceedings in § 340-40 of this chapter are initiated against the
user.
§ 340-37 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 340-39
335:504
§ 340-40. Termination of discharge.
§ 340-41. Injunctive relief.
When the City Engineer finds that a user has violated or continues to violate
any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, order issued
hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the City
Engineer may petition the New York State Supreme Court, through the
Corporation Counsel of the City of Kingston, for the issuance of a temporary
or permanent injunction as appropriate, which restrains or compels the
specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other
requirement imposed by this chapter, on activities of the user. The City
Engineer may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and
/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct
environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not prohibit
or be prerequisite from the City Engineer taking any other action deemed
necessary, against the user.
(2) A user that is responsible in whole or in part for any discharge
presenting endangerment shall submit, prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under §§ 340-35 or 340-40 of
this chapter, a detailed written statement to the City Engineer
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence.
B. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior
to any emergency suspension that is initiated.
A. In addition to the provisions in § 340-21 of this chapter, any user who
violates the following conditions may be subject to discharge
termination, at the discretion of the City Engineer:
(1) Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
(2) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
(3) Failure to report anticipated significant changes in operations,
wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to
discharge;
(4) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
(5) Violation of the pretreatment standards in Article IV of this chapter.
B. Such user shall be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge
and be offered an opportunity to show cause under § 340-35 of this
chapter, why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this
option shall not prohibit or be a prerequisite from the City Engineer
taking any other action deemed necessary against the user.

chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, order issued hereunder or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the City
of Kingston for a maximum civil penalty of not less than $1,000 per
violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long term average
discharge limit violations, penalties shall accrue for each day during the
period of said violation.
B. The City Engineer may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs
and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, as well as any actual damages
incurred by the city.
C. In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into
account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation; the magnitude and duration of
the violation; any economic benefit gained through the user's violation;
corrective actions by the user; the compliance history of the user; and
any other factor as justice requires.
D. Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not prohibit or be a prerequisite
from the City Engineer taking any other action deemed necessary,
against the user.
A. A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this chapter,
a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty
of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000) dollars
per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than one year, or
both. A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into
the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at
least $1,000 or be subject to imprisonment for not more than one year,
or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for
personal injury or property damage available under state law.
B. A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations or
certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other
documentation filed or required to be maintained, pursuant to this
chapter, wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or
who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any
monitoring device or method required under this chapter shall, upon
conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 dollars per
violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.
In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a fine of
not more than $1,000 per violation per day or imprisonment for not
more than one year, or both.
§ 340-42 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 340-44
335:506
§ 340-44. Remedies nonexclusive.
The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The City
Engineer may take any, all or any combination of these actions against a
noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be
in accordance with the city's Enforcement Response Plan. However, the City
Engineer may take other action against any user when the circumstances
warrant. Further, the City Engineer is empowered to take more than one
enforcement action simultaneously against any noncompliant user.
§ 340-45. Article 78 proceeding.
Any penalty or order issued by the City Engineer pursuant to this article
shall be reviewable in a proceeding pursuant to Article 78 of the CPLR.
Application for such review must be made within 60 days after service, in
person or by mail, of a copy of the determination or order upon the attorney
of record of the applicant and of each person who has filed a notice of
appearance or the applicant in person if not directly represented by an
attorney.
§ 340-46. Public notification.
A. The City Engineer shall provide public notification, in the daily
newspaper with largest circulation in the city, of industrial users which
were significantly in violation of local or federal pretreatment standards
or requirements since the last such notice.
B. The frequency of such notice shall be at least once per year.
C. For the purposes of this section, a significant violation shall be one
which causes significant noncompliance with national or local
pretreatment standards. These procedures shall include provision for at
least annual public notification, in the largest daily newspaper in the
municipality in which the POTW is located, of industrial users which, at
any time during the previous 12 months, were in significant
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment requirements. For the
purposes of this provision, an industrial user is in significant
noncompliance if its violation meets one or more of the following
criteria: [Amended 4-5-2011 by L.L. No. 5-2011, approved
4-19-2011]
(1) Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of all measurements taken during a sixmonth

GENERAL REFERENCES
Building construction  See Ch. 172.
Excavation hazards  See Ch. 211.
Illicit discharges  See Ch. 268.
Zoning  See Ch. 405.
§ 353-1. Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
A. Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious
cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and
increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition;
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne
pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other
desirable species;
C. Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion
and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat;
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby
increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation;
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow;
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on
the waters of the municipality;
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from land development activities;
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the
public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety.
I. Regulation of land development activities by means of performance
standards governing stormwater management and site design will
produce development compatible with the natural functions of a
§ 350-30 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 353-1
347:548
§ 353-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the
general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing within this
jurisdiction and to address the findings of fact in § 353-1 hereof. This
chapter seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives:
§ 353-3. Statutory authority.
In accordance with § 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law of the State of
New York, the Common Council of the City of Kingston has the authority
to enact local laws and amend local laws and for the purpose of promoting
the health, safety or general welfare of the City of Kingston and for the
particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse
effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.
A. Meet the requirements of minimum measures 4 and 5 of the SPDES
general permit for stormwater discharges from municipal separate
stormwater sewer systems (MS4s), Permit No. GP-0-10-002 or as
amended or revised;
B. Require land development activities to conform to the substantive
requirements of the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES)
general permit for construction activities GP-0-10-001 or as amended or
revised;
C. Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development
activities in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream
temperature, and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of
stream channels;
D. Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land
development activities which would otherwise degrade local water
quality;
E. Minimize the volume of stormwater runoff which flows from any
specific site during and following development to the maximum extent
practicable; and
F. Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint
source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management
practices and to ensure that these management practices are properly
maintained and eliminate threats to public safety.
G. Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and
maintenance of both structural and nonstructural stormwater control
facilities and management practices to ensure that they continue to
function as designed, are adequately maintained, and pose no threat to
public safety (§ 353-10B and D).

§ 353-9. Stormwater credits.
The DEC has identified a set of six practices which qualify for stormwater
credits. If these practices are implemented as described in the document
titled "The Use and Implementation of Stormwater Credits," they can result
in a calculated reduction in the water quality treatment volume, and
occasionally in the water quantity storage volumes, required for the
projects subject to a full SWPPP.
§ 353-10. Maintenance and repair of stormwater facilities.
A. The six credits are for the following practices:
(1) Natural area conservation.
(2) Stream and wetland buffers.
(3) Vegetated open channels.
(4) Overland flow filtration to groundwater recharge zones.
(5) Environmentally sensitive rural development.
(6) Riparian reforestation.
B. These practices must be implemented as described in "The Use and
Implementation of Stormwater Credits."
C. These practices must be reviewed and approved by the City of Kingston
before the credits can be taken.
D. DEC's procedure for application of these credits is currently evolving.
Projects making use of credits may require a sixty-day review by DEC
and/or a letter from the City of Kingston certifying that the credit has
been applied correctly.
E. Applicants should make use of these credits wherever site conditions
permit.
A. Maintenance during construction.
(1) The applicant or developer of the land development activity shall at
all times properly operate and maintain all facilities and systems of
treatment and control (and related appurtenances) which are
installed or used by the applicant or developer to achieve
compliance with the conditions of this chapter. Sediment shall be
removed from sediment traps or sediment ponds whenever their
design capacity has been reduced by 50%.
(2) The applicant or developer or their representative shall be on site
at all times when construction or grading activity takes place and
shall inspect and document the effectiveness of all erosion and
sediment control practices. Inspection reports shall be completed
every seven days and within 24 hours of any storm event producing

347:559
§ 353-11. Construction inspection.
0.5 inch of precipitation or more. The reports shall be maintained
and stored at the project site and copies made available to
stormwater management officer upon request.
B. Maintenance easement(s). Prior to the issuance of any approval that
has a stormwater management facility as one of the requirements, the
applicant or developer must execute a maintenance easement
agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent landowners served
by the stormwater management facility. The easement shall provide for
access to the facility at reasonable times for periodic inspection by the
City of Kingston to ensure that the facility is maintained in proper
working condition to meet design standards and any other provisions
established by this chapter. The easement shall be recorded by the
grantor in the office of the County Clerk after approval by the counsel
for the City of Kingston.
C. Maintenance after construction. The owner or operator of permanent
stormwater management practices installed in accordance with this
chapter shall operate and maintain the stormwater management
practices to achieve the goals of this chapter. Proper operation and
maintenance also includes, as a minimum, the following:
(1) A preventive/corrective maintenance program for all critical
facilities and systems of treatment and control (or related
appurtenances) which are installed or used by the owner or
operator to achieve the goals of this chapter.
(2) Written procedures for operation and maintenance and training
new maintenance personnel.
(3) Discharges from the SMPs shall not exceed design criteria or cause
or contribute to water quality standard violations in accordance
with § 353-8B.
D. Maintenance agreements. The City of Kingston may require a formal
maintenance agreement for stormwater management facilities binding
on all subsequent landowners and recorded in the office of the County
Clerk as a deed restriction on the property prior to final plan approval.
The maintenance agreement shall be consistent with the terms and
conditions of Schedule B of this chapter entitled "Sample Stormwater
Control Facility Maintenance Agreement."130 The City of Kingston, in
lieu of a maintenance agreement, at its sole discretion, may accept
dedication of any existing or future stormwater management facility,
provided that such facility meets all the requirements of this chapter
and includes adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by

As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ADA 2010  Americans with Disabilities Act Standards for Accessible
Design. Also may refer to the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility
Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG), as supplemented by the
2011 Proposed Public Right-of-Way Accessibility Guidelines (PROWAG) for

§ 358-2. Guidelines.
A. As described in the New York State Department of Transportation
(NYSDOT) Highway Design Manual, Chapter 18, Pedestrian Facility
Design Revision 83, designers should provide sidewalks when adjacent
land use includes pedestrian generators and destinations within close
proximity to one another and/or where municipal or Regional/
Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) transportation studies
indicate the need for pedestrian facilities. The need for sidewalks
should be evaluated according to the Capital Projects Complete Streets
Checklist and documented in all project scoping reports and design
reports. (See NYSDOT Highway Design Manual Chapter 18.)
B. To plan the location of new sidewalks, designers should refer to the City
of Kingston Comprehensive Plan, the Capital Projects Complete Streets
Checklist, including the logical terminus principle, and consult with the
City of Kingston Planning Department and/or Planning Board.
Specifically, the Kingston Comprehensive Plan 2025 provides guidelines
and goals in regard to sidewalks for differing districts within the City. It
§ 355-69 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 358-2
347:594
§ 358-3. Sidewalk Types.
should be noted that pedestrian facilities constructed under the terms
of highway work permits must adhere to the NYSDOT Highway Design
Manual. Sidewalks should be terminated by an accessible route
connecting the sidewalk to the roadway shoulder or an existing
pedestrian facility.
C. "Green streets" guidelines, including stormwater management best
management practices (BMPs), as described in the City of Kingston
Comprehensive Plan Strategies 5 and 7, should be reviewed for
potential implementation whenever new sidewalks are installed or
when repairs or renovations to more than 50% of existing sidewalk
along a property are made.
D. Existing, deteriorated, or nonaccessible sidewalks (those not meeting
the minimum requirements of current ADA 2010/ADAAG standards)
shall be rehabilitated or replaced, in accordance with the City of
Kingston ADA Transition Plan. Incomplete, but warranted, pedestrian
facility systems should be made complete and should have logical
termini. Existing but unnecessary sidewalks may be eliminated.
However, if they are left in place, they must be made accessible. In
districts without sidewalks, a shoulder area meeting ADA 2010/ADAAG
accessibility requirements can be created. Any decision to remove an
existing sidewalk must be approved by the City of Kingston Planning
Board.
A. Sidewalks within the City of Kingston are to be constructed of one of
two material types: concrete and bluestone.
B. A local variety of stone, commonly known as "bluestone," shall, when at
all practicable, be utilized as sidewalk paving material for new
construction and retained where it presently exists in the following
areas. All bluestone sidewalk installation and repair shall adhere to the
standards within this code. Applications for variance from these
requirements shall be submitted to the Planning Department, Historic
Landmarks Preservation Commission and the Superintendent of Public
Works exercising the judgment as to where it is practicable, with review
by the Mayor.

shown on the map of same annexed as Attachment 6:4.143
(5) All those areas or individual properties that may be so designated
presently or in the future as either a local landmark or a property
listed on the State or National Historic Register.
(6) In areas of the City that are not designated as historic districts or a
landmark and where there are long stretches of historic bluestone,
reusing salvaged historic bluestone from the stretch itself or from
the City's bluestone bank shall be considered where practicable.
C. The material for the primary path of travel on all new sidewalks within
the City of Kingston and outside of historic districts and landmarks
described in Subsection B above shall be of concrete and according to
the standards of this code. Existing sidewalks to be repaired shall be
repaired with concrete and according to the standards of this code. If
existing sidewalks outside of the boundaries described in Subsection B
above are of a bluestone material, they may be repaired with bluestone
that meets all standards set in this code. An application for a variance
from these requirements, including for historic renovation, must be
made to the Superintendent of Public Works, in consultation with the
Planning Department and Historic Landmarks Preservation
Commission.
D. All sidewalks are to meet ADA 2010 requirements for width, surface
variation, curb ramps, detectable warning panels, and all other
accommodations described therein. Sidewalk widths may conform to
the convention and character of adjacent properties and the
surrounding neighborhood or zoning district.
(1) An application for a variance from the minimum width guideline
must be made to the Planning Board and include a site plan and
narrative documenting the reasons for the request. Where the
minimum recommended five-foot width is not possible due to site
conditions, a four-foot width sidewalk may be installed, subject to
approval by the Planning Board, with minimum five-foot square
passing areas spaced no more than 200 linear feet apart, as per
ADA 2010.
(2) If the sidewalk is greater than the five-foot minimum width,
alternate paving types, such as brick or pavers, may be utilized
outside of the minimum width. Street furnishings such as bike
racks, benches, or other amenities may also be placed within the
sidewalk, provided a minimum clear width of four feet is
maintained.
E. Any person, persons or corporation who violates any of the provisions of
this section shall be subject to a penalty not exceeding $50 per day from
142. Editor's Note: Said map is on file in the City offices.

narrative documenting the lack of pedestrian traffic and adjacency of
existing sidewalks for review by the Planning Department.
C. Permit required; application, issuance and duration of permit. No such
sidewalk shall be constructed or work commenced until the owner of
said premises shall have obtained a permit for the sidewalk. In all cases
in which a sidewalk has heaved due to tree roots, prior approval for any
work shall be obtained from the City of Kingston Tree Commission
through the permitting process. Application for such permit shall be in
person at the office of the Department of Public Works of the City of
Kingston, New York, during regular office hours. A nonrefundable
application fee for such permit in an amount as set forth in the fee
schedule established by resolution of the Common Council of this City
shall be charged.144 Said permit shall be valid for 60 days from the date
of final approval.

installed according to the standards within this code or through
written approval of a variance by the Superintendent of Public
Works in consultation with the City Engineer and Historic
Landmarks Commission.
(2) An existing bluestone sidewalk slab shall be considered to be in
satisfactory condition if it:
(a) Is free from structural defect (displaced cracks, delamination).
(b) Has surface imperfections that are no more than 1/4 inch
vertical.
§ 358-5 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 358-5
347:598
(c) Has a vertical alignment of no more than 1/4 inch difference at
joint or adjoining slab.
(d) Has a horizontal center alignment of no more than one inch
offset from the center line of the sidewalk (except where the
sidewalk must pass an obstruction such as a tree).
(3) Repair and/or replacement.
(a) Repair.
[1] If less than 59% of the length of a City sidewalk (measured
as total length of City sidewalk abutting property) does not
meet City of Kingston specifications, the defective section
of sidewalk may be repaired without disturbance to the
remaining sidewalk.
[2] The installation method (processed stone or concrete
setting method) shall be determined based upon adjacent
undisturbed bluestone panels. The installation method
shall match the structural section of the adjacent
undisturbed bluestone panels, provided that section meets
the standards of this code. If the adjacent section does not
meet the standards of this code, the bluestone shall be set
on processed stone.
[3] If bluestone paving was previously installed at a drive
apron and is in need of repair, it shall be replaced by either
concrete sidewalk or stamped concrete sidewalk as
described in Subsection C(4) below.
(b) Replacement.
[1] If 59% or more of the length of a City sidewalk (measured
as total length of City sidewalk abutting property) does not
meet City of Kingston specifications, all bluestone slabs
abutting the property shall be removed. Existing slabs
meeting the standards of this code may be reset according
to one of the acceptable methods outlined below.
[2] The property owner may choose which installation method
(processed rock or concrete setting method) is used. If a
contractor intends to reuse existing subbase material, it
shall be inspected for conformity to standards by the

partially or fully constructed of bluestone, the repair procedure
shall be as follows:
[1] If 50% or more of the length of the City sidewalk
(measured as total length of City sidewalk abutting
property) is constructed of bluestone, the disturbed
sidewalk panel must be replaced with bluestone
notwithstanding from which type of material the disturbed
panel was originally constructed. The Superintendent of
Public Works may waive this requirement at the written
request of the property owner. The entity disturbing the
sidewalk shall verify the replacement material with the
property owner prior to repairing the disturbed slab(s).

§ 360-36. Exemption granted.
Real property listed on the National and Local Historic Register within the
City of Kingston which is altered or rehabilitated subsequent to the effective
date of this article shall be exempt from City real property and special ad
valorem levies, subject to and in accordance with the schedule set forth in
Subsection A and conditions outlined in Subsection B and § 360-37.
A. This real property tax exemption for historic properties is being
enacted in order to achieve the following goals: to increase incentives
for property owners in historic districts to invest in the upkeep and
rehabilitation of properties; to provide an incentive for the restoration
and rehabilitation of commercial structures which qualify as landmarks
in order to provide financial advantages, not available elsewhere in the
City at this time, which may help to attract and retain businesses in the
City of Kingston; to assist homeowners who are interested in restoring
their own properties, but may not be able to afford to do so when faced
with potential increases in taxation as the result of alterations which
would qualify for this exemption; to provide financial incentives for
investment in low-income residential neighborhoods which may contain
landmarked buildings or districts designated within the area; and to
provide a concrete benefit to offset the possible financial disadvantage
of owning historically or architecturally significant properties which are
subject to the regulation of the City's Historic Landmarks Preservation
Commission.
B. The City of Kingston real property tax exemption for historic properties
is intended to apply to alterations or rehabilitations of historic property
as authorized pursuant to §§ 96-a and 119-aa through 119-dd of the
General Municipal Law and § 444-a of the Real Property Tax Law and all
other powers granted to the City of Kingston to provide such
exemptions.

preserves or increases the historic character of real property located

alteration or rehabilitation pursuant to the following schedule:

B. No such exemption shall be granted for such alterations or
rehabilitation unless all of the following criteria are met:
(1) Such property must be historic, which shall mean that the property
has been designated as a landmark or is a property that is located
in and contributes to the character of a designated historic district,
created by a local law which was passed pursuant to § 96-a or

preservation law.
(3) Alterations and rehabilitation of exteriors are approved by the
City's Historic Landmarks Preservation Commission prior to

(4) Alteration or rehabilitation must be for the purpose of historic
preservation. For purposes of qualifying for a real property tax
exemption pursuant to this local law, alterations and rehabilitation
shall be deemed to be for the purpose of historic preservation if it
involves only exterior work that enhances the structural stability or
structural integrity of the property.

TREES
§ 373-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Municipal Street Tree Ordinance of the
City of Kingston."
§ 373-2. Legislative finding of fact.
§ 373-3. Purpose.
Indiscriminate and uncontrolled destruction of trees deprives the
community of these benefits. The purpose of this chapter is to preserve
trees, minimize damage and removal and encourage planting of trees,
thereby enhancing the health, safety and general welfare of the inhabitants
of the City of Kingston. This chapter is an amplification of the City Charter
Tree Protection Ordinance, as defined in the Charter of the City of Kingston
under the title "Trees and Plantings."
§ 373-4. Definitions.
For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
given herein:
A. It is hereby found and declared that the City of Kingston, New York, is
especially situated in an area covered with a wide variety of trees and
shrubs that are a particularly vital part of the heritage passed on to us
by nature and our forefathers considering the city's original Dutch
name of "Wiltwyck," meaning wild woods.
B. Trees provide a vital ecological resource for the well-being of the
community and therefore require preservation efforts. Trees stabilize
the soil on slopes thereby preventing siltation, erosion and flooding;
they control water pollution; they purify the air and generate oxygen;
they mitigate noise; their shade reduces energy consumption; they
provide habitat and food for birds and animals; and their colorful
seasonal characteristics enrich our total environment.
C. Trees are economically beneficial in attracting new industry, residents
and visitors. Healthy trees of the right size and species enhance the
value and marketability of property and promote the stability of
neighborhoods.

GENERAL REFERENCES
Streets and sidewalks  See Ch. 355.
Sidewalk standards  See Ch. 358.
Trees  See Ch. 373.
§ 374-1. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
BARE-ROOT PLANTING  Shade tree roots are found primarily in the top
12 inches of soil. Tiny absorbing roots, responsible for most of the tree's
intake of water and nutrients, are in the top several inches of soil and can
grow horizontally for quite a distance. Bare-root shipping saves these roots
and protects them with hydrogel. It allows the shipping of trees for less cost,
with much less weight.
CALIPER  Diameter of trunk six inches above the root flare.
COMPOST  A mixture of organic matter, as from leaves, bark, manure,
food waste, etc., that has decayed or has been digested by organisms. It is
used to improve soil structure and provide nutrients. Good compost should
(11) Pear - pyrus species (not including those varieties commonly
referred to as "flowering").
(12) Plum - prunus species (not including those varieties commonly
referred to as "flowering").
§ 373-10 (RESERVED) § 374-1
366:691
be dark brown to black, the color of 70% cocoa dark chocolate. Individual
pieces in the compost, when broken apart, should be the same color inside
as outside.
DRAINAGE  The water that has passed through the surface of the
permeable paving or soil pit and has either overflowed or has been
recollected in underdrain pipes. The excess water discharges to the storm
sewer network.
GIRDLING ROOTS  Roots that circle the main stem that encircle, or will
in the future encircle, the tree as it grows larger. Girdling roots limit root
infrastructure, leading to tree instability.
PERCOLATION  The rate at which stormwater moves through (drains) a
soil or particular location.
PERMEABLE CONCRETE  A mixture of Portland cement, fly ash, washed
gravel and water. The water to cementitious material ratio is typically 0.35
- 0.45 to 1 (NRMCA, 2004). Permeable concrete has greater void space
than traditional concrete, allowing water to infiltrate directly through the
pavement surface to the subsurface.
PLANTING SOIL  Mixed soil for use in planting trees. Planting soil shall
be created from combinations of existing soil, soil loam, sand and organic
matter.
STRUCTURAL SOIL  A mixture of crushed gravel, soil, and clay. The soil
allows roots to grow by transferring compactive load from stone to stone
with the soil in between remaining uncompacted. The clay content serves to
retain moisture.
TRAINING  Will constitute the following: International Society of
Arboriculture (ISA) certified arborist or other equivalent professional
certification or attendance at a workshop sponsored by Cornell Cooperative
Extension, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation
(DEC), United States Forest Service (USFS), or equivalent covering tree
planting, pruning, and basic tree care.
TREE PIT  A minimum three-foot-by-three-foot existing planting pit whose
surface may be mulched or covered by a tree grate. New tree pits will have
minimum dimensions of four feet by five feet by three feet (LxWxH).
§ 374-2. Tree planting at sidewalks.
A. Location of trees along sidewalks. A tree shall not be planted (or
replanted) unless a minimum approvable pedestrian travel width of four
feet adjacent to the tree is available, allowing for a minimum three-footby-
five-foot planting pit. Trees should be spaced approximately 30 feet
apart, and approximately 15 feet from any hydrant, utility pole, light
pole, or other infrastructure, whenever practicable.
B. Tree species and sizes to be used along sidewalks. See Kingston Tree
Commission guidelines for species, size to be no greater than 2.5
inches' caliper. Recommend bare-root trees when practicable. Trees
§ 374-1 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 374-2
366:692
shall be obtained from a licensed nursery and shall be in good health,
free from structural flaws and girdling roots.
C. Repairs to sidewalks in cases of upheaval due to tree roots. In all cases
in which a sidewalk has heaved due to tree roots, prior approval for any
work shall be obtained from the City of Kingston Tree Commission
through the DPW sidewalk permitting process.
D. Planting trees along sidewalks. Two key ways to prevent sidewalk
damage, reduce maintenance requirements, and maintain tree health
are: to increase available space for roots, and to encourage healthy root
structure. The following requirements address these issues for the
long-term benefit of Kingston's streetscapes. For additional proper tree
planting specifications, go to Chapter 373, Trees, of the Code of the City
of Kingston.
(1) For placement of trees in existing tree pits or tree lawn, the
following Virginia Tech Soil Profile Rebuilding Method should be
used to break up compacted soil:
(a) Mix in four inches of compost to a depth of two feet.
(b) Apply four inches of topsoil and mix in to a depth of six to eight
inches; topsoil shall have a minimum of 3% organic matter.
(c) Plant tree in a hole three times the width and 1.5 times the
depth of the roots of the tree.
(d) Rootball shall be planted on unexcavated or tamped soil to
prevent settlement. Root flare shall be aligned with finish
grade.
(2) Percolation tests shall be performed on a minimum of 10% of tree
pits (lawns) or at least one representative planting site for a
particular project, or on any areas of questionable drainage as
required by a City Forester or Arborist or other qualified and
properly trained City representative. If the percolation rate is
found to be less than two inches per hour, soil rebuilding or special
drainage such as underdrains may be necessary, to be determined
through consultation with the City of Kingston Tree Commission.
(3) Where tree pits are installed in heavy pedestrian traffic areas or
along sidewalk segments with reduced width, tree grates or other
surfacing over tree pits may be necessary or desirable. Any tree
grate or other surfacing material to be installed over a tree pit
along a sidewalk shall be submitted to the Kingston Tree
Commission and the Superintendent of Public Works for approval.
(a) Tree grates shall be designed to withstand a minimum of Class
B, medium-duty loading, and shall have a minimum center
opening of 18 inches by 18 inches.
§ 374-2 (RESERVED) § 374-2
366:693
(b) Porous paving solutions such as Flexi®-Pave or an equal
alternative may be proposed in lieu of a tree grate, subject to
the approval of the Superintendent of Public Works and the
Planning Department.
(c) Site furnshings for tree protection, such as tree fences, guards,
or other barriers, must be approved by the Planning
Department and the Kingston Tree Commission prior to
installation.
(4) In locations where tree pits or a narrow tree lawn exists between
the sidewalk and the street with adjacent private green space
nearby, and an existing tree is replaced due to sidewalk damage, or
a new tree is planted concurrent with sidewalk replacement, two
sidewalk slabs, each typically four feet by five feet (to five feet by
five feet) in size, shall be removed and no less than a thirty-inch
depth of structural soil, as defined above, placed under the
replaced sidewalk slabs. Applications for variance from these
standards may be submitted for review to the City of Kingston Tree
Commission in consultation with the Superintendent of Public
Works.
(a) Where practicable, permeable concrete shall be utilized as the
sidewalk material for the replacement slabs.
(b) Seams between bluestone slabs and nonporous concrete
should be as tight as possible and sealed against water entry in
order to discourage surface roots.
(c) Under special circumstances, a minimum of one five-foot-byfive-
foot slab with 36 inches of underlying structural soil, as
defined above, may be approved. Any requests for such
approval shall be made to the Superintendent of Public Works.
(5) In areas of newly constructed concrete sidewalk with existing
adjacent trees or that will have newly planted trees, permeable
concrete pavement shall be used, where practicable, for a
minimum of five linear feet in each direction from the center of the
tree. Applications for variance from this standard may be submitted
for review to the City of Kingston Tree Commission in consultation
with the Superintendent of Public Works.
(a) Permeable concrete is a mixture of Portland cement, fly ash,
washed gravel and water. The water to cementitious material
ratio is typically 0.35 - 0.45 to 1 [National Ready-Mix Concrete
Association (NRMCA), 2004]. A fine, washed gravel, less than
13 mm in size (No. 8 or 89 stone) is added to the concrete
mixture to increase the void pace. All permeable concrete
pavement is to be laid at a minimum four inches' thickness,
with 20% - 25% void structure.
§ 374-2 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 374-2
366:694
[1] All permeable concrete to be used in sidewalk applications
in the City of Kingston shall meet ASTM C1688. A design
mix reviewed and stamped by a licensed professional
engineer attesting to such shall be submitted to the
Superintendent of Public Works prior to construction.
[2] Permeable concrete may be poured on site, or precast
modular permeable concrete such as StormcreteTM (or
equal) may be used. In areas outside of the minimum fivefoot
sidewalk width, modular paver systems such as
PaveDrain® (or equal) may be installed. The design mix
for any permeable concrete material to be poured on site
and/or product information regarding precast materials
must be submitted to the Superintendent of Public Works
for approval prior to construction.
[3] All permeable concrete shall be placed on a minimum
thirty-inch depth of structural soil or other free-draining
material as recommended by NYSDOT and approved by
the Superintendent of Public Works.
[4] After installation, permeable concrete shall be tested
according to ASTM C1701-09 for permeability.
(b) All areas of new sidewalk adjacent to new or existing trees
shall, where practicable, have a minimum volume of 75 cubic
feet of planting soil and 375 cubic feet of structural soil placed
as the base at a minimum 30 inches' depth. Appeals for
variance from these depth and volume requirements may be
granted by the City of Kingston Tree Commission.
E. Planting soil.
(1) NYSDOT Item 610.14000011, Structural Soil Mix.
(a) Mix by dry weight to be 80% washed two-inch stone, 20% soil.
The soil shall be clay loam containing at least 20% clay to
maximize water and nutrient holding capacity with a small
amount of hydrogel to aid uniform blending of the two
materials.
(b) Submit mix prior to installation for approval by the Department
of Public Works.
(c) A list of vendors of the above soil type can be obtained from the
City of Kingston Department of Public Works.
(2) Planting soil shall be created from combinations of existing soil,
soil loam, sand and organic matter. All organic matter contents
shall be determined on a dry weight basis. Final soil blend should
have a pH between 5.5 and 7.5. It is to be mixed mechanically or by
hand in the following proportions:

Immobilization, Removal and Storage of Vehicles
[Amended 8-1-2006 by L.L. No. 4-2006, approved 8-18-2006]
§ 390-79. Authority to impound vehicles.
When any vehicle is parked or abandoned on any street, highway or parking
area within this City during a snowstorm, flood, fire or other public
emergency which affects that portion of the public street, highway or
parking area upon which said vehicle is parked or abandoned, or when any
vehicle is found unattended on any street, highway or parking lot within
the City where said vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic or when any
vehicle is parked or abandoned on any street, highway or parking lot within
this City where stopping, standing or parking is prohibited, said vehicle may
be removed by or under the direction of the Police Department of the City
of Kingston.
§ 390-79.1. Legislative findings; purpose.
§ 390-80. Immobilization and impounding of vehicles authorized.
A. The Common Council of the City of Kingston finds that significant
numbers of vehicle owners fail to respond to parking summonses issued
for violations of parking orders, rules, regulations, ordinances and local
laws; that a significant number of such owners are persistent violators;
and that by reason of out-of-state registration of such vehicles, transfer
of ownership and reregistration of such vehicles and other devices,
violators frequently are able to evade existing enforcement measures.
B. By reason of the foregoing, the Common Council of the City of Kingston
finds that the health, welfare and safety will be served by adoption of a
local law providing additional means of enforcing parking orders, rules,
regulations, ordinances, and local laws in the case of vehicle owners
who fail to timely respond to summonses issued for parking violations.
C. The Common Council of the City of Kingston does hereby ordain and
enact this article to accomplish the aforesaid purposes.
A. The Chief of Police, Comptroller or designee hereby is authorized to
provide for the immobilization of vehicles against which three or more
parking summonses have been issued if two or more of such
summonses have not been answered within 45 days of the appearance
date or dates shown on such summonses.
B. Such vehicles may be immobilized and left where found, secured by the
use of a steel lock or such other immobilization device as may be
designated by the Chief of Police, Comptroller or designee.
C. Such immobilization shall be at the expense of the owner of the vehicle.

§ 390-81. Notice and warning to owner.
§ 390-81.1. Tampering or attempted removal; penalties for offenses.
§ 390-81.2. Vehicle release to owner.
D. Any vehicle that has been immobilized and not lawfully released or
lawfully removed by the owner of the vehicle for 72 hours from the time
of such initial immobilization may be impounded by the Chief of Police,
which removal, boot release fee and storage shall be at the expense of
the owner of the vehicle.
E. Storage and charges for storage and removal of vehicles for other than
parking summonses shall be as provided in § 390-64.
A. When an immobilization device is used, the Police Department, or its
agents, or Parking Violations Bureau employees shall attach to the
vehicle, in such form as may be directed by the Chief of Police,
Comptroller or designee, a notice containing the following information:
(1) The location and identifying characteristics of the vehicle.
(2) The date and time of placement of the device and the signature of
the installer.
(3) Notice that further parking restrictions will be waived during the
immobilization period for a period of five days from the date of
immobilization.
(4) Notice that any person tampering with the device or the vehicle
will be subject to criminal prosecution and liable for any loss to the
City.
(5) The steps which the owner must take to obtain the release of the
vehicle.
(6) Such other information, statements, notices and warnings as the
Chief of Police, Comptroller or designee may from time to time
determine to be appropriate.
B. Notice of removal of a vehicle and recovery of the vehicle by the owner
for other than parking summonses shall be as provided in § 390-64.
A. No person shall attempt to or tamper with, deface, remove or destroy
an immobilization device or move a vehicle immobilized as herein
provided.
B. A violation of this section shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding
$250 or by imprisonment for up to 10 days, or both.
A. Any vehicle immobilized as herein provided shall be promptly released
to its owner upon:
§ 390-80 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 390-81.2
386:750
(1) Payment of the expenses of immobilization which hereby are found
to be $40; and either
(2) An order of the City Court authorizing such release; or
(3) The owner furnishing security for appearance in City Court to
answer parking summonses outstanding against such vehicle and
the expense of immobilization.
B. The amount of such security shall not exceed the total of the maximum
fines permitted upon conviction of the offenses charged in outstanding
summonses against the vehicle or the vehicle owner's failure to timely
answer, plus the expense of immobilization.
C. Any police officer on desk duty at the Kingston Police Station or Parking
Enforcement Officer, or Parking Violation Bureau Employee(s) of the
Comptroller's Office of the City of Kingston shall be authorized to
establish a date for the vehicle owner's appearance in Kingston City
Court to answer outstanding parking summonses, to determine the
amount of security required and to accept same together with the
expense of immobilization. In determining the amount of such security,
consideration shall be given to the likelihood of the vehicle owner
appearing in Kingston City Court to answer outstanding summonses
and the number of outstanding summonses involved. Security payments
shall be promptly transmitted to the Kingston City Court.
D. While a vehicle is immobilized as herein provided, any parking
restrictions of which such vehicle may be in violation, except as
provided herein, shall be suspended as they apply to such vehicle for a
period of three days from the initial date of immobilization.

coincide with property lines, the center lines of streets, alleys,
watercourses and the main track or tracks of railroads.

distance from a street line, such boundary line shall be deemed to be
parallel to such street line.
C. Where such boundaries are indicated as approximately following the
property lines of parks or other publicly or institutionally owned lands,
such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
D. In all cases where, on the effective date of this chapter, a district
boundary divides a lot, other than a through lot, in one ownership, in
such a way that 50% or more or such lot lies in the less restricted
district, the regulations prescribed by this chapter for such less
restricted district shall apply to such portion of the more restricted
portion of said lot which lies within 30 feet of such district boundary.
For purposes of this section, the more restricted district shall be
deemed that district which is subject to regulations which prohibit the
particular use intended to be made of said lot or which regulations set
higher standards with respect to setback, coverage, yards, screening,
landscaping and similar requirements.
E. In all cases where a district boundary line is located not farther than 15
feet away from a lot line of record, the regulations applicable to the
greater part of the lot may be deemed to apply to the entire lot.

needed to provide efficient operation;
[2] Rehabilitation and alteration of existing marinas;
[3] Open water facilities;

of wave action within the protected basin. Minimum design
criteria to promote a flushing include:
[1] Basin and channel depths shall not be deeper than the
prevailing depths in the water body to which they connect.
[2] Basin and channel depths shall gradually increase toward
open water or basin entrances.
[3] Openings shall be provided at the opposite ends of
enclosed basins to establish flow-through circulation. Only
one opening must be navigable. The other opening or
openings shall be as large as practicable to promote
circulation. Culverts or other enclosed conduits may be
used in place of open channels.
[4] The configuration chosen shall minimize or prevent the
formation of stagnant water zones that tend to collect
debris or cause shoaling or flushing problems.
(e) Marinas shall be located in areas where minimal physical
attributes required by marinas already exist and where
minimal initial and subsequent maintenance dredging will be
required. Such physical attributes include natural depths at or
exceeding minimal navigable depths, low rates of sediment
transport and sufficient tidal action to promote flushing.
Dredging shall be limited to the minimum dimensions
necessary for the project. The City may authorize dredging or
other marina activities only on a seasonally restricted basis in
the Rondout Significant Fish and Wildlife Habitat. Marinas
shall not be permitted in areas that would require frequent
maintenance dredging that would harm aquatic life or would
prevent the relocation of benthic organisms. Such areas would
include those which would require maintenance dredging more
often than once every five years.
(f) Applicants must demonstrate that there is an adequate water
supply to serve all of the projects needs.
(g) Sewage pumpout facilities shall be provided at new marinas
and expansion of existing marinas at a minimum rate of one
pumpout station for every 100 wet slips, or fraction thereof.
(h) Adequate rest room facilities for the exclusive use of marina
patrons will be required to discourage any overboard
discharge of sewerage from boats and to protect water quality.
The number of toilets required for any given marina shall be
determined by the nature and size of the marina and by its
specific site locations.
§ 405-25 (RESERVED) § 405-25
401:991
(i) The applicant must demonstrate adequate capacity to properly
dispose of or treat all sanitary wastes generated by the project.
(j) An ample number of signs must be provided to identify the
location of public rest rooms and of pumpout facilities. Signs
must also fully explain the procedures and rules governing the
use of the pumpout facilities. Pumpout facilities shall be
available to all boaters, regardless of whether they are patrons
of the marina.
(k) Dedicated parking spaces shall be provided at a minimum rate
of 0.60 spaces/slip plus whatever additional spaces are
required for employees and required by this Code for separate
retail activities on premises.
(l) Rainfall runoff becomes polluted with oils, greases, organic
and inorganic wastes and other potentially harmful
substances. It is the intent of the City of Kingston to limit, to
the extent feasible, the introduction of these contaminants into
the waters surrounding the City. Therefore, new parking areas
shall utilize porous pavements or other approved measures to
reduce rainfall runoff. New marina projects must incorporate
best management practices in their design, including, but not
limited to, the following:
[1] Maximize pervious land surface and vegetative cover to
minimize stormwater runoff and to prevent polluted
waters from reaching adjacent waters and wetlands.
Direct runoff away from adjacent waters and wetlands to
the extent feasible by site grading or other methods.
[2] Runoff from parking lot maintenance, fueling and
washdown areas must be provided and treated in a
manner that prevents oils, grease and detergents from
reaching adjacent waters and wetlands. Accepted
treatment methods include oil and grease filtering catch
basins, retention areas and exfiltration systems.
(m) Trash receptacles shall be plentiful and convenient to
encourage the proper disposal of trash and waste. A maximum
spacing of 100 feet between receptacles shall be maintained on
all piers and docks.
(n) The underwater positions of piers and docks, including piles,
shall not be constructed using creosote-treated lumber.
(o) All marinas shall institute spill prevention emergency response
plans. Automatic cutoffs for hoses in the event of an accident
are mandatory.

A. Findings. The Common Council of the City of Kingston finds that the
potential and/or actual damages from flooding and erosion may be a
problem to the residents of the City of Kingston and that such damages
may include: destruction or loss of private and public housing, damage
to public facilities, both publicly and privately owned, and injury to and
loss of human life. In order to minimize the threat of such damages and
to achieve the purposes and objectives hereinafter set forth, this
section is adopted.
§ 405-25 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-26
401:994
B. Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this section to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed to:
(1) Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property
due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;
(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation of floodwaters;
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which
may increase erosion or flood damages;
(5) Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally
divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
(6) Qualify for and maintain participation in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
C. Objectives. The objectives of this section are to:
(1) Protect human life and health;
(2) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
(3) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general
public;
(4) Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, sewer lines, streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
(6) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize
future flood blight areas;
(7) Provide that developers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
(8) Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.

D. Definitions. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in
this section shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they
have in common usage and to give this section its most reasonable
application.
APPEAL  A request for a review of the local administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this section or a request for a
variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO, AH or VO Zone
on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one-percent
or greater annual chance of flooding to an average annual depth of one
foot to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where
the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be
evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  The land in the floodplain
within a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. This area may be designated as Zone A,
AE, AH, AO, A1-A30, A99, V, VO, VE, or V1-V30. It is also commonly
referred to as the "base floodplain" or "one-hundred-year floodplain."
For purposes of this section, the term "special flood hazard area
(SFHA)" is synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special
flood hazard."
BASE FLOOD  The flood having a one-percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT  That portion of a building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
BUILDING  See "structure."
CELLAR  Has the same meaning as "basement."
CRAWL SPACE  An enclosed area beneath the lowest elevated floor,
18 inches or more in height, which is used to service the underside
of the lowest elevated floor. The elevation of the floor of this enclosed
area, which may be of soil, gravel, concrete or other material, must
be equal to or above the lowest adjacent exterior grade. The enclosed
crawl space area shall be properly vented to allow for the equalization
of hydrostatic forces which would be experienced during periods of
flooding.
DEVELOPMENT  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved
real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures,
mining, dredging, filling, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
ELEVATED BUILDING  A nonbasement building (i) built, in the case
of a building in Zone A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, or D, to
have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in Zones
V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure
member of the elevated floor, elevated above the ground level by means
of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the
§ 405-26 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-26
401:996
flow of the water and (ii) adequately anchored so as not to impair the
structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude
of the base flood. In the case of Zone A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C,
X, or D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means
of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of Zone
V1-V30, VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise
meeting the definition of "elevated building," even though the lower
area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls that meet the federal
standards.
FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY  The federal
agency that administers the National Flood Insurance Program.
FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM)  An official map
of the community published by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency as part of a riverine community's Flood Insurance Study. The
FBFM delineates a regulatory floodway along watercourses studied in
detail in the Flood Insurance Study.
FLOOD ELEVATION STUDY  An examination, evaluation and
determination of the flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding
water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and
determination of flood-related erosion hazards.
FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM)  An official map of a
community, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
where the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard have been
designated as Zone A but no flood elevations are provided.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM)  An official map of a
community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has
delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk-premium
zones applicable to the community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY  See "flood elevation study."

E. General provisions.
§ 405-26 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-26
401:1000
(1) Lands to which this section applies. This section shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Kingston, Ulster County.
(2) Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.
(a) The areas of special flood hazard for the City of Kingston,
Community Number 360858, are identified and defined on the
following documents prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency:
[1] Flood Insurance Rate Map Panel Numbers 36111C0460E,
36111C0470E, 36111C0480E, 36111C0490E whose
effective date is September 25, 2009, and any subsequent
revisions to these map panels that do not affect areas
under our community's jurisdiction.
[2] A scientific and engineering report entitled "Flood
Insurance Study, Ulster County, New York, All
Jurisdictions," dated September 25, 2009.
(b) The above documents are hereby adopted and declared to be a
part of this section. The Flood Insurance Study and maps are
on file at the Office of the City Engineer, City Hall, 420
Broadway, Kingston, New York 12401.
(3) Interpretation and conflict with other laws.
(a) This section includes all revisions to the National Flood
Insurance Program through October 27, 1997, and shall
supersede all previous laws adopted for the purpose of flood
damage prevention.
(b) In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
section shall be held to be minimum requirements, adopted for
the promotion of the public health, safety, and welfare.
Whenever the requirements of this section are at variance with
the requirements of any other lawfully adopted rules,
regulations, ordinances, or local laws, the most restrictive, or
that imposing the higher standards, shall govern.
(4) Severability. The invalidity of any section or provision of this
section shall not invalidate any other section or provision thereof.
(5) Penalties for noncompliance. No structure in an area of special
flood hazard shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered and no land shall be excavated or filled
without full compliance with the terms of this section and any other
applicable regulations. Any infraction of the provisions of this
section by failure to comply with any of its requirements, including
infractions of conditions and safeguards established in connection
with conditions of the permit, shall constitute a violation. Any
§ 405-26 (RESERVED) § 405-26
401:1001
person who violates this section or fails to comply with any of
its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined no more
than $250 or imprisoned for not more than 15 days, or both.
Each day of noncompliance shall be considered a separate offense.
Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Kingston from
taking such other lawful action as necessary to prevent or remedy
an infraction. Any structure found not compliant with the
requirements of this section for which the developer and/or owner
has not applied for and received an approved variance under
Subsection H will be declared noncompliant and notification will be
sent to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(6) Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations.
Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights
may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This section does
not imply that land outside the area of special flood hazards or uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This section shall not create liability on the part of the
City of Kingston, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this section or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.
F. Administration.
(1) Designation of the local administrator. The Fire Chief or his
designee is hereby appointed local administrator to administer and
implement this section by granting or denying floodplain
development permits in accordance with its provisions. [Amended
3-5-2019 by L.L. No. 1-2019, approved 3-19-2019]
(2) The floodplain development permit.
(a) Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby
established for all construction and other development to be
undertaken in areas of special flood hazard in this community
for the purpose of protecting its citizens from increased flood
hazards and insuring that new development is constructed in a
manner that minimizes its exposure to flooding. It shall be
unlawful to undertake any development in an area of special
flood hazard, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
enumerated in Subsection E(2), without a valid floodplain
development permit. Application for a permit shall be made on
forms furnished by the local administrator and may include,
but not be limited to, plans, in duplicate, drawn to scale and
showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the
area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage
of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the
foregoing.

(b) Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall
be accompanied by an application fee to be established from
time to time by resolution of the Common Council. In addition,
the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing the City of
Kingston for any additional costs necessary for review,
inspection and approval of this project. The local administrator
may require a deposit of no more than $500 to cover these
additional costs.
(3) Application for a permit. The applicant shall provide the following
information as appropriate. Additional information may be required
on the permit application form.
(a) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the
lowest floor (including basement or cellar) of any new or
substantially improved structure to be located in Zone A1-A30,
AE or AH, or Zone A if base flood elevation data are available.
Upon completion of the lowest floor, the permittee shall submit
to the local administrator the as-built elevation, certified by a
licensed professional engineer or surveyor.
(b) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which
any new or substantially improved nonresidential structure
will be floodproofed. Upon completion of the floodproofed
portion of the structure, the permittee shall submit to the local
administrator the as-built floodproofed elevation, certified by a
professional engineer or surveyor.
(c) A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect
that any utility floodproofing will meet the criteria in
Subsection G(2)(c), Utilities.

(f) A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, if
required by the local administrator, which shows whether
proposed development to be located in an area of special flood
hazard may result in physical damage to any other property.
(g) In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available from
other sources, base flood elevation data shall be provided by
the permit applicant for subdivision proposals and other
proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured
home and recreational vehicle parks and subdivisions) that are
greater than either 50 lots or five acres.
(4) Duties and responsibilities of the local administrator. Duties of the
Local Administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the
following:
(a) Permit application review. The local administrator shall
conduct the following permit application review before issuing
a floodplain development permit:
[1] Review all applications for completeness, particularly with
the requirements of Subsection F(3), Application for a
permit, and for compliance with the provisions and
standards of this section.
[2] Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks, to determine
whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe
from flooding. If a proposed building site is located in an
area of special flood hazard, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall meet the applicable
standards of Subsection G, Construction standards, and, in
particular, Subsection G(1)(a), Subdivision proposals.
[3] Determine whether any proposed development in an area
of special flood hazard may result in physical damage to
any other property (e.g., stream bank erosion and
increased flood velocities). The local administrator may
require the applicant to submit additional technical
analyses and data necessary to complete the
determination. If the proposed development may result in
physical damage to any other property or fails to meet the
requirements of Subsection G, Construction standards, no
permit shall be issued. The applicant may revise the
application to include measures that mitigate or eliminate
the adverse effects and resubmit the application.
[4] Determine that all necessary permits have been received
from those governmental agencies from which approval is
required by state or federal law.
(b) Use of other flood data.
§ 405-26 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-26

[1] When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has
designated areas of special flood hazard on the
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) but has
neither produced water surface elevation data (these
areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM) nor
identified a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain,
review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and
floodway data available from a federal, state or other
source, including data developed pursuant to Subsection
F(3)(g), as criteria for requiring that new construction,
substantial improvements or other proposed development
meet the requirements of this section.
[2] When base flood elevation data are not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish
flood elevations within the areas of special flood hazard,
for the purposes of this section.
(c) Alteration of watercourses. The local administrator shall:
[1] Notify adjacent communities and the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation prior to
permitting any alteration or relocation of a watercourse,
and submittal of evidence of such notification to the
Regional Director, Region II, Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
[2] Determine that the permit holder has provided for
maintenance within the altered or relocated portion of said
watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not
diminished.
(d) Construction stage.
[1] In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, upon placement of the lowest
floor or completion of floodproofing of a new or
substantially improved structure, the local administrator
shall obtain from the permit holder a certification of the
as-built elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed
elevation, in relation to mean sea level. The certificate
shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
licensed land surveyor or professional engineer and
certified by same. For manufactured homes, the permit
holder shall submit the certificate of elevation upon
placement of the structure on the site. A certificate of
elevation must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle
if it remains on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer
(unless it is fully licensed and ready for highway use).

401:1005
[2] Any further work undertaken prior to submission and
approval of the certification shall be at the permit holder's
risk. The local administrator shall review all data
submitted. Deficiencies detected shall be cause to issue a
stop-work order for the project unless immediately
corrected.
(e) Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's
engineer or architect shall make periodic inspections at
appropriate times throughout the period of construction in
order to monitor compliance with permit conditions and enable
said inspector to certify, if requested, that the development is
in compliance with the requirements of the floodplain
development permit and/or any variance provisions.
(f) Stop-work orders.
[1] The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a
stop-work order for any floodplain development found
ongoing without a development permit. Disregard of a
stop-work order shall subject the violator to the penalties
described in Subsection E(5) of this section.
[2] The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a
stop-work order for any floodplain development found
noncompliant with the provisions of this section and/or the
conditions of the development permit. Disregard of a stopwork
order shall subject the violator to the penalties
described in Subsection E(5) of this section.
(g) Certificate of compliance.
[1] In areas of special flood hazard, as determined by
documents enumerated in Subsection E(2), it shall be
unlawful to occupy or to permit the use or occupancy of
any building or premises, or both, or part thereof hereafter
created, erected, changed, converted or wholly or partly
altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate
of compliance has been issued by the local administrator
stating that the building or land conforms to the
requirements of this section.
[2] A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the local
administrator upon satisfactory completion of all
development in areas of special flood hazard.
[3] Issuance of the certificate shall be based upon the
inspections conducted as prescribed in Subsection F(4)(e),
Inspections, and/or any certified elevations, hydraulic
data, floodproofing, anchoring requirements or
encroachment analyses which may have been required as
a condition of the approved permit.

pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules.
(d) In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of
Appeals, shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant
factors, standards specified in other sections of this section
and:
[1] The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands
to the injury of others;
§ 405-26 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-26
401:1012
[2] The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
[3] The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the
individual owner;
[4] The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
[5] The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
[6] The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
[7] The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
[8] The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program of that area;
[9] The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
[10] The costs to local governments and the dangers associated
with conducting search and rescue operations during
periods of flooding;
[11] The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of
wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
[12] The costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including search and rescue
operations, maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems
and streets and bridges.
(e) Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection H(1)(d) and
the purposes of this section, the Zoning Board of Appeals may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of this section.
(f) The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions, including technical information, and report any
variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon
request.
(2) Conditions for variances.
(a) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or
less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
§ 405-26 (RESERVED) § 405-26
401:1013
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing
Items [1] through [12] in Subsection H(1)(d) have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre,
the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
(b) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon determination that:
[1] The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure;
and
[2] The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
(c) Variances may be issued by a community for new construction
and substantial improvements and for other development
necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use,
provided that:
[1] The criteria of Subsection H(2)(a), (d), (e) and (f) are met;
and
[2] The structure or other development is protected by
methods that minimize flood damages during the base
flood and create no additional threat to public safety.
(d) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge
would result.
(e) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood
hazard, to afford relief.
(f) Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written
justification of:
[1] A showing of good and sufficient cause;
[2] A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
[3] A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(g) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with
the lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given
written notice over the signature of a community official that:

§ 405-27. Waterfront Design Overlay District. [Amended 7-7-1992;
approved 7-8-1992]
The Waterfront Design Overlay District and underlying zoning shall be
eliminated and replaced with the RF-R Rondout Creek District and RF-H
Hudson Riverfront District in accordance with the attached map216 outlining
the same.217
§ 405-27.1. Mixed Use Overlay District. [Added 1-4-2005, approved
1-5-2005]
(1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below
the base flood level will result in increased premium rates
for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of
insurance coverage; and (2) such construction below the base
flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification
shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as
required in Subsection F(4)(h) of this section.
A. Purposes and principles.
(1) The Mixed Use Overlay Zoning Districts are intended to implement
a City of Kingston Comprehensive Plan Element for the areas
known as the "Stockade and Midtown Mixed Use Overlay Zoning
Districts." (See attached maps.218)
(2) According to the Comprehensive Plan Element, the creation of the
Mixed Use Overlay Zoning District has two underlying purposes.
(a) The first purpose is to adaptively reuse existing commercial
and industrial buildings to provide rental multifamily housing,
including affordable housing, to the present and future
residents of the City of Kingston.
(b) The second purpose is to encourage mixed-use, mixed-income,
pedestrian-based neighborhoods.
B. Proposals within the Mixed Use Overlay Zoning Districts are intended
to be based on the following guidelines:
(1) Affordable housing.
216. Editor's Note: The map is on file in the office of the City Clerk. For provisions regarding
the RF-R and RF-H Districts, see §§ 405-25 and 405-31.
217. Editor's Note: Former § 405-25, LS Landmark Overlay-Stockade District, was repealed
11-14-1989, approved 11-15-1989. For current provisions, see Ch. 264, Art. I, Historic and
Architectural Design Districts, and Art. IX of this chapter; former § 405-26, Landmark and

§ 405-26 (RESERVED) § 405-27.1
401:1015
(a) Guidelines to provide affordable housing pertains to individual
proposals to adaptively reuse commercial and industrial
buildings for five or more residential units.
(b) Of the five or more overall housing units created by individual
proposals to adaptively reuse commercial and industrial
buildings for residential purposes, 20% of those units will be
dedicated for affordable housing.
(c) The rental of affordable housing units will be calculated as not
exceed 30% of a household's income.
(d) The maximum income for a household to occupy an affordable
housing unit will be 80% of the Ulster County median income,
with adjustments for family size and be updated yearly.
(e) Affordable housing units should be dispersed throughout the
proposed housing project and be indistinguishable from
market rate units.
(f) Affordable housing units are phased in during the overall
construction process.
(g) Affordable housing units should remain affordable for the
length of time the building in question contains residential
units or remains residential.
(h) Final choice of the tenants to occupy the affordable housing
units lies with the owners of the adaptively reused commercial
and industrial buildings or their representatives. Owners of the
adaptively reused commercial and industrial buildings or their
representatives can choose a potential tenant from a pool of
income eligible tenants as kept by the Kingston Office of
Community Development and/or the Kingston Housing
Authority. In the case that the owners of the adaptively reused
commercial and industrial buildings or their representatives
identify a potential tenant to occupy an affordable housing
unit, apart from the pool kept by the Kingston Office of
Community Development and/or the Kingston Housing
Authority, that potential tenant must be judged income eligible
by the Kingston Office of Community Development or the
Kingston Housing Authority before he or she occupies the
affordable housing unit.
(i) The Kingston Office of Community Development will be
responsible for ensuring the long-term affordability of the
residential units within the Mixed Use Overlay Zoning
Districts. This includes ensuring that 20% of the units within
the appropriate adaptively reused commercial and industrial
buildings are dedicated to affordable housing.
(2) Mixed-use, mixed-income, pedestrian--based neighborhoods.
§ 405-27.1 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-27.1
401:1016
(a) The adaptive reuse of buildings should encourage residential
uses above retail or commercial uses.
(b) The safety, comfort and interest of pedestrians should be
integrated into the adaptive reuse site plans.
C. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNIT  A dwelling unit available at a cost of
no more than 30% of the gross household income of households at or
below 80% of the Ulster County Medium Income.
QUALIFIED AFFORDABLE HOUSING TENANT  An individual or
family with household incomes that do not exceed 80% of the medium
income with adjustments for household size.
D. The following uses are subject to the issuance of a special permit by the
Planning Board in accordance with the provisions of § 405-32 of this
chapter:
(1) The conversion of existing commercial or industrial buildings, or
sections of them, into residential apartments and went/live spaces
of which some will be dedicated as affordable housing. Such uses
will be subjected to § 405-30, Site development plan approval.
(2) Site and building enhancements that promote a mixed-use, mixedincome,
pedestrian-based neighborhood. Such uses will be
subjected to § 405-30, Site development plan approval.
E. Provision of affordable units. The Planning Board shall deny any permit
for development under this zoning chapter if the applicant for special
permit approval does not comply, at a minimum, with following
requirements for affordable units:
(1) At least 20% of the residential units in the adaptive reuse of
commercial or industrial buildings, of five or more units, shall be
established as affordable housing units for rental to qualified
affordable housing tenants.
F. Provisions applicable to affordable housing.

§ 405-27.2. TNDOD Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay
District. [Added 8-4-2009 by L.L. No. 9-2009, approved 8-13-2009]
In the TNDOD Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay District, the
following regulations will apply.
G. Development standards applicable to the adaptive reuse of commercial
and industrial buildings that promote a mixed-use, mixed-income,
pedestrian-based neighborhood. Intent: The safety, comfort and
interest of pedestrians relates to the extent to which buildings face
streets and public open spaces with entrances, windows and usable
outdoor space.
(1) Street level building spaces shall be limited to commercial
activities with residential spaces allowed at the second or above
floors.
(2) Primary entrances of buildings shall face a street or small park.
(3) Sheltering elements shall be included as part of the adaptive reuse
site plans.
(4) Shade trees shall be essential features of adaptive reuse site plans.
(5) Hunan-scale lighting shall be essential features of adaptive reuse
site plans.
(6) Small parks should be encouraged as part of the adaptive reuse site
plans.
(7) Reinforce pedestrian connections between building and street,
between buildings and through parking lots as part of the adaptive
reuse site plans.
(8) Minimize the dominance of parking, screen parking lots from the
street and make parking lots cooler as part of the adaptive reuse
site plans.
A. District intent and general purpose.
(1) The Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay District
(TNDOD) is hereby established to encourage and facilitate
redevelopment and adaptive reuse of the former "Tilcon Mining"
properties. These former industrial sites comprise approximately
345 acres of the site of 508 acres located along and adjacent to the
northern portion of the City's waterfront.
(2) These properties have been analyzed and considered as part of
various waterfront planning efforts conducted by the City,
including the City's Local Waterfront Revitalization Program
(LWRP) (1992) and the City's Waterfront Development
Implementation Plan (2000). In response to contemporaneous
development proposals, the City has also conducted more focused
§ 405-27.1 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-27.2
401:1018
planning analyses of these properties. This effort has included
application of the policies and principles contained in the
waterfront planning studies recited above to various specific
development scenarios and the conduct of detailed environmental
impact assessment of those development scenarios pursuant to the
requirements of the New York State Environmental Quality Review
(SEQR) Act.
(3) The result of these collective planning efforts is the City's desire to
create the opportunity for traditional neighborhood development at
these locations that is consistent with the character and history of
the City. Development of traditional neighborhoods along the
riverfront will respect its natural resources and provide attractive,
diverse, walkable and culturally vibrant communities with strong
linkages to the rest of the City of Kingston. The City finds that
proceeding in this manner constitutes good planning, is consistent
with the City's approved LWRP, New York State coastal zone
policies and the Vision Statement in the City's Waterfront
Implementation Plan and furthers the public health, safety and
welfare of existing and future residents of the City.
(4) The TNDOD is intended to provide an option to development under
provisions of the existing underlying zoning districts. The
standards and procedures set forth for the TNDOD in this section
are intended to override and replace standards and procedures set
forth elsewhere in this chapter unless such standards and
procedures are specifically referenced or incorporated herein.
B. Specific purposes. The TNDOD is intended to serve the following
specific purposes and further the policies of the City's LWRP:
(1) Encourage innovative, traditional neighborhood development
which consists of compact, mixed-use neighborhoods where
residential, commercial and civic buildings are within close
proximity to each other and incorporates the principles set forth in
Subsection G(6) below.
(2) Create pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods for a diverse population
to live, work, learn and play.
(3) Provide for the reclamation, redevelopment and/or adaptive reuse
of former industrial sites (Policies 1 and 1A).
(4) Strengthen Kingston's economic base.
(5) Facilitate and enhance meaningful public access to the City's
Hudson River waterfront lands.
(6) Promote the preservation of large natural features such as
woodlands and wetlands and creation of public open spaces within
individual neighborhoods.
§ 405-27.2 (RESERVED) § 405-27.2
401:1019
(7) Preserve and protect significant views to and from development
sites.
(8) Encourage the incorporation of historic and civic elements into
neighborhood design and build upon Kingston's historical and
architectural heritage.
(9) Encourage the provision and/or upgrade of necessary
infrastructure resources relating to sewer, water, drainage and
parking to facilitate development and improve the natural
environment.
(10) Provide housing opportunities for moderate-income families and
individuals, including municipal employees, first-time homeowners
and senior citizens.
C. Applicability. This district applies to that portion of the City of Kingston
waterfront and adjoining upland areas consisting of approximately 345
acres of the site of 508 acres comprising the former Tilcon Mining
properties. The precise district boundaries are designated on the
official City of Kingston Zoning Map.

§ 405-30 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-30
401:1034
(6) The Planning Board may hold a public hearing on the site plan if it
determines that the matter is of wide public interest. If such a
hearing is held, it shall be held within 62 days of the official
submission date of the application, and notice shall be given at
least five days prior to the date of such hearing by publication in
the official City newspaper. [Amended 12-16-1999 by L.L. No.

(7) The Planning Board shall act to approve or disapprove with
conditions any such site plan within 62 days after the public
hearing or, if no hearing is held, within 62 days of the official
submission date. The time within which the Planning Board must
render its decision may be extended by mutual consent of the
applicant and the board. Conditional approval by the Planning
Board shall include written findings upon any site plan element
found contrary to the provision or intent of this chapter. In
reviewing the application, the Planning Board shall consider
whether a proposed plan will conform to the intent and
requirements of this chapter and/or what revisions are appropriate.
In reviewing site plans, the Planning Board shall comply with the
provisions of the State Environmental Quality Review Act. The
decision of the Planning Board shall be filed in the office of the City

1-3-2000]
(8) Amendments to a previously approved site plan shall be acted upon
in the same manner as the original site plan.
(9) Following approval of the site plan by the Planning Board, the
applicant shall file with the City Clerk a performance bond to cover
the full cost of any required improvements in an amount set by the
Planning Board upon advice of the City Engineer. If the value of
improvements is less than $25,000, unless the Planning Board
determines that improvements of lesser costs are important to the
health and welfare of the City or the immediate area, the Planning
Board may waive the bonding requirements. Said bond shall be in a
form satisfactory to the Corporation Counsel of the City of Kingston
and may be in cash or in the form of surety company bonds and, if a
surety company bond, shall be in the amount of 100% of the
estimated cost or, if a cash bond, 50% of the estimated cost, as
certified by the City Engineer, of proposed screening and
landscaping, including planting and maintenance thereof for a
minimum of one year and a maximum of three years at the
discretion of the Planning Board, stormwater drainage systems,
public and private streets and drives, water and sanitary sewer
systems, outdoor lighting and off-street parking areas, loading

bond shall be conditioned upon the property owner's or developer's
completing said work enumerated herein and set forth on the
approved site plan in a manner satisfactory to the City Engineer
of the City of Kingston and upon the proper functioning of said
systems for a period of one year from their completion. In default
thereof, said bond or deposit shall be forfeited, and the City shall
use the amount thereof to complete any incomplete portion of
said work or to make repairs as are necessary to assure proper
functioning of said improvements; provided, however, if any
amount of money remains after the City has completed said work,
such excess money will be returned to the surety or the person
putting up the required deposit. Said surety bond or cash deposit
may be reduced by resolution of the Planning Board upon the
certification of the City Engineer that one or more particular items
required by the Planning Board have been satisfactorily completed.
If a fifty-percent cash bond has been posted, such reduction shall
be in the ratio that the completed item or items bear to the total
estimated costs of the required improvements. The installation
of all improvements shall be under the direct supervision of a
registered architect or professional engineer.
E. Time limit on validity of approval. Approval of a site plan by the
Planning Board shall be valid for a period of 120 days from the date
thereof for the purpose of obtaining a building permit. Failure to secure
a building permit during this period shall cause the site plan approval to
become null and void. Upon application, the Planning Board may extend
the time limit on the validity of the approval to not more than two years
from the date of the original approval.
F. Required submissions. All maps submitted must be at a scale of not less
than 30 feet to the inch. Where the site is within an L Landmark Overlay

the Planning Board concerning review of a site plan may bring a
proceeding to review in a manner provided by Article 78 of the Civil
Practice Law and Rules in a court of record on the ground that such
decision is illegal, in whole or in part.
A. Purpose. It is recognized that the waterfront encompasses a unique
resource within the City of Kingston, containing both a significant
opportunity for the achievement of public amenities and a major
potential for water related development. To provide an incentive which
will further encourage the most appropriate use and development of
the City's waterfront in a manner designed to achieve adopted planning
objectives and to further the policies and purposes of the Kingston
Local Waterfront Revitalization Program, the City of Kingston may
allow, only by application for a special permit and following a public
hearing held on notice duly given in the same manner as required by
law for zoning amendments, an increased floor to area ratio and/or
building height, as set forth below. The public hearing shall be held by
the City of Kingston. An advisory report from the Planning Board shall
be provided to the City Council for its consideration, in the acceptance
or rejection of any application per this section. City Council approval
shall be in a form acceptable to the Corporation Counsel of the City of
Kingston.

§ 405-31 (RESERVED) § 405-31
401:1041
estimate of the cost of providing the proposed features and the
value of the density increase requested. The Planning Board
may also engage its own independent experts to either
separately prepare such analysis or to review those prepared
by the applicant. The reasonable cost of such expert assistance
shall be reimbursed to the City by the applicant.
(h) No incentive density increase shall be granted for the
construction of any improvement which would otherwise be

E. Siting and facility related guidelines. The following guidelines shall be
required of all development actions within the RF-R and RF-H Zoning
Districts. The Planning Board shall specifically incorporate the
following guidelines in its review of proposed development activity:
(1) Developments such as roadways, all utility powerlines and
incompatible signs shall be prohibited from shorelines in order to
maintain the attractive quality of the shoreline and to retain views
to and from the shoreline.
(2) Structures should be clustered or oriented so as to retain the
quality and extent of views from the adjacent public streets through
the property to the Hudson River and Rondout Creek as well as the
quality of views of the development from the water, save open
space, and provide visual organization to a development.
(3) Sound existing structures (especially historic buildings) shall be
incorporated into the overall development scheme whenever
possible.
(4) Appropriate architectural scales, forms and materials shall be
utilized to ensure that buildings and structures are compatible with
and add interest to the landscape. More specifically, the design of
all structures is to be compatible with that of the surrounding
structures and neighborhoods. Compatibility shall be determined
by a review of proposed use of materials, scale, mass, height, color,
texture and location of the structures on the site.
(5) All outdoor lighting is to be of such a nature and so arranged as to
preclude the diffusion of glare onto adjoining properties, streets
and the waterfront.
(6) All development proposed within the RF-H Hudson Riverfront
District shall provide a scenic landscape protection buffer. While it
is recognized that Kingston's Hudson River waterfront includes
abandoned industrial sites as well as natural areas, it is the
purpose of this scenic landscape protection buffer to protect and
enhance, to the maximum extent possible, the scenic qualities of
the Hudson River Local Waterfront Revitalization Program area by
maintaining, creating and continuing the vegetative corridor of the
Mid-Hudson River region. All non-water-dependent development
proposed within the RF-H Hudson Riverfront District shall provide,
at a minimum, a fifty-foot scenic landscape protection buffer. The
scenic landscape protection buffer may incorporate the permanent
public access that is identified in other parts of the RF-H Zoning
District regulations. The following specific provisions shall apply to
all uses within the RF-H Hudson Riverfront District:
§ 405-31 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-31
401:1044
(a) Proposed development shall avoid excessive or unnecessary
grading, indiscriminate earth moving or clearing of property
and removal of trees and vegetation which would disfigure
natural land forms.
(b) If the scenic landscape protection buffer area already has
mature trees, the preservation of such trees is required. If
predevelopment buffer vegetation is insufficient, additional
trees and shrubs with a variety of species appropriate for the
local climate and environment shall be required. While
complete vegetative screening is not required, sufficient plant
material shall be provided to protect, enhance and continue
the vegetative corridor of the Mid-Hudson River region.
(c) Within the scenic landscape protection buffer there shall be no
development, clearing, grading or construction activity with
the following exceptions:
[1] Minimum land area necessary for provision of waterfront
access roadway easements, water, sanitary sewer, storm
drainage, electrical, telephone, natural gas, cable, etc.,
service lines, provided that they run approximately
perpendicular to the waterfront. Permission for easement
and right-of-way disturbance and clearing for such
services shall be more favorably considered when such
activity is consolidated with vehicular access routes.
[2] Pedestrian trails, boardwalks, bicycle paths, etc., designed
to fulfill the requirements of permanent public access as
defined in other parts of the RF-H Zoning District
regulations.
[3] Lighting fixtures if, for safety reasons, cannot be placed
outside the buffer area and only when electric utility lines
serving these fixtures are underground or are otherwise
out of sight and the necessary easements can be
established and constructed without reducing the
screening and visual softening capacity of the vegetative
buffer.
[4] The addition of planting, earth forms or other visual
buffers which, in the opinion of the Kingston Planning
Board, would better achieve the purposes set out in these
siting and facility related guidelines for protection of
scenic and visual resources.
(d) Visual Landscape Buffer Plan.
[1] As part of all site development plan submittals under
§ 405-30 of the Kingston Zoning Regulations, the applicant
shall prepare and submit a comprehensive Visual
Landscape Buffer Plan. Such plan shall include, at a
§ 405-31 (RESERVED) § 405-31
401:1045
minimum, information about existing and proposed
vegetation, color of structures and landscaping proposed
in order to protect, enhance and continue the vegetative
corridor of the Mid-Hudson River region. Building color
and landscaping shall be an integral part of the plan. The
plan shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
[a] The name and address of the applicant and owner, if
not the same.
[b] A detailed narrative description, with accompanying
maps, sketches, photographs, simulations, etc., of how
the proposed development will provide a scenic buffer
and blend into the landscape along the waterfront.
Such information shall include a description of
existing and proposed vegetation, proposed color of
buildings and proposed landscaping.
[c] An attached sketch or plan of the area on a scale of not
less than one inch equals 60 feet, clearly labeled
"Visual Landscape Buffer Plan."
[d] The condition of the existing trees and vegetation with
respect to disease and potential for creating
hazardous conditions.
[e] Location, size and species of trees to be preserved.
[f] Location, size and species of any trees proposed to be
removed.
[g] Location, size and species of proposed trees and other
vegetation to be planted.
[h] Topographic contours at two-foot intervals in the
United States Coast and Geodetic Survey datum of
mean sea level.
[i] A detailed horticultural, vegetative and administrative
management plan for ongoing maintenance of all
aspects and components of the scenic landscape
protection buffer.
[2] The plan shall address the functional aspects of
landscaping such as drainage, erosion prevention, wind
barriers, provisions for shade, energy conservation, sound
absorption, dust abatement and reduction of glare.
(e) Plant material shall be selected for interest in its structure,
texture and color and for its ultimate growth. Plants that are
indigenous to the area and others that will be hardy,
harmonious to the design and of attractive appearance shall be
used.
§ 405-31 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-31
401:1046
§ 405-31.1. RF-R District development standards. [Added 2-1-2005,
approved 2-2-2005]
(f) If any new plant material, planted as a result of development
with the scenic landscape protection buffer, dies after planting,
it shall be replaced with healthy plants.
[1] The applicant shall file with the governing agency a
performance bond to cover the full cost of any required
replacement plants, in an amount set by the governing
agency.
[2] Said bond shall be in a form satisfactory to the Corporation
Counsel of the City of Kingston and may be in cash or in
the form of a surety company bond in the amount of 100%
of the estimated cost of replacement of the plantings. In
default of the herein above provision, said bond or deposit
shall be forfeited and the City shall use the amount thereof
to complete any incomplete portion of said work.
(7) Proposed structures shall be in scale and harmonious with
permanent neighboring developments.
(8) All development within the RF-H Hudson Riverfront District shall
incorporate in addition to vegetation, other means to protect and
enhance the scenic landscape of the Mid-Hudson River region,
such as building color. The use of building color should allow
proposed buildings to blend into the background of the landscape
as much as possible.
(9) Parking areas shall be treated with such things as building wall
extensions, segmented parking areas with elevation differences,
plantings, berms or other means so as to minimize the impact of
parked vehicles on the view from the Hudson River and from public
ways and adjacent land uses.
(10) Project features which may have negative impacts upon adjacent
properties, such as parking lots, service entrances, loading zones,
mechanical equipment, etc., shall be visually buffered from the
adjacent properties.
(11) Monotony of design in single and multiple building projects shall be
avoided. Variation of detail, form and siting shall be used to provide
visual interest. In multiple building projects, variable siting of
individual buildings may be used to prevent a monotonous
appearance.
A. General.
(1) Purpose. In keeping with the Local Waterfront Revitalization Plan
developed by the City, these standards were created to protect the
existing historical development along the Rondout Creek
§ 405-31 (RESERVED) § 405-31.1
401:1047
waterfront, and promote new development which enhances the
visual appearance of the City. It is intended to act as a tool for
developers and planners to help streamline the design approval
process by specifying the desired development characteristics
upfront during the design process.
(2) This section applies to all new development and redevelopment
within the RF-R Rondout Creek District. In the event of a conflict
between this section and other portions of the Zoning Code, the
Zoning Enforcement Officer (ZEO) will determine which
requirement governs. Improvements under these standards are
subject to applicable Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility
Guidelines (ADAAG).
(3) Incentives, New development and redevelopment within the RF-R
District may qualify for incentives as outlined in § 405-31.
(4) All proposed work within the RF-R District must make reasonable
attempts to preserve, protect and incorporate existing topography
and meaningful vegetation into any proposed development plans.
(5) All proposed work within the RF-R District must preserve, protect
and incorporate the exterior facades of existing historic structures
into any proposed development plans. "Historic structures" are
defined in this section as any construction which is listed on, or is
eligible to be listed on, the National Historic Register.
(6) All proposed work within the RF-R District must preserve, protect
and incorporate the original forms and shapes of existing roofs on
historic structures into any proposed development plans.
(7) Waivers.
(a) The Planning Board is hereby empowered and authorized to
waiver or vary any design standards or requirements in this
section for new development within the RF-R Rondout Creek
District by a majority plus one vote. Any such waiver may be
exercised in the event of the following:
[1] The nonconforming elements meet the spirit and intent of
the design goals contained herein as defined by the
Planning Board; and
[2] The specific standards or requirements are not
appropriate to a particular development or project.
(b) The Planning Board shall also have the authority to impose
reasonable and appropriate conditions on the grant of any
waiver to protect the district.
(8) In addition to the site plan review requirements in § 405-30, new
site development plans in the RF-R District are required to submit
the following:
§ 405-31.1 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-31.1
401:1048
(a) Site plan which specifies all proposed demolition and
construction work and includes:
[1] The location, diameter and species of all existing trees on
the property which have a caliper of eight inches or more.
These trees should be preserved as much as reasonably
possible and incorporated into any site development
designs. Existing vegetation clusters, such as bushes and
large shrubs, should also be preserved as much as
reasonably possible, especially along the waterfront, and
indicated on design drawings.
[2] Existing structures and pedestrian paths on adjacent
properties that are within 50 feet of all property lines.
(b) Building elevations, at minimum scale of 1/8 inch equals one
foot, of all facades, which specifies all proposed demolition and
construction work and includes:
[1] Exterior materials, changes or transitions in materials,
surface lighting, surface signs, street number, awnings
and similar facade accessories.
[2] Proposed alterations or changes to existing facades, if any.
[3] Partial elevation of any existing street facades within 100
feet of the proposed building, shown to scale, alongside
the proposed street facade.
(c) Samples of proposed facade, roofing and sign materials.
(d) Site plan indicating exterior lighting photo metrics, spread and
intensity.
(e) Perspective color renderings illustrating what the proposal
would look like if viewed from the street and from the Rondout
Creek (if located on waterfront property).
(f) Photographs of the site and surrounding area that includes all
existing elements required to be shown on the site plans.
B. Site planning and landscaping standards.
(1) All new development with water frontage along the Rondout Creek
must comply with the clustered development pattern as follows:
(a) New construction must locate the front facade of the building
at, or as close as possible to, the front setback line. Alternately,
the Planning Board may require that the front facade align
with the facade of an existing building on an adjacent property.
This front facade must be placed at the front setback line, with
the primary entry facing the street. (1 in Figure 1219).
§ 405-31.1 (RESERVED) § 405-31.1
401:1049
(b) New construction must locate a side facade of the building at,
or as close as possible to, a side setback line. If there is an
existing building nearby on an adjacent property, the new
construction should be located nearest that side. The intent of
this provision is to cluster buildings together in groups, while
leaving open, undeveloped areas clustered in groups as well to
preserve open space and public views of the creek. (2 in Figure
1).
(c) The overall width of the proposed building or buildings on the
lot must not exceed 60% of the total width of the front setback
line. (3 in Figure 1).
(d) Development proposals which are merged from multiple
properties, or consist of multiple buildings, must cluster the
structures together to form areas of denser development. (4 in
Figure 1).
(e) Development along the waterfront must attempt to work in
conjunction with other buildings on the site and adjacent
properties to create public plazas or similar exterior spaces. (5
in Figure 1).220
(2) All new development with water frontage along the Rondout Creek
must provide a continuous pedestrian esplanade along the width of
the property adjacent to the waterway. This esplanade must link to
the esplanade(s) on adjacent properties, and must also be linked to
a public right-of-way by a waterfront access path. The pedestrian
esplanade and waterfront access paths should be open to public
access during the hours from dawn to 9:00 p.m. (6 in Figure 1).
(a) The waterfront access paths to and from the public street may
be provided through the ground floor interior of a building on
the site and be restricted during business closing hours.
(b) Waterfront access paths should be identified as a throughway
to and from the water with a City-approved sign and provide a
view of the water from street level (1 in Figures 2 and 3). See
Figure 19 for sign specifications.221
(c) Waterfront access paths should be differentiated from adjacent
outdoor areas such as patios or plazas with a visual or physical
separation of materials or plantings. They should be
maintained and kept clear of tables, displays and other
obstructions during public access hours. (2 in Figure 3).
(d) Waterfront access paths may be provided along a side property
line so that it is a shared access arrangement with the
219. Editor's Note: Figure 1 is included at the end of this chapter.
220. Editor's Note: Figure 1 is included at the end of this chapter.

§ 405-31.1 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-31.1
401:1050
neighboring property. Such paths would meet the waterfront
access requirements of both properties simultaneously.
Waterfront access paths located along the property line
between adjacent buildings are hereby referred to in this
section as "gateways." (3 in Figure 3).222
(e) Trees should be incorporated (existing) or added (new) along
waterfront access paths no less than once every 40 feet (4 in
Figure 3). City-approved tree grates should be used at new
tree locations when incorporated into paving (3 in Figure 4223).
(f) At least one public bench and trash receptacle should be
provided no less than every 200 feet along a waterfront access
path or pedestrian esplanade. (2 in Figure 2224).
(g) Waterfront access paths and pedestrian esplanades should be
illuminated with City-approved lamps at least once every 50
feet (3 in Figure 2). See § 405-31.1H for exterior lighting and
lamp requirements.
(h) These pedestrianways must meet all requirements of the
Americans with Disabilities Act, including the transitions from
one property to another.
(3) The primary building facade and public entry must always face the
street and be parallel to the front lot line. The building width along
the front facade should be maximized to increase front facade
exposure wherever possible (1 in Figure 4).
(4) New development must work together with adjacent properties to
coordinate shared parking, service and delivery areas, where
possible. Such areas would share a common curb-cut (1 in Figure
7225).
(5) Sidewalks must be provided along the full width of the property
adjoining a public street, and provide direct access to the primary
entry (2 in Figure 4).
(6) All off-street parking, loading dock and trash storage facilities must
be located at the side of the lot. No parking, loading dock or trash
storage facilities are permitted closer to the street than the front
facade of the building. No parking, loading dock or similar services
are permitted within 25 feet of the water on waterfront properties,
or 10 feet from the rear lot line on non-waterfront properties.
(a) Off-street parking, loading docks and trash storage facilities
must be screened from view from the public street, waterway

§ 405-31.1 (RESERVED) § 405-31.1
401:1051
and pedestrian access paths as directed by the Planning Board.
Screening must be accomplished with landscaping, existing
vegetation or other methods as approved by the Planning
Board. (2 in Figures 6 and 7226).
(b) Off-street parking requirements.
[1] The amount of off-street parking required for new
development is intentionally reduced in the RF-R Zone
waterfront properties to limit the visual impact of large
parking areas visible along the creek. This reduction
assumes that much of the parking will be accommodated
with on-street parking and in shared public lots in the
area. This requires fewer parking spaces to be provided on
the property for site plan approval. However, new site
development plans must illustrate that they have the area
to accommodate regular parking requirements as per
§ 405-34J should it later be determined that the original
number of spaces is insufficient. This reserve parking area
should be left undeveloped in its natural vegetative state,
or landscaped as green space (1 in Figure 6).
[2] Required number of off-street parking spaces in RF-R
District waterfront properties:
[a] Handicapped spaces: as required by law.
[b] All other spaces: twenty-five-percent reduction from
parking space ratios required in § 405-34J.
(c) In order to reduce the amount of parking lot along the
waterway, off-street parking areas required in the RF-R Zone
are intended to be temporary. If sufficient public parking is
made available in the future around the project area, the
Planning Board may later require that the off-street parking
area near the water be removed or reduced. Service and
delivery drives may remain, however.
(d) Off-street parking and similar paved areas must be designed in
regular, rectangular shapes which efficiently minimize the
amount of impervious surface area. Such impervious surface
area should be properly drained to eliminate water runoff
towards the creek.
(e) Off-street parking areas must be limited to individual areas of
no more than 20 spaces per grouping. Individual groups must
be separated by meaningful landscaped areas which include
trees and ground cover as directed by the Planning Board (4 in
Figure 7227).
226. Editor's Note: Figures 6 and 7 are included at the end of this chapter.
227. Editor's Note: Figure 7 is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 405-31.1 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-31.1
401:1052
(f) Off street parking on waterfront properties must be oriented
along a north-south axis (perpendicular to the creek) to limit
exposure along the waterway whenever possible (3 in Figures
6 and 7).
(7) Properties in the RF-R District are limited to one curb-cut access
per property, unless otherwise approved by the Planning Board.
Curb-cut and driveways widths must only be as wide as necessary
to accommodate the needed travel lanes. Curb-cut radiuses must
be no larger than five feet (1 in Figure 7).
(8) No development will be permitted beyond the water's edge except
as necessary for the creation of docks, marinas, boat ramps and
similar maritime function access.
(a) Habitable spaces, including sheds, marina offices or
enclosures permanently docked or constructed beyond the
water's edge for the purposes of commercial business are
prohibited.
(b) Marine vessels along the waterway of Rondout Creek intended
for commercial use, display or educational purposes, excluding
those with a valid City or state docking lease, are required to
obtain a special permit and may not dock or be moored for
more than 30 days in any six-month period unless otherwise
provided by the special permit. Consideration for issuance of
said permit shall include, but not be limited to, general
aesthetics, public health and safety, maintenance, etc.
(c) Elements permanently constructed beyond the water's edge
must not extend higher than 15 feet above mean high-tide
level.
(d) No lighting fixtures may be located beyond the water's edge
except those used for pedestrian safety and walkway
illumination. See § 405-31.1H for lighting standards.
(9) Installation or replacement of bulkhead will be designed by a
professional engineer and submitted to the Planning Board and
City Engineer for review and approval, and shall conform visually
in scale and height with nearby bulkhead. Where the promenade is
adjacent to the bulkhead, the bulkhead structure shall have a
twelve-inch-by-twelve-inch, wooden cap beam to match the design
in TR Gallo Park.
C. Height, scale and massing.
(1) New construction in the RF-R District must comply with the height,
scale and massing requirements illustrated in Figure 8228 for either
waterfront or non-waterfront properties.
228. Editor's Note: Figure 8 is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 405-31.1 (RESERVED) § 405-31.1
401:1053
(a) Minimum building height.
[1] Two-story minimum building height is required along the
front facade facing the street in both waterfront and nonwaterfront
properties. The majority of the building mass
should be placed at the front of the site to maximize front
facade exposure, however the building height may step
down to lower levels in the rear (1 in Figure 8). Corner lots
may place a majority of the building mass at the corner.
Maximum building height is 35 feet within 100 feet of the
creek, and 42 feet beyond 100 feet.
[2] The City may elect to waive the two-story height
requirement in some instances where it would obstruct
existing views of the creek.
(b) The second floors of new construction must provide habitable
space measuring at least 12 feet in depth measured back from
the front facade (2 in Figure 8). No false facades are permitted.
Maximum parapet height is four feet unless otherwise required
by state or federal codes.
(c) No portion of the facade may extend more than 40 feet in
length horizontally without a facade transition. A "facade
transition" is defined as a change in the entire plane of the
facade where it steps (forward or backward) at least 24 inches.
Such transitions should not occur more than once in a four-foot
span along the facade (3 in Figure 8).
(d) No portion of the roofline may extend more than 40 feet in
length horizontally without a roofline transition. A "roofline
transition" is defined as a change in the height of the roofline
where it steps (up or down) at least 24 inches. Such transitions
should not occur more than once in a four-foot span along the
facade (4 in Figure 8).
(e) Facade and roofline transitions should be used to highlight
important areas of the facade, such as a building entry (5 in
Figure 8).
(2) Small scale building materials similar to those recommended in
§ 405-31.1F(2) are required as the primary building material along
the front facade and waterfront facade of all new construction.
(3) Areas of blank wall larger than an eight-foot radius circle are not
permitted on the front or waterfront facades of new construction (6
in Figure 8229). Areas of blank wall larger than a sixteen-foot radius
circle are not permitted on the side facades of new construction.
"Blank wall" is defined as an area of facade which does not contain
229. Editor's Note: Figure 8 in included at the end of this chapter.
§ 405-31.1 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-31.1
401:1054
any decorative articulation of materials which measure at least two
inches in depth, or openings such as windows and doors.
D. Roofs.
(1) Mansard roofs, shed roofs, fake roof fronts, built-out roof frames
which are hung from the facade and similar applied designs are
prohibited as primary roof types.
(2) New construction with a flat roof is required to be capped by an
architectural cornice design that is a sculptural expression of the
primary facade material, wood or simulated wood design, at the top
of all facades. This articulated parapet or cornice design must be at
least 12 inches tall on one-story facades and at least 24 inches tall
on facades of two or more stories. Maximum parapet height is four
feet unless otherwise required by state or federal codes.
(3) New construction with a sloped roof must have a minimum roof
pitch of no less than 5:12 on primary roof areas (not including
dormers, entry canopies or similar secondary roof elements) or a
maximum pitch of 12:12.
(a) The tallest portion of the roof must be orientated to place at
least one gable-end facing the street.
(b) Roof overhangs at the eave and gable ends must be at least
eight inches deep.
(4) New roof construction must be designed so as to divert the fall of
rain and snow away from pedestrian areas such as walkways and
doors.
(5) Air-handling units, condensers, satellite dishes and other
equipment placed on the roof must be located and screened from
view so as not to be readily visible from the street or waterway. The
Planning Board may require that roof-mounted equipment be
visually minimized with painted colors and finish complementary to
the overall building design.
(6) See Materials List in Figure 14 for approved roof materials.230
E. Facade composition and fenestration.
(1) The front and waterfront facades of new commercial construction
must be organized in a base - middle - top configuration as
illustrated in Figure 10.231
(a) The base level consists of the most open and sculptural facade
expression at the first floor. The amount of door and window
230. Editor's Note: Figure 14 is included at the end of this chapter.
231. Editor's Note: Figure 10 is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 405-31.1 (RESERVED) § 405-31.1
401:1055
openings should equal between 75% to 90% of the facade in
this area (1 Figure 10).
[1] Individual window openings in the facade cannot exceed
12 feet in width, and must be separated from each other by
at least 18 inches of facade. Window glass area cannot
exceed five feet in width without being separated by at
least six inches of mullion.
[2] Window frames must be recessed at least five inches back
from the plane of the facade. The primary entry doorway to
the street must be recessed at least 12 inches back from
the plane of the facade, and should express the greatest
amount of facade articulation.
[3] The base should be capped by a cornice element or other
transition having a change in depth, materials and color
which differentiates it from the upper levels. The cornice
element should be designed to accommodate the desired
facade lettering or signs for the property. See § 405-31.1G,
Signs and sign lighting.
(b) The middle level consists of the upper floors, and has a lower
fenestration level than the first floor. The amount of window
openings should equal between 25% to 50% of the facade in
this area (2 in Figure 10).
[1] Individual window openings in the facade at this level
cannot exceed six feet in width, and must be separated
from each other by at least 24 inches of facade. Window
glass area at this level cannot exceed three feet in width
without being separated by at least four inches of mullion.
[2] Window frames must be recessed at least two inches back
from the plane of the facade.
(c) The top level consists of the roof or cornice of the building (3 in
Figure 10). See § 405-31.1D, Roofs.
(2) The front and waterfront facades of new commercial construction
must express structural elements and bay divisions on the exterior
facade with the use of pilasters, recessed archways and similar
relief. Such relief must measure at least two inches in depth. This
facade expression may be required by the Planning Board on side
facades which have blank wall areas as defined in § 405-31.1C(3).
(3) The front and waterfront facades of new construction with masonry
exteriors are required to visually express the structural lintels over
windows, doors, archways and similar openings (4 in Figure 10).
See Materials List in Figure 14 for a listing of approved lintel
materials.232
§ 405-31.1 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-31.1
401:1056
(a) The rhythm of facade elements across the front or waterfront
facade must be arranged in an easily recognizable pattern,
such as a repeating or symmetrical layout. Breaks or
fluctuations to the facade pattern should be reserved to
highlight areas of special interest, such as entry points to the
building. (1 in Figure 11233).
(b) New construction adjacent to or added to existing historic
structures should match the rhythm of facade elements of the
existing building (2 in Figure 11).
(4) The proportion of facade elements such as windows, window
divisions and bays must have a vertical orientation (taller than they
are wide) of at least x wide to 1 .75x tall. The proportions of
individual elements should be used consistently throughout the
design, such that all windows and their divisions are generally of
the same proportion (3 in Figure 11).
(a) New construction adjacent to or added to existing historic
structures should match or be compatible with the proportion
of facade elements of the existing building (4 in Figure 11).
(b) Horizontally proportioned elements (wider than they are tall)
must be used sparingly. Strong horizontal influences such as
overly bold fascias, strip windows or banding designs of brick
are prohibited.
(c) The proportion of structural facade elements, such as columns,
pilasters and posts, must be designed accordingly with the
weight they appear to be carrying (1 in Figure 12234).
F. Materials and colors.
(1) All proposed work within the RF-R District must present, protect
and maintain the use of existing exterior materials of historic
structures whenever possible. If replacement is necessary, replace
with like materials which have the same basic forms and
proportions.
(a) Existing exterior materials removed for demolition should be
salvaged for use in patching or as new exterior material in
additions whenever possible.
(b) Additions to existing historic structures must use exterior
materials which match the basic form, proportions and
material of the original building. Exact material matches for
color and texture are not required.

§ 405-31.1 (RESERVED) § 405-31.1
401:1057
(c) The covering or concealing of existing historic exterior
materials with new materials is prohibited. The Planning Board
may require that newer existing exterior materials be removed
to reveal historical surfaces underneath, if appropriate.
(2) Smaller scale materials are required on front and waterfront
facades of all new construction. See Materials List in Figure 14 for
recommended materials.235
(a) When using more than one material on the exterior facade, one
material must be used as the primary theme with others used
only sparingly to complement or accent the design. The use of
a varidy of design styles or materials across the facades of the
same building is prohibited.
(b) When making a transition from one material to the next, the
change must occur at hard-edge or depth transition in the
facade which creates a surface for one material to terminate
into before the next one begins, as illustrated in Figure 13.236
(c) Special designs or decorative patterns created in the exterior
materials are encouraged.
(3) All exterior colors must be of a natural, muted shade. Brighter,
more vibrant colors, if used, must be reserved for minor accents
and highlights only. All exterior colors, including paint, dyes,
awnings, signs and lights, must be approved by the Planning Board.
(a) When using more than one color on the exterior facade, one
color must be used as the primary theme with others used only
sparingly to complement or accent the design.
(b) When making a transition from one color to the next, the
change must occur at bard-edge or change in depth in the
facade which creates a surface for one color to terminate into
before the next one begins (1 in Figure 13).
G. Signs and sign lighting.
(1) All new signs, facade lettering and sign lighting must be approved
by the Planning Board.
(2) Installing new signs which cover or obscure architectural features
of existing historic structures is prohibited. Installing new signs
which are incompatible with the architectural style, scale, location,
materials or color of an existing historic structure is prohibited.
(3) All properties must display their street number on the front facade
next to or above the primary entry. Street numbers should be sized
235. Editor's Note: Figure 14 is included at the end of this chapter.
236. Editor's Note: Figure 13 is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 405-31.1 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-31.1

according to the lettering size chart in Figure 15,237 and should
contrast well with their background.
(4) Commercial properties are permitted one instance of a surfacemounted
signboard or applied facade lettering per commercial
tenant.
(a) The allowable size of lettering on signboards or applied facade
lettering is specified in Figure 15, Lettering Size Chart, based
on the distance from the street to the front facade.
(b) The allowable size of signboards is specified in Figure 16, Sign
Layout, based on the size of the lettering.238
(c) New commercial construction must design the front facade
specifically to accommodate an area or areas for surfacemounted
signs or applied facade lettering. The applied facade
lettering or signboard should be framed by the architecture of
the facade itself whenever possible. Areas of the facade
specifically designed for signs and lettering should be sized
roughly according to Figure 16, Sign Layout. However, the
Planning Board permits flexibility in the length of this area to
allow businesses with longer names to replace businesses with
shorter names.
[1] Continuous, uninterrupted fascia designs meant only as a
backdrop to sign placements are not permitted.
[2] Commercial properties with multiple tenants must
coordinate the size, placement and design of signs and
street numbers so as to present a consistent appearance.
[3] Signs or lettering which is mourned on the vertical,
horizontal or sloped surfaces of the building roof or on roof
fascias are not permitted.
(5) Sign text or applied lettering must be limited to the name of the
business and an optional brief description of the nature of the
business or slogan only. Business logos, if used, must be sized
according to Figure 16, Sign Layout.
(6) Businesses which are not immediately visible from the road may, in
addition to a surface-mounted or applied facade lettering sign,
have one freestanding sign placed near the road. Freestanding
signs must be sized and placed according to Figure 17,
Freestanding Signs.239

§ 405-31.1 (RESERVED) § 405-31.1
401:1059
(a) If this property contains more than one business, those
businesses must share a common freestanding sign.
(b) Street address numbers should be included on all freestanding
signs (1 in Figure 17).
(c) Businesses which utilize a freestanding sign must limit the size
of their facade signs or lettering and the lettering on the
freestanding sign to that allowed for a building which is 21 feet
from the street.
(7) In addition to the signs allowed in this section, commercial
properties are permitted to have window lettering.
(8) All signs should be clear and legible. The lettering used should
contrast well with the background color and have a width-to-height
ratio which is roughly square. Stretched fonts and multicolored
text are prohibited unless expressly part of the business logo
design.
(9) Sign lighting, if used, must be provided only from shielded,
downward facing lamps which direct light only around the
immediate sign surface as illustrated in Figure 18.240 Bare bulbs
must not be readily visible from the public way. Illumination levels
on the surface of the sign face should not exceed two footcandles.
Illuminated signs are encouraged to utilize light-colored lettering
on a dark background to reduce glare.
(a) Internally lit signs are prohibited.
(b) Laser-light, pulsing, flashing or LED (light emitting diode)
signs are prohibited.
(c) Neon signs may be permitted with approval, provided that the
neon tubes comprise the sign lettering only.
(d) Sign lighting must be turned off by 10:00 p.m., or at the close
of business, whichever is later.
(10) Temporary signs.
(a) A single temporary sign advertising a special event or
announcement is permitted no more than four times a calendar
year for any commercial business, provided they are limited to
a maximum of six square feet (each side), are located on the
business premises and are displayed for no more than seven
consecutive days.
(b) Temporary signs, such as those provided for announcing public
election candidates, real estate for sale, contracting work or
similar purposes are permitted, provided they are no larger
240. Editor's Note: Figure 18 is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 405-31.1 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-31.1
401:1060
than 12 square feet (each side) and are removed immediately
after the completion of the event. Temporary signs announcing
new commercial construction projects must not exceed 32
square feet.
(c) Sign trailers, signs on wheels or signs placed on vehicles are
prohibited.
(d) Temporary signs must be located in accordance with the
setbacks for freestanding signs.
(e) Banners, streamers, balloons, blimps and similar advertising
devices are prohibited.
(11) Preexisting businesses which do not currently conform to these
sign requirements must submit new sign designs for approval
within three years of the date of adoption of this section.
H. Exterior lighting.
(1) All exterior lighting used for signs, walkways, docks, parking lots,
canopies, security and facade lighting should be full cut-off or
recessed fixtures which project light downward only, with no
exposed bulbs readily visible from the public way. The light from
these fixtures should not spill over into adjacent properties, and
provide only as much illumination as required on the target
surfaces as specified in Figure 21.241
(a) Sidewalk lighting fixtures along the street must be of Style A or
B and must not exceed 22 feet or 12 feet in height respectively.
(b) Esplanade, waterfront access path or other walkway lighting
must be of Style B and not exceed 12 feet in height.
(c) Parking and security lighting must not exceed 18 feet in height.
(d) Facade lighting must be shielded and mounted so as to only
distribute light directly up or down along the plane of the
facade.
(e) Landscape lighting may be directed upwards with Planning
Board approval only, provided that the fixtures are fully
shielded and no bare bulbs are readily visible from the public
way. Landscape lighting should not exceed two feet in height.
(f) Dock lighting must be shielded, directed downward and not
exceed three feet in height.
(2) Internally lit canopies and awnings are prohibited.
(3) Metal halide and incandescent lamps are recommended for typical
exterior uses. Mercury vapor, low-pressure sodium and high-

pressure sodium can be used with Planning Board approval only.
Neon and laser lights are prohibited.
A. General.
(1) Purpose. These standards were created to protect the existing
historic development patterns and aesthetics within the Broadway
Overlay District and promote new development which enhances the
visual appearance of the City. They are intended to act as a tool for
property owners, developers and planners to help streamline the
design approval process by specifying the desired development
characteristics up front during the design process. Figures
illustrating many of the concepts herein are included at the end in
Appendix 1.242
(2) Applicability. This section applies to all new development,
redevelopment, facade work or other exterior improvements which
require a building permit; work involving the addition or
modification of exterior commercial signage, material colors and
lighting or other exterior work within the Broadway Overlay
District.
(3) Severability. Should any section, paragraph, sentence, clause, word
or provision of this section be declared void, invalid or
unenforceable, for any reason, such decision shall not affect the
remaining provisions of this chapter.
(4) In the event of a conflict between this section and other portions of
the Zoning Code, the Zoning Enforcement Officer (ZEO) will
determine which requirement governs. Improvements under these
standards are subject to applicable Americans with Disabilities Act
Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG).
(5) The Heritage Area Commission is hereby designated as the Review
Board to review proposals governed by this § 405-31.2 and to
perform all of the functions of the "Review Board" as hereinafter
set forth. [Amended 8-7-2012, approved 8-9-2012]
(6) Prior to the commencement of any work governed by this section,
documentation of the proposed work shall be submitted to the
Review Board for assessment of compliance with this section. The
Review Board is authorized optionally to refer the applicant's
proposal to other local agencies, including, but not limited to, the
Zoning Board of Appeals, Heritage Area Committee or other design
review body for comments and recommendations prior to making a
decision.
242. Editor's Note: Appendix 1 is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 405-31.1 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-31.2
401:1062
(7) The Review Board is required to issue a decision to approve, or
deny with design recommendations, a proposal based on its
compliance with this section within a period of 60 days from the
date of submission. Failure to issue a decision within the time
period shall constitute approval of design considerations covered
by this section, unless such time period is extended by motion of
the Board.
(8) All proposed work within the Broadway Overlay District must
preserve, protect and incorporate the exterior facades of existing
historic structures into any proposed development plans. Historic
structures are defined in this section as any construction which is
listed on, or is eligible to be listed on, the National Historic
Register, NYS Historic Register and City of Kingston list of
designated properties.
(9) All proposed work within the Broadway Overlay District must
preserve, protect and incorporate the original forms and shapes of
existing roofs on historic structures into any proposed development
plans.
(10) All proposed work within the Broadway Overlay District must make
reasonable attempts to preserve, protect and incorporate existing
buildings and/or their facades into any proposed development
plans through renovation and adaptive reuse.
(11)Waivers.
(a) The Review Board is hereby empowered and authorized to
waive or vary any design standards or requirements in this
section within the Broadway Overlay District by a majorityplus-
one vote. Any such waiver must be accompanied by a
written findings statement outlining the reasons such waiver is
merited, and may be exercised in the event of the following:
[1] The nonconforming elements meet the spirit and intent of
the design goals contained herein as defined by the Review
Board; and
[2] The specific standards or requirements are not
appropriate to a particular development or project.
(b) The Review Board shall also have the authority to impose
reasonable and appropriate conditions on the grant of any
waiver to protect the district.
(12) In addition to any required site plan application submissions, new
site development plans in the Overlay District are required to
submit the following:
(a) Site plan which specifies all proposed demolition and
construction work and includes:
§ 405-31.2 (RESERVED) § 405-31.2
401:1063
[1] Existing structures and pedestrianways on adjacent
properties that are within 50 feet of all property lines.
(b) Building elevations, at a minimum scale of 1/8 inch equals one
one foot, of all facades, which specifies all proposed demolition
and construction work and includes:
[1] Exterior materials, changes or transitions in materials,
surface lighting, surface signs, street number, awnings
and similar facade accessories.
[2] Proposed alterations or changes to existing facades, if any.
[3] Elevations of new buildings being proposed must include
the full facades of any adjacent structures within 50 feet of
the site along Broadway for context.
(c) Samples of any new proposed facade, roofing and sign
materials.
(d) Site plan indicating exterior lighting photometrics, spread and
intensity.
(e) A perspective color rendering illustrating what the proposal
would look like if viewed from the street as a pedestrian.
(f) Photographs of the site and surrounding area, including all
existing elements required to be shown on the site plans and
existing buildings within 50 feet of the proposed project site.
(13) Facade alteration or renovation proposals in the Overlay District
are required to submit the following:
(a) Building elevations, at a minimum scale of 1/8 inch equals one
foot, of all facades, which specifies all proposed demolition and
construction work and includes:
[1] Exterior materials, changes or transitions in materials,
surface lighting, surface signs, street number, awnings
and similar facade accessories.
[2] Proposed attentions or changes to existing facades, if any.
(b) Samples of any new proposed facade, roofing and sign
materials.
(c) Photographs of the site and surrounding area, including all
existing elements required to be shown on the site plans and
existing buildings within 50 feet of the proposed project site.
(14) Signage or exterior lighting proposals in the Overlay District are
required to submit the following:
§ 405-31.2 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-31.2
401:1064
(a) Drawings of the proposed sign or copy change, at a minimum
scale of one inch equals one foot, of all signs or lettering, which
includes some context of the building facade where it is
proposed to be mounted.
(b) Other sign information regarding illumination methods, hours
of illumination and mounting method.
(c) Photographs of the site or building which include the proposed
sign or lighting mounting location, any existing signs or
lighting and the adjacent properties.
(d) Documentation, such as cut-sheets from the manufacturer, of
any proposed lighting or light fixture, which includes photos,
illustrations and performance data of the lamp.
B. Site planning, parking and landscaping standards. All new development
within the Overlay District must comply with the following:
(1) New construction must align the front facade of the building at, or
as close as possible to, the front facade of an existing building on an
adjacent property. In the case of a discrepancy of setbacks, the new
building should align with at least one of the neighboring buildings,
or as directed by the Review Board (1 in Figure 1).
(2) New construction should attempt to work with any preexisting
building patterns found in adjacent or nearby buildings with
regards to massing, height, scale and form.
(3) New construction should place as much of the building width at the
front of the lot as possible to maximize front facade exposure and
maintain the street wall. The front facade should be kept parallel to
the street (2 in Figure 1).
(4) The use of landscaping methods, such as low walls, hedges and tree
rows, should be used to help maintain and reinforce a consistent
street wall in areas where there are no building facades to define it
(3 in Figure 1).
(5) The primary entry on all new construction should be easily
identifiable, scaled appropriately to the size of the building and
should always face the street. In cases where the primary building
entry should also be visible from an on-site parking area adjacent to
the building, the entry may be placed at the corner of the structure
so that it is may be visible from both the street and the parking area
(4 in Figure 1).
(6) New construction located at corner intersections should place a
majority of the building mass at the corner and/or wrap the corner
by continuing facade elements such as the cornice on all street
elevations.
§ 405-31.2 (RESERVED) § 405-31.2
401:1065
(7) All required off-street parking areas should be located at the side or
rear of the building. No parking areas are allowed between the
front facade of the building and the curb (5 in Figure 1).
(8) All on-site parking, vehicle loading or service areas located within
sight of the street must be screened from view using architectural
or landscaping methods as directed by the Review Board.
(9) On-site parking areas, vehicle loading or service areas should
connect to any existing service alleys or adjacent parking areas, if
available, to allow alternate means of egress (6 in Figure 1).
(10) Proposed on-site parking areas should be located next to any
adjacent existing parking lots if possible to provide shared parking
opportunities which can serve neighboring buildings
simultaneously. Such shared arrangements should share a single
curb cut and/or provide direct access from one lot to the other, as
directed by the Review Board.
(11) Large parking areas in excess of 30 spaces must provide
landscaped islands and buffers which break up the visual expanse
of paved area as directed by the Review Board. Such medians
should include grass, plantings and trees which are spaced a
minimum of 30 feet on center (7 in Figure 1).
(12) Properties are limited to no more than one curb-cut access to the
main street, unless otherwise approved by the Review Board. Curb
cuts should only be as wide as necessary to accommodate needed
travel lanes. Curb-cut radiuses must be no larger than five feet (9 in
Figure 1).
(13) Larger developments which may include multiple buildings within
the same city block should include pedestrian paths, access routes
or plazas through the site which are publicly accessible.
(14) City-approved tree grates should be used at new tree locations
when incorporated into paving (1 in Figure 2).
(15) These pedestrian and parking areas must meet all requirements of
the Americans with Disabilities Act, including transitions from one
property to another.
C. Height, scale and massing. New construction in the Overlay District
must comply with the following height, scale and massing
requirements:
(1) Two-story minimum building height is required on front facades
facing Broadway.
(a) The City may elect to waive the two-story facade height
requirement in some instances where it is deemed
inappropriate or where it may create an undue financial
burden on the applicant.
§ 405-31.2 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-31.2
401:1066
(b) The second floor facade area of new construction must provide
habitable space measuring at least 12 feet in depth measured
back from the front facade. No false facades are permitted as a
means of meeting the two-story minimum requirement.
(2) The majority of the building mass should be placed at the front of
the site to maximize front facade exposure and maintain the street
wall; however the building height may step down to lower levels in
the rear. Corner lots should place a majority of the building mass or
height at the corner to visually anchor the block.
(3) The height of new buildings should coordinate common heights and
facade lines with immediately adjacent buildings (1 in Figure 3).
(4) Structures with sloping roof designs should align the gable end of
the facade to face the street to maximize facade exposure.
(5) For the purposes of determining effective facade height on
buildings with sloping roofs, the height of structures with gable
ends facing the street should be measured by the vertical distance
from the ground to the peak of the roof. Structures which have
their roof ridge running parallel to the street should be measured
by the vertical distance from the ground to the lowest part of the
roof.
(6) Maximum parapet height is four feet unless otherwise required by
state or federal codes.
(7) No portion of the roofline may extend more than 50 feet in length
horizontally without a roofline transition. A "roofline transition" is
defined as a change in the height of the roofline where it steps (up
or down) at least 24 inches. Such transitions should not occur more
than once in a four-foot span along the facade (2 in Figure 3).
(8) Facade and roofline transitions should be used to highlight
important areas of the facade such as a building entry, the center of
the facade, or the symmetrical ends (2 in Figure 3).
(9) Most of the existing building facades within the district are
composed of base, middle and top levels which are readily
discernable from each other, and new facade designs should be
compatible with that framework (1 in Figure 4).
(a) The base level should roughly align with those on nearby
buildings (3 in Figure 3) and often rests on a small plinth or
watertable which creates a transition between it and the
ground.
(b) The top level is created by a roof or cornice which is designed
to provide a visual cap to the building overall and creates a
noticeable transition between the building and the sky (3 in
Figure 4).
§ 405-31.2 (RESERVED) § 405-31.2
401:1067
(10)New facade designs should be in keeping with the scale of adjacent
buildings. The use of an overall facade composition which breaks
the building down into smaller and regular portions, such as bays
defined by groups of windows, helps to achieve this (5 in Figure 3
and Figure 4).
(11) Small-scale building materials similar to those recommended in
Table 1243 are required as the primary building material along the
front facade of all new construction.
(12) Areas of blank wall larger than an eight-foot diameter circle are not
permitted on the front facades of new construction (6 in Figure 4).
Such blank wall is defined as an area of facade which does not
contain any decorative articulation of materials which measure at
least two inches in depth, or openings such as windows and doors.
D. Roofs.
(1) Flat roofs with parapets and gable roofs are historically the most
common roof forms found within the district, and new construction
should be compatible with that framework. Mansard roofs, shed
roofs, fake roof fronts, built-out roof frames which are hung from
the facade and similar applied designs are prohibited as primary
roof types.
(2) New construction with a flat roof is required to be capped by an
architectural cornice design that is a sculptural expression of the
primary facade material, wood or simulated wood design, at the top
of the front facade(s). This articulated parapet or cornice design
must be at least 12 inches tall on one-story facades and at least 24
inches tall on facades of two or more stories. The size, depth and
relief of any proposed cornice should be compatible with those
found on nearby buildings of the same height and include suitable
depth to create noticeable shadows (4 in Figure 3 and Figure 4).
Maximum parapet height is four feet unless otherwise required by
state or federal codes.
(3) New construction with a sloped roof must have a minimum roof
pitch of no less than 5:12 on primary roof areas (not including
dormers, entry canopies or similar secondary roof elements) or a
maximum pitch of 12:12.
(a) The tallest portion of the roof must be orientated to place at
least one gable end facing the street.
(b) Roof overhangs at the eave and gable ends must be at least
eight inches deep.
243. Editor's Note: Table 1 immediately follows Subsection F.
§ 405-31.2 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-31.2
401:1068
(4) New roof construction must be designed so as to divert the fall of
rain and snow away from pedestrian areas, such as walkways and
doors.
(5) Air-handling units, condensers, satellite dishes and other
equipment placed on the roof must be located and screened from
view so as to not be readily visible from the street or waterway. The
Review Board may require that roof-mounted equipment be visually
minimized with painted colors and finish complementary to the
overall building design and set back or screened to be out of the
sheet viewshed whenever feasible, as directed by the Review
Board.
(6) See materials list in Table 1244 for approved roof materials.
E. Facade composition and fenestration.
(1) The front facades of new flat roof construction must be organized in
a general base - middle - top configuration (Figures 3 and 4).
(a) The base level consists of the most open and sculptural facade
expression at the first floor. The amount of door and window
openings should be the greatest here, typically between 75%
and 90% of the facade, in this ground floor area.
[1] Individual window openings in the facade cannot exceed
12 feet in width and must be separated from each other by
at least 18 inches of facade. Window glass area cannot
exceed five feet in width without being separated by at
least six inches of mullion.
[2] Window frames must be recessed at least three inches
back from the plane of the facade. Flush or curtain wall
windows designs are not permitted.
[3] The primary entry doorway to the street must be recessed
between 12 inches and 48 inches back from the plane of
the facade, expressing the greatest amount of facade
depth (6 in Figure 3).
[4] The base level should be crowned by an entablature
element or other transition having a change in depth,
materials and color which differentiates it from the upper
levels. The entablature element should be designed to
accommodate facade lettering or signs for the property.
See Subsection G, Signs and lighting.
(b) The middle level consists of the upper floors, and has a lower
fenestration level than the first floor. The amount of facade
articulation and openings should be less here than that found
244. Editor's Note: Table 1 immediately follows Subsection F.
§ 405-31.2 (RESERVED) § 405-31.2
401:1069
at the ground floor, typically between 25% and 50% of the
facade in this area (4 in Figures 3 and 4).
[1] Individual window openings in the facade at this level
cannot exceed six feet in width, and must be separated
from each other by at least 24 inches of facade. Window
glass area at this level cannot exceed three feet in width
without being separated by at least four inches of mullion.
[2] Window frames must be recessed at least two inches back
from the plane of the facade.
(2) The front facades of new construction with masonry exteriors are
required to visually express the structural lintels over windows,
doors, archways and similar openings (6 in Figure 4). See materials
list in Table 1245 for a listing of approved lintel materials.
(3) The rhythm of facade elements across the front facade must be
arranged in an easily recognizable pattern, such as a repeating or
symmetrical layout. Breaks or fluctuations to the facade pattern
should be reserved to highlight areas of special interest, such as
entry points to the building (1 in Figure 5).
(a) New construction directly adjacent to or added to existing
structures should be compatible with the rhythm of facade
elements of the existing building.
(4) The proportion of facade elements, such as windows, window
divisions and bays, must have a vertical orientation (taller than
they are wide) of at least x wide to 1.5x tall. The proportions of
individual elements should be used consistently throughout the
design, such that all windows and their divisions are generally of
the same proportion (2 in Figure 5).
(a) New construction directly adjacent to or added to existing
structures should be compatible with the proportion of facade
elements of the existing building.
(b) Horizontally proportioned elements (wider than they are tall)
must be used sparingly. Strong horizontal influences, such as
overly bold fascias, strip windows or repeatedly banding
designs of brick are prohibited.
(c) The proportion of structural facade elements, such as columns,
pilasters and posts, must be designed accordingly with the
weight they appear to be carrying.
F. Materials and colors.
(1) All proposed work within the Overlay District must preserve,
protect and maintain the use of original exterior materials of
245. Editor's Note: Table 1 immediately follows Subsection F.
§ 405-31.2 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-31.2
401:1070
historic structures whenever possible. If replacement is necessary,
replace with like materials which have the same basic forms and
proportions.
(a) Existing exterior materials removed for demolition should be
salvaged for use in patching or as new exterior material in
additions whenever possible.
(b) Additions to existing historic structures must use exterior
materials which match the basic form, proportions and
material of the original building. Exact material matches for
color and texture are not required.
(c) The covering or concealing of existing historic exterior
materials with new materials is prohibited. The Review Board
may require that newer existing exterior materials be removed
to reveal historical surfaces underneath, if appropriate.
(2) All proposed work within the Overlay District must make
reasonable attempts to preserve, protect and maintain the original
design and exterior materials on existing front facades whenever
possible. If replacement is necessary, replace with like materials
which have the same basic forms and proportions.
(a) Any renovations or alterations to an existing facade should
include reasonable attempts to remove any modern day
cladding, panels, signboards or similar additions which are
concealing the original building design underneath. The
Review Board may require that newer existing exterior
materials be removed to reveal original surfaces underneath, if
appropriate.
(b) Original facade materials and designs should be repaired and
preserved whenever possible in lieu of replacement or
covering with new materials. The removal or covering of
original exterior materials with new materials is prohibited
unless it can be demonstrated that repairing the original
construction would be creating undue financial hardship in the
opinion of the Review Board, and approved by the Review
Board.
(3) Smaller scale materials are required on front facades of all new
construction. See materials list in Table 1246 for recommended
materials.
(4) When using more than one material on the exterior facade, one
material must be used as the primary theme with others used only
sparingly to complement or accent the design. The use of a variety
of design styles or materials across the facades of the same
building is prohibited.

(5) When making a transition from one material to the next, the change
must occur at hard-edge or depth transition in the facade which
creates a surface for one material to terminate into before the next
one begins (1 in Figure 6).
(6) Special designs or decorative patterns created in the exterior
materials are encouraged.
(7) All exterior colors must be of a natural, muted shade. Brighter,
more vibrant colors, if used, must be reserved for minor accents
and highlights only. All exterior colors must be approved by the
Review Board.
(8) When using more than one color on the exterior facade, one color
must be used as the primary theme with others used only sparingly
to complement or accent the design.
(9) When making a transition from one color to the next, the change
must occur at hard-edge or change in depth in the facade which
creates a surface for one color to terminate into before the next one
begins (1 in Figure 6).

$10,000 and over 10
(g) All other signs prohibited in § 405-36.
(7) Sign sizing, design and mounting requirements.
(a) The allowable size of sign lettering is specified in Table 2,
Lettering Size Chart.248 The allowable size of signboards is
based on the size of the allowed lettering using the diagram
illustrated in Figure 8.249
[1] The diagram in Figure 8 illustrates how the overall size of
the signboard is limited to that required for the business
name, the business description or motto, an optional logo
and the empty spaces between. All of these elements are a
function of the maximum letting size X.
[2] Once the overall size of the board is determined, the actual
layout and arrangement of text can be changed to
accommodate the desired look (Figures 12, 13 and 18).
248. Editor's Note: Table 2 immediately follows Subsection G(7)(f).
249. Editor's Note: Figure 8 is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 405-31.2 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-31.2
401:1078
(b) Sign text or applied lettering must be limited to the name of
the business and an optional brief description of the nature of
the business or slogan only. Business logos, if used, should be
sized roughly according to the diagram in Figure 8, Signboard
Sizing.
(c) Commercial properties with multiple tenants must coordinate
the size, placement and design of signs and street numbers so
as to present a consistent appearance.
(d) Surface applied facade lettering which is framed by the
architectural features of the facade is preferred to signboards
and should be utilized whenever appropriate (Figures 10 and
11).
(e) Installing new signs which cover or obscure architectural
features of existing structures is prohibited. Installing new
signs which are incompatible with the architectural style,
scale, location, materials or color of an existing facade is
prohibited.
(f) New commercial construction must design the front facade
specifically to accommodate an area or areas for applied
facade lettering or surface-mounted signs. The applied facade
lettering or signboard should be framed by the architecture of
the facade itself whenever possible (1 in Figure 7; Figures 10,
11 and12). Areas of the facade specifically designed for signs
and lettering should be sized roughly according the diagram in
Figure 8, Signboard Sizing. However, the Review Board
permits flexibility in the length of this area to allow businesses
with longer names to later replace businesses with shorter
names.

§ 405-32. Special permits.
On application and after public notice and hearing, the Planning Board may
authorize, by resolution, the issuance of a special permit only for those uses
in a district where this chapter requires such a permit. In authorizing the
issuance of a special permit, the Board shall take into consideration the
public health, safety and welfare and shall prescribe appropriate conditions
and safeguards to insure the accomplishment of the following objectives.

A. Objectives.
(1) That all proposed structures, equipment or material shall be readily
accessible for fire and police protection.
(2) That the proposed use is of such location, size and character that,
in general, it will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly
development of the district in which it is proposed to be situated
and will not be detrimental to the orderly development of adjacent
properties in accordance with the zoning classification of such
properties.
(3) That, in addition to the above, in the case of any use located in or
directly adjacent to a residential district:
(a) The location and size of such use, the nature and intensity of
operations involved in or conducted in connection therewith,
its site layout and its relation to access streets shall be such
that both pedestrian and vehicular traffic to and from the use
§ 405-31.2 (RESERVED) § 405-32
401:1083
and the assembly of persons in connection therewith will not
be hazardous or incongruous with said residential district or
conflict with the normal traffic of the neighborhood.
(b) The location and height of buildings, the location, nature and
height of walls and fences and the nature and extent of
screening and landscaping on the site shall be such that the
use will not hinder or discourage the appropriate development
and use of adjacent land and buildings or diminish the value
thereof.
B. Procedure. The procedure for a special permit shall be the same as set
forth in the General City Law § 27-b. [Amended 12-16-1999 by L.L.
No. 2-2000; approved 1-3-2000]
C. Application. Every application for a special permit shall be submitted in
two copies and shall contain the relevant items outlined in § 405-30F, as
determined during the presubmission conference.
D. Except as to special permits issued pursuant to § 405-27.1, in
authorizing the issuance of a special permit, it shall be the duty of the
Planning Board to attach such conditions and safeguards as may be
required in order that the results of its action may, to the maximum
extent possible, further the general objectives of this chapter. The
Board may require that special permits be periodically renewed. Such
renewal shall be granted following due public notice and hearings and
may be withheld only upon a determination that such conditions as may
have been prescribed by the Board in conjunction with the issuance of
the original permit have not been, or are no longer being, complied
with. In such cases, a period of 60 days shall be granted the applicant
for full compliance prior to the renovation of said permit. Any use for
which a special permit may be granted shall be deemed to be a
conforming use in the district in which such use is located, provided
that: [Amended 8-7-2012, approved 8-9-2012]
(1) The provision in this chapter under which such permit was issued is
still in effect.
(2) Such permit was issued in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter.
(3) Such permit shall be deemed to affect only the lot or portion
thereof for which such permit shall have been granted.
(4) All applicable provisions of this chapter not otherwise varied by the
special permit approval are adhered to.
E. No special permit shall be authorized for any activity in an L Landmark
Overlay District until such application shall have been referred to the
Landmark Preservation Commission in accordance with the site plan
procedure outlined in § 405-30D.

F. Mixed Use Overlay District. [Added 8-7-2012, approved
8-9-2012250]
(1) Any special permit issued pursuant to § 405-27.1 (Mixed Use
Overlay District) shall initially be issued for a period of one year.
The Planning Board shall have the authority to renew the permit for
such period as it determines.
(2) Renewal of the permit issued pursuant to § 405-27.1 may be denied
upon a determination that the conditions set forth in the permit
have not been complied with, on account of violations of the New
York State Uniform Fire Safety and Building Code or for reasons of
public safety. With respect to special permits issued pursuant to
§ 405-27.1, the Planning Board need not provide a period of time
for the applicant to comply with the conditions of the permit, to
cure violations of the New York State Uniform Fire Safety and
Building Code and/or matters affecting public safety.
G. Any person or persons, jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of
the Planning Board concerning review of a special permit, may bring a
proceeding to review in a manner provided by Article 78 of the Civil
Practice Law and Rules in a court of record on the ground that such
decision is illegal, in whole or in part.
A. No driveway to or from any public garage or automobile service station
shall be within 200 feet (measured along the street line on that side of
the street on which such public garage or automobile service station
has its main frontage and on which such driveway would cross) of the
boundary line of any residence district or of any school, church, park,
playground, hospital, public library, institution for dependents or
children or any place of public assembly designed for the simultaneous
use of 100 persons or more, regardless of the district where either
premises is located.
B. No service station building and no gasoline or oil pump or service
appliance, unless within a building, shall be within 15 feet of any street
line.
C. There shall be no opening in the walls or roof of any public garage,
except chimney openings and emergency fire doors, within 15 feet of

frames.
D. All automobile parts, wrecked or damaged motor vehicles or similar
articles shall be stored within an approved enclosed area. Major repair
work may be carried on outdoors where it is impracticable to do such
work within a building, but in no case shall any vehicles requiring such
250. Editor's Note: This ordinance also provided for the redesignation of former Subsection F
as Subsection G.
§ 405-32 (RESERVED) § 405-33
401:1085
§ 405-34. Off-street parking and loading.
work be stored outdoors for a period exceeding 30 days. Gasoline or oil
sales, changing of tires and other similar automobile servicing shall not
be considered to be major repair work.
E. No automobile service station and no gasoline or oil pump or
automotive service appliance, unless within a building, shall be
permitted to be established on a lot that is within 1,000 feet of another
lot on which there is an existing automobile service station or outdoor
gasoline or oil pump or automotive appliance or of another lot for which
a building permit has been issued for the erection of such a station,
pump or service appliance. This requirement shall in no way be
construed to cause any existing use to become nonconforming, except
that if such a use has been discontinued for any reason for a period of
over one year or has been changed to or replaced by a conforming use,
such use shall be subject to the provisions of Article VI hereof.
A. Landscaping. Whenever a parking area containing three or more spaces
faces a street or a property line, a planting area of a minimum width of
three feet with plantings at least three feet high planted three feet on
center shall be provided between the parking area and the street line or
property line. The planting plan for this strip shall be approved by the
Planning Board as part of the site plan review. Further, not more than
12 parking spaces shall be permitted in a continuous row, and not more
than 24 spaces shall be permitted in a single parking area without being
interrupted by landscaping approved by the Planning Board. However,
if a parking area is located in a side or rear yard, the Planning Board
shall have the authority to waive the landscaping requirement of not
having more than 12 parking spaces in a continuous row without being
interrupted by landscaping. [Amended 6-6-1995; approved
6-8-1995]
B. Screening. Where a parking area for three or more vehicles abuts a
residential property, it shall be screened from view by landscaping an
opaque fence or wall or other means approved by the Planning Board.
C. Two or more uses on the same lot. Except as specified in Subsection D,
where two or more different uses occur on a single lot, the total amount
of parking facilities to be provided shall be the sum of the requirements,
if any, for each individual use on the lot.
D. Joint use of parking areas.
(1) In the case of two or more establishments on the same lot or on
contiguous lots, the Planning Board may approve the joint use of
parking areas with a total capacity of not less than 50% of the sum
of the spaces required for cars and using the same driveways
giving access thereto, provided that the same Board finds that the
proposed capacity will substantially meet the intent of the
requirements by reason of variation in the probable time of
§ 405-33 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-34
401:1086
maximum use by patrons or employees among such
establishments.
(2) Joint use of parking areas shall be subject to the following
requirements:
(a) If a use is enlarged or changed, the Planning Board shall have
the discretion to require full compliance for each separate use
upon finding that conditions justifying joint use no longer exist.
(b) Such area shall be sufficient to provide the total number of
parking and loading units required collectively of the
participating owners.
(c) An agreement for the construction, use and maintenance of
such joint parking and loading area, and the cost thereof, shall
be entered into by all participating owners on a basis deemed
equitable by the Planning Board, and the continuance of such
agreement and such proper maintenance shall be guaranteed
by a covenant filed with the site plan and attached to the deed
of each participating property binding each participating
owner and his successors in interest for the life of the joint use
of the facility and a bond in an amount sufficient to cover
maintenance and repair as estimated by the City Engineer and
satisfactory to the Corporation Counsel as to form and
adequacy of guaranty, which covenant and bond shall run for a
period of not less than 20 years.
(d) Upon findings that the foregoing conditions have been met and
where the joint parking facility adjoins or straddles a joint lot
line, the Planning Board may, for the period covered by such
agreement and bond, waive temporarily the requirements for
side yards, including landscaping along property lines.
E. Layout and location of off-street parking facilities.
(1) The plans for new buildings or the enlargement of floor areas in
existing buildings or the conversion to additional dwelling units
shall show specifically the location and size of off-street parking
facilities required to comply with any applicable requirements
hereof and the means of access to such space from the public
streets or highways.
(a) Access shall consist of at least one fifteen-foot-wide lane for
parking areas with fewer than 20 spaces and at least two tenfoot-
wide lanes for parking areas with more than 20 spaces.
(b) No entrance or exit to any off-street parking area with a
capacity of more than four spaces shall be located within 50
feet of any street intersection nor exceed a grade in excess of
6% within 25 feet of any street line nor 10% at any other point.
All points of ingress or egress shall be appropriately signed
§ 405-34 (RESERVED) § 405-34
401:1087
unless such signing is considered unnecessary by the Planning
Board.
(c) Where the topography of a site is such that a potential safety
hazard for parked vehicles exists, the Planning Board may
require barriers or other safety devices to be incorporated into
the design of the parking area.
(2) Each required space, exclusive of drives and aisles, shall be not less
than 18 feet long nor less than nine feet wide and shall be served by
an aisle between rows of parking spaces not less than 22 feet wide.
The minimum aisle space may be reduced for angle parking, but in
no case shall the aisle space be less than 16 feet. All spaces shall be
clearly marked. Except as may be otherwise provided, required offstreet
parking facilities may be enclosed in a structure or may be
located in the open, provided that such required parking facilities
are graded, surface drained and maintained to the extent necessary
to avoid nuisances of dust, erosion or excessive water from across
public ways; or paved with asphalt, oil and chip or other material
that is equivalent in durability. Upon a determination by the
Planning Board that the required number of parking spaces would
be greatly in excess of the need of a particular use on a given lot,
said Board may waive the requirement that all such spaces be
surfaced to the extent that it may deem the number required to
exceed the actual need.
(3) Off-street parking areas shall be adequately illuminated for
convenience and safety, but no lighting in parking areas shall cause
glare on adjoining property.
(4) Off-street parking spaces in residential districts shall not project
nearer to the street on which the principal building fronts than the
required front yard setbacks for such building. [Added 7-7-1987;
approved 7-8-1987]
(5) Compact car parking, up to a maximum of 30% of the required
parking, shall be allowed with the approval of the Planning Board.
Such compact car spaces shall be not less than eight feet wide and
16 feet long. Minimum aisle width shall not be less than 22 feet
wide. [Added 7-7-1987 approved 7-8-1987; amended
7-7-1992, approved 7-8-1992]
F. Connections between abutting parking areas. Where appropriate, the
Planning Board may require paved connections between abutting
parking areas in different ownerships so as to facilitate the flow of
traffic.
G. Operation and maintenance of off-street parking facilities. Required offstreet
parking facilities shall be maintained throughout the life of any
use or structure which said facilities are designed to serve. Required
parking areas developed for specific structures and uses shall be
§ 405-34 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-34
401:1088
reserved at all times for the use of those persons who are employed at,
or making use of, such structures and uses, except when dedicated to,
and accepted by, the City as public parking areas.
H. Waiver of parking requirements. All or portions of the on-site off-street
parking requirements may be waived by the Planning Board, provided
that:
(1) The proposed use is within 400 feet of a municipally operated offstreet
parking facility or privately owned and operated parking
area.
(2) The Planning Board shall, at the time of its approval of a site
development plan, certify on such plan that the municipally
operated off-street parking facility or, in the case where a nearby
private parking area is to be utilized, the private parking facility
has adequate capacity for storage of passenger vehicles generated
by activities proposed to be conducted on the subject lot in addition
to those generated by any other lots already serviced by such offstreet
parking facility. In determining the existence of such
adequate capacity, the Planning Board shall consider the need for
preventing frequent parking on the street by persons visiting or
connected with each use which is proposed to be served by such
off-street municipal or private parking facility.
(3) Where a private facility is to be utilized, the applicant shall provide
assurance that such facility will be available for the life of the
proposed use.
I. Effect of parking requirements on existing uses.
(1) Structures and land uses in existence, or for which building permits
shall have been approved as of the effective date of this chapter,
shall not be subject to the requirements for off-street parking
spaces set forth in this chapter, provided that any parking facilities
now existing and serving such structures or uses shall not in the
future be reduced, except to the extent that they exceed such
requirements.
(2) In the event that it is proposed to expand any use not now meeting
the parking requirements, the applicant shall be required to
provide additional facilities so that the use, as expanded, shall meet
fully all parking requirements.
J. Parking space ratios.

§ 405-34 (RESERVED) § 405-34
401:1093
§ 405-35. Cluster developments.
The Planning Board may approve cluster developments in RRR or RR
Districts according to the procedures and requirements specified below.
The purpose of such development is to provide flexibility in design and
development of land in such a way as to promote the most appropriate use
of land, to facilitate the adequate and economical provision of streets and
utilities and to preserve the natural and scenic qualities of open space.
(b) Any land which is developed as a unit under single ownership
and control shall be considered a single lot for the purpose of
these loading requirements.
(2) Size of spaces. Each required loading berth shall be at least 15 feet
wide, 45 feet long and 14 feet high.
(3) Location and access. Said loading berths may be provided in the
principal building or in any side or rear yards. No off-street loading
berths shall be located in any front yard. Unobstructed access, at
least 10 feet wide, to and from a street shall be provided. Such
access may be combined with the access driveway to a parking lot,
provided that said driveway has a minimum width of 25 feet. All
loading berths shall be on the same lot as the use to which they are
accessory. No entrance or exit for any loading area shall be located
within 50 feet of any street intersection.
(4) Joint facilities. Required loading berths, open or enclosed, may be
provided in spaces designed to serve jointly two or more adjacent
establishments, provided that the number of required berths in
such joint facilities shall not be less than the aggregate of all such
requirements.
A. The maximum number of single-family lots that may be approved in a
cluster development shall be computed by subtracting from the total
gross area a fixed percentage of 20% of said area and dividing the
remaining 80% of the area by 10,000 square feet in a RRR Zone and
6,000 square feet in a RR Zone, which will result in a gross density that
is no higher than would occur under conventional development in the
particular zoning district. In computing the maximum number of lots
that may be created, any lands which are subject to flooding or which
are occupied by public utility easements in such a manner as to prevent
their use and development shall not be considered part of the total
gross area.
B. The minimum area of a cluster development shall be 10 acres and shall
be in single ownership or under unified control.
C. Prior to the issuance of a building permit in a cluster development, a
site plan shall be submitted to and approved by the Planning Board in
accordance with § 405-30 and the following conditions:
§ 405-34 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-35
401:1094
§ 405-36. Signs.
(1) Said site plan shall include areas wherein such structures may be
located, the height and spacing of buildings, open spaces and
landscaping, off-street open and enclosed (if any) parking spaces
and streets, driveways and other physical features relevant to the
proposed plan.
(2) Said site plan shall include a statement setting forth the nature of
all proposed modifications of existing zoning provisions.
(3) Said site plan shall be subject to review and public hearing by the
Planning Board in the manner prescribed in the General City Law
§§ 32 and 33 (subdivision regulations).
D. In order to assure proper maintenance of common lands, a cluster
development shall be organized as one of the following:
(1) A home association approved by the Federal Housing
Administration, for mortgage insurance as a planned unit
development, and the City Council;
(2) A home association approved by the Corporation Counsel and City
Council; or
(3) Any other arrangements such as a cooperative or condominium
approved by the Corporation Counsel and City Council as satisfying
the intent of this chapter. Whenever a home association is
proposed, the Corporation Counsel shall retain the right to review
and approve the Articles of Incorporation of said home association
and to require whatever conditions deemed necessary to ensure
that the intent and purpose of this chapter are carried out.
A. Purposes. The purposes of this section are to regulate and control the
location, size, type and design of existing and proposed signs in order
to:
(1) Enhance and protect the City's physical appearance and property
values. [Amended 12-2-1997]
(2) Encourage the most effective and functional use of signs as

(1) Signs mounted on buildings should not cover openings or
architectural details and should be located within areas designed
to house signs, if such exist.

necessary for viewing from adjacent streets. When freestanding
signage is being considered, monument style signage should be
encouraged over pole style, if plausible. [Amended 12-2-1997]
(3) Signs should be of regular shape and should be designed with
respect to the shape and proportion of the space within which they
will be located and the facade to which they will be applied.

observer and the length of time available for viewing; signs
intended for pedestrians on the sidewalk need not be as large as
those to be seen from passing cars.
(5) Signs should include the minimum information necessary to convey
the intended message so as to avoid clutter and confusion.
(6) Multiple signs should be avoided where one will do.
(7) A sign would not obstruct or impair the visual effectiveness of
neighboring signs.
(8) Colors and materials which are discordant with the general
character of the adjacent area should be avoided.
(9) Generally, signs on the same building should be placed within the
same horizontal band and be of similar height.
(10) Wherever possible, signs should be integrated with fences, walls or
buildings rather that freestanding.
(11) Sign material should be durable and require little maintenance.

A. Findings and purpose. The Common Council of the City of Kingston has
become concerned about the effect dish antennas could have on the
welfare and safety of the City. The Common Council finds that, unless
regulated, dish antennas can be installed in a manner which would have
an adverse impact on the use and enjoyment of surrounding properties
including a diminution of property values. If improperly installed, dish
antennas could create a safety hazard. The intent and purpose of this
section is to establish a procedure and criteria to avoid the adverse
impacts of the installation and maintenance of dish antennas and to
preserve the character, safety and general welfare of the municipality.
B. Definitions. For purposes of this section, the terms used herein are
defined as follows:
DISH ANTENNAS  Satellite antennas, parabolic dishes, hemisphere
dishes or other similar antennas, the purpose of which is to send,
transmit or receive television, radio and/or microwave or other similar
signals.[Amended 12-16-1999 by L.L. No. 2-2000, approved
1-3-2000]
C. Special permit required. Installation of a dish antenna, measuring
greater than 24 inches in diameter or any size if located in a Historic
District, shall be subject to the issuance of a special permit by the
Planning Board in accordance with provisions of § 405-32.
D. General requirements.
(1) A dish antenna shall be considered an accessory structure
requiring compliance with all minimum setback and other
requirements of this chapter.
(2) No more than one dish antenna shall be erected, constructed,
installed or maintained on a single lot or premises.
(3) No dish antenna shall be located on any trailer or portable device.
(4) All dish antennas shall be ground mounted. When ground mounting
is not feasible, roof mounting may be permitted. If roof mounting is
permitted, efforts shall be made to locate the dish antenna on the
rear area of roof.
(5) All dish antennas shall be located in rear yards. When a rear yard is
not accessible, or it would be substantially impractical, detrimental
to the character of the neighborhood or cause significant economic
§ 405-37 (RESERVED) § 405-38
401:1105
injury to the property owner to locate the dish antenna in the rear
yard, and a side yard meets all requirements of this chapter, a dish
antenna may be located in the side yard.
(6) All dish antennas shall be screened from the roadway and adjoining
property owners with fencing or foliage, or a combination thereof,
as determined by the Planning Board.
(7) A dish antenna nor any part of the antenna, including any platform
or structure upon which it is mounted or affixed, shall be elevated
to or reach a height of more than eight feet above the natural grade
of the subject premises. In no event shall the natural grade be
changed by any means in order to increase the elevation of the dish
antenna.
(8) The diameter or width of a dish antenna shall not exceed 10 feet.
(9) The use of any illumination for a dish antenna is strictly prohibited.
E. Waiver of requirements. The Planning Board may waive any of the
requirements in this section upon a sufficient showing of excessive cost
or inability to attain reasonable reception.
F. Commercial use. When a dish antenna is to be used for commercial
purposes, the Planning Board, in its discretion, may waive any of the
requirements in this section, and issue a special permit in accordance
with the provisions of Article IV of this chapter.
G. Unsafe, unlawful and unsightly dish antennas. Whenever it shall appear
to the Building Safety Officer that any satellite antenna has been
constructed or erected or is maintained in violation of this section, or is
unsafe and insecure, or has been allowed to deteriorate in appearance
and/or maintenance, or is in such condition as to be a menace to the
safety of the public, the Building Safety Officer shall cause to be issued
a notice in writing to the owner, informing such person of the violation
and directing to make appropriate repairs or alterations thereto within
a reasonable time, as specified in the notice. Upon failure to comply
with such notice, the Building Safety Officer may cause such dish
antenna or such part thereof to be removed and may charge the
expense of such removal to the person so notified. However, nothing
herein shall prevent the Building Safety Officer from taking such
precautionary measures as may be necessary in case of imminent
danger to the public or adjoining property. [Amended 12-16-1999 by
L.L. No. 2-2000; approved 1-3-2000; 3-5-2019 by L.L. No. 1-2019,

A. Findings, purposes and considerations.
(1) In March of 1996, the Common Council of the City of Kingston
commissioned a study of the potential detrimental effects to the
§ 405-46 (RESERVED) § 405-46.1
401:1113
City if adult uses were to be established in close proximity to
sensitive land uses. At the present time there are no land uses
in the City that could be classified as adult uses. Said uses are,
essentially, any businesses that provide for the sale of sexually
orientated goods, services and entertainment in which the
establishment is not customarily open to the general public, but
excludes minors by reason of age.
(2) In April 1996, Greenplan completed its study of adult uses for the
City. After careful review of the Adult Use Study: City of Kingston
Common Council, the Common Council does hereby find that adult
uses could result in potential adverse effects on the City's
residential areas, schools, places of worship, parks and other
designated open space areas, as well as its historic and scenic
resources and civic and cultural facilities.
(3) The Common Council of the City of Kingston also finds and declares
that there are some uses, such as adult uses, which, due to their
very nature, have serious objectionable characteristics. The
objectionable characteristics of these uses are further heightened
by their concentration in any one area thereby having deleterious
effects on other adjacent areas. Special regulation of these uses is
necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to
the blighting and the downgrading of the surrounding
neighborhoods or land uses. This section is being enacted to
accomplish the primary purposes of preventing a concentration of
these uses in any one area and restricting their accessibility to
minors.
(4) Ulster County and its surrounding communities have experienced
an increase in the establishment of adult uses. Based upon recent
studies evaluating the nature and extent of adverse secondary
effects caused by adult uses in commercial and residential areas,
the Common Council of the City of Kingston hereby finds that adult
uses have negative secondary impacts such as increased crime
rates, depreciation of property values and a deterioration of
community character and quality of life.
(5) It is further declared that the location of adult use establishments
near residential zoning districts, schools, places of religious
worship, parks, playgrounds, playing fields or other areas where
our youth may regularly assemble is of great concern to the City of
Kingston, as is the general atmosphere encompassing the
operation of such adult uses.
(6) It is further recognized that the Kingston Police Department's
resources would be strained to adequately address the potential
increased demand for crime prevention. The proliferation of such
uses could dangerously affect the welfare of the entire community
through the degradation of the community's retail areas, as well as
§ 405-46.1 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-46.1
401:1114
the potential decline in property values and overall quality of the
neighborhood.
(7) This section is required to prevent such deleterious secondary
effects. It is the purpose and intent of this section to provide for the
orderly regulation of adult uses in the City of Kingston by
establishing certain minimum standards of the conduct of this type
of business to protect the public order and general welfare of the
residents of the City of Kingston.
B. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:

public generally but excludes any minor by reason of age.
ADULT ENTERTAINMENT CABARET  A public or private
establishment which presents topless or bottomless dancers, strippers,
male or female impersonators, exotic dancers or other similar
entertainment and which establishment is not customarily open to the
public generally but excludes any minor by reason of age.

pictures, films, videotapes or slide shows that are not open to the public

closest structural wall of such adult use to the boundary line of
such residential district.
(3) No adult use establishment shall be located within a five-hundredfoot
radius of a preexisting school, library, civic or youth-oriented
center, designated historic preservation site or district, park,
playground, place of worship, as well as any areas designated as
scenic under New York State law. The five-hundred-foot radius shall
be measured in a straight line from the nearest point of the wall of
the portion of the building in which an adult use business is
conducted to the nearest point on the property of the area in
question.
D. Sign regulations.
(1) Advertisements, displays or other promotional material shall not be
shown or exhibited so as to be visible to the public from pedestrian
sidewalks or walkways or other areas, public or semipublic, and

applicant shows and the Board finds that the following conditions have
been met in addition to the general standards contained in § 405-54,
Powers and duties, of this chapter:
(1) That the proposed use will not be contrary to the public interest or
injurious to nearby properties, and that the spirit and intent of this

the maximum protection of the health, safety and aesthetic sensibilities
of the residents.

Nonconforming Buildings and Uses
§ 405-47. Continuation, alteration or enlargement.
The following provisions shall apply to all buildings and/or uses existing
lawfully on the effective date of this chapter, which buildings and/or uses do
not conform to the requirements set forth in this chapter:
A. Except as provided in § 405-48 below, any type of nonconforming use of
buildings or open land may be continued indefinitely but:
(1) Shall not be enlarged, extended or placed on a different portion of
the lot or parcel of land occupied by such use on the effective date
of this chapter, nor shall any external evidence of such use be
increased by any means whatsoever.
(2) Shall not be changed to another nonconforming use.
(3) Shall not be reestablished if such use has, for any reason, been
discontinued for a period of over one year or has been changed to
or replaced by a conforming use. Intent to resume a nonconforming
use shall not confer the right to do so.
B. Buildings housing nonconforming uses.
(1) Except as provided in Subsection D below, no building which
houses such a nonconforming use shall be:
(a) Structurally altered or enlarged.
(b) Moved to another location where such use would be
nonconforming.
(2) If a building which houses a nonconforming use is destroyed
accidentally due to fire, explosion or other cause, to an extent not
exceeding 50% of its true value as determined by the City Tax
Assessor, such building may be restored within one year in
substantially the same size, form and location, and the same
nonconforming use may be reinstated without being extended. If
destroyed to a greater extent, such building may be restored but
only to house a conforming use.
C. Any building (other than a sign), the use of which is in conformity with
the regulations set forth in this chapter but which building does not
conform to one or more of the requirements hereof, other than the use
requirements or the requirements which apply to buildings located in L
Landmark Overlay Districts, may be altered, enlarged or rebuilt so as to
increase the degree of nonconformity thereof.
D. Nothing in this article shall be deemed to prevent normal maintenance
and repair of any building or the carrying out, upon issuance of a
building permit, of major structural alterations or demolitions
§ 405-47 (RESERVED) § 405-47

§ 405-48. Termination.
necessary in the interest of public safety. In granting such a permit,
the Building Safety Officer shall state the precise reason(s) why such
alterations were deemed necessary. [Amended 12-16-1999 by L.L.
No. 2-2000; approved 1-3-2000; 3-5-2019 by L.L. No. 1-2019,
approved 3-19-2019]
A. Each of the nonconforming uses and each of the nonconforming
features of certain otherwise conforming uses as specified in this
section is deemed sufficiently objectionable, undesirable and out of
character in the district in which such use is located as to depreciate
the value of other property and uses permitted in the district and to
blight the proper and orderly development and general welfare of such
district and the City. To promote public health, safety and welfare and
the most desirable use of which the land of each district may be
adopted and to conserve the value of buildings and enhance the value of
land therein, each such nonconforming use and nonconforming feature
of an otherwise conforming use shall be terminated on or before the
period of time after the effective date of this chapter, which time is
specified hereinafter for the purpose of permitting the amortization of
the remaining cost, if any, of such use:
(1) In any residence district, except for a nonconforming agricultural
use, any use of open land, regardless of the presence of any
buildings thereon, that is made nonconforming as a result of this
chapter shall be discontinued not later than three years after the
effective date of this chapter.
(2) In any residence district, any nonconforming use of buildings which
is not permitted under the provisions of this chapter in any other
residence or shopping center district may be continued for a period
of 10 years after the effective date of this chapter or 30 years after
the initial establishment of such use or any addition thereto adding
50% or more to the real value of such use, whichever is the longer
period, provided that after the expiration of that period such
nonconforming use shall be terminated.
(3) In any district other than a residence district, any use which is
nonconforming because it is not located within a building that is
fully enclosed shall be discontinued not later than one year after
the effective date of this chapter. However, no such use will be
required to terminate if within said period it shall be fully enclosed
within a building or if within said period it shall be surrounded with
a solid fence, of material and design acceptable to the Planning
Board, which fence shall be one foot higher than any material
stored outdoors, provided that such fence shall be maintained in
good condition at all times.
B. If an application is made at least six months before the expiration of the
period prescribed in Subsection A for the termination of a
§ 405-47 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-48
401:1126
nonconforming use or of a nonconforming feature of a conforming
use, and the Board of Appeals shall find that the period prescribed is
unreasonable or inadequate for the amortization of such value of the
property which may be lost by reason of the required termination, such
Board may grant such extension of the period prescribed as it shall be
deemed to be reasonable and adequate for such amortization, provided
that no such period of extension shall exceed the period prescribed,
and provided further that such extension may not be granted more than
once for any use.
C. The continuation of a nonconforming use or of the nonconforming
feature of an otherwise conforming use after the termination date fixed
therefor in Subsection A or as modified pursuant to the provisions of
Subsection B shall constitute a violation of this chapter.

Safety Officer, and then only in compliance and conformity with all the
terms and conditions of such permit.
B. Every application for a building permit shall be made on forms provided
by the Building Safety Officer and shall be accompanied by such fee as
may be prescribed from time to time. Except in the case of alterations of
a building which do not increase the exterior size thereof, such
application shall also be accompanied by two copies of a plot plan
drawn to scale consisting of the following. (Where a site plan approval
or a special permit is necessary, two copies of all maps and supporting
documents shall be submitted; see § 405-30 or 405-32, respectively.)
(1) A survey made by a licensed surveyor showing the actual shape,
dimensions, radiuses, angles and area of the lot on which the
building is proposed to be erected or of the lot on which it is
situated, if an existing building, except that in the event the
structure to be erected is less than 500 square feet and costs
$1,500 or less, the Building Safety Officer may waive the
requirement that a survey made by a licensed surveyor be
furnished, provided that the bounds of the lot are clearly defined on
the site. In such case, a plot plan shall be provided.
(2) The section, block and lot numbers as they appear on the official

chapter.
C. No building permit shall be issued for a building to be used for any use
in the district where such use is allowed by a special permit by the
Planning Board unless and until the issuance of such permit has been
duly authorized by said Board. In instances where site development
plan approval is required, no building permit shall be granted until a
final approval is secured. Where the property concerned is in a
Landmark (L) District, no building, demolition or special permit shall be
issued until the Historic Landmarks Preservation Commission shall
have reported its findings, pursuant to § 405-64 hereof, with respect to
whether the proposed work will adversely affect any Landmark (L)
District or whether any building or special permit should be subject to
specified conditions, in which case any building or special permit shall
be explicitly made subject to such specified conditions. No certificate of
compliance or occupancy shall be issued until the conditions of the
preservation permit and/or building permit have been met. In the event
of an application for a building permit for demolition, the Building
Safety Officer must notify the Historic Landmark Preservation
Commission and must await its report before issuance of said
demolition permit. Absent a report from the Commission within 14 days
of notification, the Building Safety Officer shall proceed as though
Commission approval had been given.
D. The application and all supporting documentation shall be made in
duplicate. On the issuance of a building permit, the Building Safety
Officer shall return one copy of all documents filed to the applicant.

writing the reasons for such denial.

The Zoning Board of Appeals is empowered to authorize, in accordance
with General City Law § 81b(3) and (4), upon denial of a building permit, a
variance from the terms of this chapter. In determining an application for
a variance pursuant to the standards below, the applicant may introduce
and the Board may consider evidence regarding the impact of the requested
variance on the public interest where, owing to exceptional and
extraordinary circumstances, there are practical difficulties or unnecessary
hardships in the way of the carrying out of the strict letter of this chapter.
(2) Default denial of appeal. In exercising its appellate jurisdiction
only, if an affirmative vote of a majority of all members of the

Subsection I above, the appeal is denied. The Zoning Board of

power to grant use variances, authorizing a use of land which otherwise
would not be allowed or would be prohibited by the terms of this
chapter.
(1) No such use variance shall be granted by the Zoning Board of
Appeals without a showing by the applicant that the applicable
zoning regulations and restrictions have caused unnecessary
hardship. In order to prove such unnecessary hardship the
applicant shall demonstrate to the Zoning Board of Appeals that for
each and every permitted use under this Zoning chapter for the
particular district where the property is located:
(a) The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided that
lack of return is substantial as demonstrated by competent
financial evidence.
(b) The alleged hardship relating to the property in question is
unique, and does not apply to a substantial portion of the
district or neighborhood.
§ 405-54 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-55.1
401:1140
(c) The requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood; and
(d) The alleged hardship has not been self-created.
(2) The Zoning Board of Appeals, in granting the use variance, shall
grant the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and
adequate to address the unnecessary hardship proven by the
applicant and, at the same time, preserve and protect the character
of the neighborhood and the health, safety, and welfare of the
community.
B. Area Variances. The Zoning Board of Appeals, upon appeal from the
decision or determination of the enforcement officer, shall have the
power to grant area variances.
(1) In making its determination, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall take
into consideration the benefit to the applicant if the area variance
is granted, as weighed against the detriment to the health, safety
and welfare of the neighborhood or community by such grant. In
making such determination, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall also
consider:
(a) Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the
character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby
properties will be created by the granting of the area variance;
(b) Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved
by some method feasible for the applicant to pursue, other
than an area variance;
(c) Whether the requested area variance is substantial;
(d) Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect or
impact on the physical or environmental conditions in the
neighborhood or district; and
(e) Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created. This
consideration shall be relevant to the decision of the Zoning
Board of Appeals, but shall not necessarily preclude the
granting of the area variance.
(2) The Zoning Board of Appeals, in granting of the area variance, shall
grant the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and
adequate and at the same time preserve and protect the character
of the neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the
community.
C. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall, in granting both use variances and
area variances, have the authority to impose such reasonable
conditions and restrictions as are directly related to and incidental to
the proposed use of the property. Such conditions shall be consistent
with the spirit and intent of this Zoning chapter and Comprehensive
§ 405-55.1 (RESERVED) § 405-55.1
401:1141
§ 405-55.2. Rehearing.
A motion for the Zoning Board of Appeals to hold a rehearing to review
any order, decision or determination not previously reheard may be made
by any member of the Zoning Board of Appeals. A unanimous vote of all
members of the Zoning Board of Appeals then present at the meeting is
required for such rehearing to occur. Such rehearing is subject to the same
notice provisions as an original public hearing. Upon such rehearing, the
Zoning Board of Appeals may reverse, modify or annul its original order,
decision or determination. The vote must be unanimous of all the members
of the Zoning Board of Appeals that are present at the meeting, provided
the Zoning Board of Appeals finds that the rights vested in persons acting
in good faith in reliance upon the reheard order, decision or determination
will not be prejudiced thereby.
§ 405-55.3. Proceedings.
Plan for the City of Kingston, and shall be imposed for the purpose
of minimizing any adverse impact such variance may have on the
neighborhood or community.
D. Once granted, variances run with the land and, once granted, every
subsequent owner of the property shall have the benefit thereof.
A. The powers and duties of the Board of Appeals shall be exercised in
accordance with its own rules of conduct and procedure, which rules
shall be consistent with and pursuant to all the provisions of City law
applicable thereto.
B. In addition, at least 10 days before the date of any public hearing, the
Clerk of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall transmit to the Planning
Office of the City of Kingston and, where the property concerned is in a
Landmark Overlay District, to the Kingston Historic Landmark

of Appeals an advisory opinion on said appeal or application at any time
prior to the public hearing, and such opinion shall be made part of the
official record thereof.
C. The Building Department shall give notice of a variance application or
zoning change request by first-class mail at least 10 days prior to the
public hearing to all properties contiguous and adjacent to the
applicant's property. "Adjacent" shall be deemed to include the

A. Legislative intent.
(1) The purpose of this section is to provide for the promotion of the
educational, cultural, economic and general welfare of the public
through the protection, enhancement, perpetuation and
preservation of landmarks and Landmark (L) Districts. The
legislative body declares that it is in the public interest to ensure
that the distinctive landmarks and Landmark (L) District shall not
be injuriously affected, that the value to the community of those
buildings having architectural and historical worth shall not be
impaired and that said districts be maintained and preserved to
promote their use of the education, pleasure and welfare of the
citizens of the City of Kingston and others.
(2) The Stockade (Area) District of Kingston, consisting of eight blocks
bounded by Clinton Avenue, Main Street, Green Street and North
Front Street, together with protective perimeter, is the site of the
Stockade built by Peter Stuyvesant in 1658 and successive
§ 405-62 KINGSTON CITY CODE § 405-63
401:1148
extensions under English rule.253 In this area, there were two
Indian massacres, one in 1659 and one in 1664. It is also the
location of the founding of the first government of the State of New
York in 1777, burned by the British that same year.
(a) This area, which represents an important heritage relative to
the Dutch and English Colonial periods, is defined on the
Zoning Map and is declared to be a Landmark District (and a
Historic and Architectural Design Overlay District).
(b) This area contains the architecture of the past 300 years, and
new development must not be allowed to erode the best of the
architectural spaces and cultural association of the past.
(3) The Rondout Landmark District consisting of the area as shown on
the map of same annexed to this chapter as Attachment 6:2.254

6:4.256 [Added 7-5-2011 by L.L. No. 7-2011, approved

B. Applicability and guidelines. This section shall apply to all buildings,
structures, outbuildings, walls, fences, steps, topographical fixtures,
earthworks, landscaping, paving and signs of a landmark or Landmark
District. No changes in any exterior architectural feature, including but
not limited to, construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration,
removal, demolition or painting, shall be made except as hereinafter
provided. To assist in the conservation action, several specific
guidelines are included:
(1) Because of the visual importance of the Old Dutch Church steeple,
no new structure may rise within the Stockade District above the
base of the steeple, which is 62 feet above the curb level.
(2) Many of the most important buildings in Landmark Districts are
stone, wood or brick, with only two or three surface materials used
on any building. There are almost no large areas of glass or
polished metal. For this reason, design criteria references in
§ 405-64 and as specified by the Historic Landmarks Preservation

within a Landmark District nor shall any person make any material
change in the appearance of such a property, its light fixtures, signs,
sidewalks, fences, steps, paving or other exterior elements visible from
a public street or alley which affect the appearance and cohesiveness
of the historic district without first obtaining a preservation notice
of action from the Landmarks Commission and a notification to the
applicant to obtain a building permit, if necessary. A preservation notice
of action does not obviate the need for a building permit.
B. Criteria. In making such determinations, the Commission shall
consider:
(1) The effect of the proposed work in changing, destroying or
affecting the exterior features of the landmark or Landmark (L)
District upon which such work is to be done;
(2) The relationship between the results of such work and the exterior
architectural features of other neighboring improvements;

significance, architectural style, design, arrangement, texture,
material and color;
(4) The special character and aesthetic interest that any structure
involved adds to the area; and
(5) The difficulty or impossibility of reproducing any structure involved
because of its design, texture, material, position or detail.
C. All applications shall be considered by the Commission on at least the
following points, these points to be used as a basis, where relevant, for
establishing relationships to the external features of buildings in the
immediate neighborhood: The building height in relation to
surrounding buildings; the relationship to nearby roof shapes; the
relationship between the width to height of the front elevation; the size,
proportion and spacing of openings within the facade and elevations
exposed to view; the rhythm of spacing of buildings and building
elements on the street; the design and placement of entrances and
projections; the relationships of materials, textures and colors; the
relationship of architectural details; the continuity of walls; the
relationship of landscape elements; the appropriateness of paving; and
the effect on existing or historically significant spaces.
D. It shall be the further duty of the Commission to exercise judgment in
accord with the basis of decisions stated herein and maintain the
desirable character of the landmark or Landmark District and prevent
construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition out of harmony
with existing buildings insofar as character, material, color, line and
detail are concerned, and thus to prevent degeneration of property, to
safeguard public health, promote safety and preserve the beauty of the
character of the landmark or Landmark District.

to evaluate the application.
C. Prior to submitting a formal application, the applicant or his
representative may meet with the Commission and/or its staff to
informally discuss plans for alterations of exterior features. In order to
avoid unnecessary expense and delay, a sketch or schematic design for
the construction, alteration or repair of any regulated activity may be
presented to the Commission. A preliminary design should show the
relation to adjacent structures and spaces. The Commission may advise
or recommend alteration and changes in the application.
D. Procedure to be followed for a preservation notice of action.

A. An applicant whose preservation notice of action for a proposed
demolition or alteration has been denied may apply for relief on the
grounds of hardship. The hardship shall not be self-inflicted. In order to
prove the existence of hardship, the applicant shall establish that:
(1) The property is incapable of earning a reasonable return,
regardless of whether that return represents the most profitable
return possible;
(2) The property cannot be adapted for any other use, whether by the
current owner or by a purchaser, which would result in a
reasonable return; and
(3) Efforts to find a purchaser interested in acquiring the property and
preserving it have failed.

§ 405-67. Demolition by neglect.
(1) After receiving written notification from the Commission of the
denial or approval with modifications of a preservation notice of
action, an applicant may commence the hardship process. No
building permit or demolition permit shall be issued unless the
Commission makes a finding that a hardship exists. The
Commission may hold a public hearing on the hardship application,
at which an opportunity will be provided for the proponents and
opponents of the application to present their views.
(2) The applicant shall consult in good faith with the Commission, local
preservation groups and interested parties in a diligent effort to
seek an alternative that will result in preservation of the property.
(3) All decisions of the Commission shall be in writing. A copy shall be
sent to the applicant by registered mail and a copy filed with the
City Clerk's office for public inspection. The Commission's decision
shall state the reasons for granting or denying the hardship
application.
(4) In the event of the Commission's denial based on hardship
application, the applicant may apply to the City of Kingston Zoning
Board for review of said application, applying Landmark Ordinance
criteria.
A. In its review to determine that demolition by neglect is occurring and
upon consultation with the Building Department, the Commission shall
consider all of the foregoing criteria and shall also attempt to confer
with the owner or person in charge of the real property concerned. It
shall also review any communication it shall receive which indicates
that demolition by neglect is or may be occurring in any landmark or
Landmark District. In the event that the Commission finds that such
demolition is or may be taking place, it shall direct a letter to the
Building Department to notify the owner or person in charge of this
finding, stating the reasons therefor and requesting that the owner or
person in charge immediately take appropriate steps to cause such
demolition to cease, and to confer with the Commission in connection
therewith. Should the owner or person in charge fail to satisfy the
Commission that all necessary steps are or will be promptly taken, the
Commission shall request the Building Department to notify the
Corporation Counsel of the City of Kingston and request the
consideration of the proceedings pursuant to § 405-52D hereof.

B. No owner or person with an interest in real property designated as a
landmark or included within a historic district shall permit the property
to fall into a serious state of disrepair so as to result in the deterioration
of any exterior architectural feature which would, in the judgment of
the Historic Landmarks Preservation Commission, produce a

ventilated to minimize deterioration.

building permit issued under this article shall conform to any
requirements included therein. In the event that the Commission finds
that work is not being performed pursuant to said preservation notice
of action or building permit, it shall notify the owner or person in
charge of this building, stating the reasons therefor and requesting that
the owner or person in charge immediately take appropriate steps to
conform to said preservation notice of action or building permit and to
confer with the Commission in connection therewith. Should the owner
or person in charge fail to satisfy the Commission that all necessary
steps are or will be immediately taken, the Commission shall request
the Building Department to take appropriate action.
B. Similarly, should both a preservation notice of action and a building
permit be issued, the Building Safety Officer shall have all powers
conferred upon him pursuant to the Zoning Ordinance to enforce the
preservation notice of action, including, but not limited to, stop-work
orders.

specified time to serve as jurors. The Court may, by rule, provide that a

No execution shall issue out of the Court after a transcript of the judgment
has been issued.
§ A406-27. Appeals.

the judgment is for the plaintiff in an action to establish a mechanic's

lien, he must enter in the docket the particulars of the judgment as
stated in the transcript.
D. Upon the docketing of a judgment as prescribed in § A406-25B, it shall
be deemed a judgment of the County Court and may be enforced

execution thereof.

in this section, or of a further appeal to the Appellate Division, as
provided in Article 40 of the Civil Practice Act, a certified copy of the
order of the Appellate Court, with the original case or papers upon
which the appeal was heard, shall be transmitted to the Clerk of the
City Court, and the judgment, if any, rendered or directed pursuant to
such order shall be entered by such Clerk.
A. "Small claims" defined. As used in this section, "small claims" shall
mean and include any claim or cause of action or counterclaim within
the jurisdiction of this Court except summary proceedings for the
recovery of real property, where the amount claimed by the plaintiff or
claimant or defendant or the value of the property affected or of the
right claimed does not exceed $150, exclusive of interest and costs.
[Amended by L. 1962; Ch. 226]
B. Small claims procedure, generally. The Court may, by rules, regulate
the practice and procedure controlling the determination of small
claims and prescribe and furnish the forms for instituting them. They
shall constitute a simple, informal and inexpensive procedure for the
prompt determination of such claims so as to do substantial justice
between the parties, in accordance with the rules and principles of
substantive law. The provisions of the Civil Practice Act, the Rules of
Civil Practice and this act shall apply to claims brought under this
section; so far as the same can be made applicable and are not in
conflict, the provisions of this section shall control. Nothing contained
in this section, however, shall be construed to render inapplicable
statutory provisions relating to privileged communications and the
provisions of § 347 of the Civil Practice Act.
§ A406-27 KINGSTON CITY CODE § A406-28
A406:1174
C. Commencement of action. Small claims shall be commenced upon
payment by the claimant of a filing of $1.25, without the service of a
summons and, except by special order of the Court, without the service
of any pleading other than a statement of his cause of action by the
claimant or someone in his behalf to the Clerk, who shall reduce the
same to a concise, written form and record it in a docket kept for such
purpose. A notice of such claim and of the time set for the hearing
thereof shall be sent to the person complained against by registered
mail, with return receipt requested. The cost of sending such notice
shall be included in the filing fee hereinbefore specified.
D. Transfer. The Court shall have power to transfer any small claim or
claims to any other part of the Court upon such terms as the rules may
provide, and proceed to hear the same according to the usual practice
and procedure applicable to other parts of the Court.
E. Trial by jury. A person commencing an action upon a small claim under
this section shall be deemed to have waived a trial by jury, but if said
action shall be removed to a regular part of the Court, the plaintiff shall
have the same right to claim a trial by jury as if such action had
originally been begun in such part. Any party to such action, other than
the plaintiff, prior to the day upon which he is notified to appear or
answer, may file in the Court where the action is pending a demand for
a trial by jury and his affidavit that there are issues of fact in the action
requiring such a trial, specifying the same, and stating that such trial is
desired and intended in good faith. Such demand and affidavit shall be
accompanied with the jury fee required by law and an undertaking in
the sum of $50, in such form as may be approved by the rules, payable
to the other party or parties, conditioned upon the payment of any costs
which may be entered against him in said action or any appeal within 30
days after the entry thereof; or, in lieu of said undertaking, the sum of
$50 may be deposited with the Clerk of the Court, and thereupon the
Clerk shall forthwith transmit such original papers or duly attested
copies thereof as may be provided by the rules of the part of the Court
to which the action shall have been transferred and assigned, and such
part may require pleadings in such action as though it had been begun
by the service of a summons, and such action may be considered a
preferred cause of action. In any small claim which may have been
transferred to another part of the Court, the Court may award costs up
to $25 to the plaintiff if he prevails.
F. Review. A person commencing an action upon a small claim under this
section shall be deemed to have waived all right to appeal, except that
either party may appeal on the sole grounds that substantial justice has
not been done between the parties according to the rules and principles
of substantive law.
G. Res judicata. A judgment obtained under this section may be pleaded as
res judicata only as to the amount involved in the particular action and
shall not otherwise be deemed an adjudication of any fact at issue or
found therein in any other action or court.

exceeding $10, upon a motion, including the adjournment of a trial.

and quantity that unusual attention or expense is required to
handle such materials at the sewage-treatment plant.
(9) Any noxious or malodorous gas or substance capable of creating a
public nuisance.
§ A407-105 KINGSTON CITY COURT ACT § A407-106
A406:1225
D. Grease, oil and sand interceptors.
(1) Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Plumbing Inspector, they are necessary for the
proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive
amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand and other harmful
ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for
private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of
a type and capacity approved by the Plumbing Inspector and shall
be so located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection.

necessary, in the opinion of the Plumbing Inspector, the owner shall
provide, at his expense, such preliminary treatment as may be
necessary to do the following: reduce the Biochemical Oxygen Demand
to 300 parts per million and the suspended solids to 350 parts per
million by weight or reduce objectionable characteristics or
constituents to within the maximum limits provided for in Subsection C,
or control the quantities and rates of discharge of such waters or
wastes. Plans, specifications and other pertinent information relating to
proposed preliminary treatment facilities shall be submitted for the
approval of the Plumbing Inspector and of the Water Pollution Control
Commission of the County of Ulster, and no construction of such
facilities shall be commenced until the approvals are obtained in
writing.
F. Where the preliminary treatment facilities are provided for any waters
or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and
effective operation by the owner, at his expense.
G. When required by the Plumbing Inspector, the owner of any property
served by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a
suitable control manhole on the building sewer to facilitate observation,

and wastes to which reference is made in Subsections C and E shall be
determined in accordance with "Standard Methods for the Examination
of Water and Sewage" and shall be determined at the control manhole
provided for in Subsection C or upon suitable samples taken at said
control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest
downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected.
I. No statement contained in this article shall be construed as preventing
any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or
character may be accepted by the city for treatment subject to payment
thereof by the industrial concern.
A. Any person found to be violating any provisions of this chapter except

NOTES:
 1 Minimum depth may be decreased to 100 feet in an RRR District if the average depth
of the lot equals at least 125 feet and may be decreased to 90 feet in the RR District
and R-1 District if the average depth of the lot equals at least 100 feet.
 2 Front yard may be decreased to 25 feet in an RRR District and to 20 feet in an RR
District when the planes of all walls of a building facing the street intersect the street
line at an angle of 25° or more.
 3 One side yard must be a minimum of 27 feet wide in an RRR District, 18 feet in an RR
District and 17 feet in an R-1 District in the case of a dwelling erected without a
garage. In the case of corner lots [all of which are deemed to have two front and two
side but no rear yards], one side yard shall not be less than 30 feet wide in an RRR
District and an RR District and 25 feet in an R-1 District. The other side yard shall not
be less than 15 feet wide, except that in the case of a dwelling erected without a garage
the lesser side shall not be less than 27 feet wide in an RRR District and 18 feet wide in
an RR District.
 4 Minimum aggregate width of both yards of 15 feet.
 5 Rear yard may be reduced, in lots with a depth of less than 100 feet, by one foot for
each 2 1/2 feet by which the depth of the lot is less than 100 feet. In no case shall the
rear yard have a depth of less than 25 feet.
 6 However, where the Board of Appeals finds that the provision of the required off-street
parking space underneath the principal building or in such a way as to enable the roof
thereof to be used as part of the grounds would be impractical, such Board may
authorize the issuance of a special permit allowing accessory garages to cover an
additional 5% of the area of the lot. Garages designed to enable the roof thereof to be
used as part of the grounds shall be exempt from any coverage limitation.
 7 Minimum side yard must be increased to 1/2 the height of the side wall if that
measurement is greater than 12 feet.
 8 Between a principal building, other than a one-family dwelling, and a one-story
accessory building: 20 feet; between any two other buildings: a distance equal to the
average height of such buildings at the points where such buildings are nearest one to
the other.
 9 Minimum front yard must be increased to the equivalent of 1/3 the height of the front
wall is that measurement is greater than 25 feet in the R-6 District and greater than 15
feet in the O-3 District.
 10 This is per dwelling unit of 600 square feet or more.
 11 No side or rear yard is required, but, if provided, they must be at least six feet and if a
rear yard is contiguous to a residential district, it must be at least 10 feet in the C-2 and
C-3 Districts and 30 feet in the M-2 Districts. In an M-2 District no building may be
built within 10 feet of a street line.
 12 Provided that there is sufficient off-street parking approved by the Planning Board.
 13 Minimum side and rear yards must be increased to 70 feet when contiguous to a
residential district boundary.
 14 For nonresidential buildings, the NB District requirements shall apply; for new and
mixed-use buildings, a minimum lot area of 5,000 square feet is required.
 15 The maximum coverage may be increased to 50% with a single-story building.
 16 Minimum side and rear yards must be increased to 30 feet when contiguous to a
residential district boundary.
 17 Any parcel in an R-4, RLC, R-5 or R-6 Residence District may be subdivided for the
sale of townhouses and each part thereof may be sold. Each such subdivision shall be
subject to the Subdivision Regulations of the City of Kingston and the following
special requirements:
(a) Maximum density. The gross density in an R-4 Multiple Residence District or
RLC Residential - Limited Commercial District shall not exceed 14 dwelling units
per acre or 20 dwelling units per acre in an R-5 or R-6 Multiple Residence District.
(b) Minimum lot size. Individual lots shall have a minimum lot area of 1,600 square
feet, a minimum lot width of 14 feet and a minimum lot depth of 80 feet. End units
shall have a minimum side yard of 30 feet.
(c) Common property. All open space and common property shall conform to the
requirements of § 405-35D.
(d) Front and rear yards. Front and rear yards shall meet the minimum requirement for
the respective district, except that up to 1/2 of the unit may have front or rear yards
equal to 75% of the minimum in order to create variety and better design.
 18 See text for incentives to permit additional coverage.
 19 Maximum residential density shall not exceed 75% of allowable floor to area ratio,
not to exceed 17 units per acre.
 20 Along street side.
 21 Along shoreline. See § 405-25F.
 22 Except as required in § 405-25E(1).
 23 For emergency shelters, reference is made to § 405-46.3 for additional requirements
affecting density.
 24 O-3R refers to lot and bulk requirements for residential uses, and O-3B refers to lot and bulk requirements
for business uses.
