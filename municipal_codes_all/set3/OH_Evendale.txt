REFERENCES TO THE OHIO REVISED CODE
EDITOR'S NOTE: This table lists those Ohio Revised Code sections which have
been substantially duplicated by corresponding Code of Ordinance sections.  All
legislative history references to “(ORC xx.xx)” which appear at the end of
sections (or divisions of sections) in the Village's Code of Ordinances have
been listed here.  Example: to determine which section of the Code of
Ordinances is based on ORC 4511.19, scan down this table to the citation for
“4511.19” and examine the entry across from it: in this case, the corresponding
Code of Ordinances section is 434.01, which means that 434.01 (or a part
thereof) is based directly on ORC 4511.19.

If performance during such a period is unsatisfactory, the employee will be
discharged.
      (2)   The first year or any longer period established by ordinance in
which an employee holds any position to which
         she/he has been promoted is a probationary period during which he/she
is required to demonstrate his/her fitness for the position held by actual

behavior or a voluntary termination occurring while disciplinary proceedings
were pending. Provided, that for the purpose of Police and Fire Department's
service in the command structure of those departments, "seniority" will be

or outside activity which is incompatible with their employment by the Village.

      (2)   Work that brings the Village into disrepute;
      (3)   Work that may represent a conflict of interest.
   (b)   Any full-time employee engaged in an occupation or outside activity

(Ord. 97-40.  Passed 4-2-98; Ord. 18-15.  Passed 2-13-18.)
258.036  ETHICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Public employment is an honorable calling. Service in this field
demands a professional rather than occupational philosophy. A desire for
professional status and a devotion to service above self are the motives which
impel public employees to discharge their responsibility in full measure.
   (b)   Public employees do not seek to benefit personally by any confidential
information which has come to them by virtue of their assignment. They are
faithful and loyal to their organization, constantly striving to cooperate with
any employee or resident and promote better relations with all regularly
constituted public agencies and their representatives in matters of mutual
interest and obligation.
   (c)   Rigid adherence to the principles set out above is mandatory for
anyone accepting a position with the Village.

in marital status and birth/adoption. Notification will be made no more than
three working days after the change takes place to enable the updating of an
employee's records.
(Ord. 97-40.  Passed 4-2-98; Ord. 18-15.  Passed 2-13-18.)
258.038  EVALUATIONS
   (a)   Determination of reviewer. In any evaluation of an employee, other
than department heads, the evaluator will be the employee's immediate
supervisor. Department heads will be evaluated by the Mayor with input from
Council. The type of evaluation given will vary from department to department,
as the needs and responsibilities of the position within the departments vary.
   (b)   Evaluations rationale and scheduling.
      (1)   Employees of the Village will receive a written evaluation annually
beginning with their first anniversary of employment. Annual evaluations
provide a mechanism for constructive criticism of an employee's weak areas and
acknowledgment of an employee's strong areas. It is the belief of the Village
that annual evaluations promote good employee relations as well as more
effective completion of assigned duties.
      (2)   Probationary employees may receive evaluations more frequently than
annually, at the discretion of the employee's department head.
   (c)   Performance criteria.
      (1)   All evaluation forms should be standardized within each department.
Standardization aids in preserving the uniformity of evaluations given within
each department and facilitates comparison with prior evaluations of an
employee.
      (2)   The standardized form may be objective or narrative in nature,
depending on the type of position being evaluated. Generally, the objective
type of evaluations are to be used for positions which have quantifiable
responsibilities. Narrative or more subjective evaluations are to be used for
positions which have less tangible, less measurable responsibilities. In both
cases, an overall rating should be given to the employee being evaluated.
      (3)   All new forms and revisions of existing forms must have the
approval of the Mayor.
   (d)   Completion of evaluations. Once an employee of the Village has been
evaluated, the employee must be given the opportunity to respond, in writing,
on the evaluation form. After completion of the response, the form must be
signed by the employee and the completed form must be put in the employee's
file as a matter of record. A copy of the completed form shall be given to the
employee.
(Ord. 97-40.  Passed 4-2-98; Ord. 18-15.  Passed 2-13-18.)
258.039  LAY-OFF.

the number of employees, the Mayor shall determine the departments and the
number of employees which said reduction shall include. Employees shall be laid
off at the time and in the number specified by the Mayor in inverse order of
their relative length and quality of service, the latter as established by
performance ratings. When applicable within each affected class, all
probationary employees shall be laid off before regular employees.

258.096  VACATION LEAVE USE.

   (a)   With the exception of sworn police and fire personnel, when a Village
observed holiday occurs within an employee's vacation period, the employee
shall be entitled to an additional day of vacation leave. (Sworn police and
fire personnel are compensated by the Village in other ways for holidays.)
   (b)   Vacation leave earned at the beginning of each calendar year shall be
scheduled and used during the calendar year in which it is credited to the
employee. It is not cumulative. The Mayor, in the event of hardship, may
approve vacation leave being carried into the next calendar year. An employee
off on sick leave may use earned vacation time in lieu of earned sick leave
only if the sick time is not being used concurrently with FMLA (Appendix H) in
place. Otherwise, vacation time earned but not used in the calendar year
earned, shall be forfeited unless the Mayor has determined that, due to
hardship, earned vacation may be carried over to the next year. An employee on
injured-on-duty status who is being paid 100% of base salary shall not earn or
be paid for vacation for the period of injured-on-duty status. Vacation time
earned prior to going on injured-on-duty status shall be forfeited if not used
by the end of the calendar year unless the Mayor has granted an extension.
   (c)   Vacation leave must be scheduled with the approval of the employee's
supervisor.
   (d)   An employee who resigns without giving at least 14 days prior written
notice will forfeit, on the date of resignation, any earned and unused vacation
leave, or pay in lieu thereof, at the discretion of the Mayor.
   (e)   At the date of the termination of employment by any employee, the
payroll clerk shall prorate the vacation earned to the date of termination. If
the employee has taken any unearned vacation leave, the hours of unearned
vacation leave used shall be deducted from the final pay check. If the employee
has earned unused vacation leave, the hours of earned vacation leave not used
times the employee's hourly rate shall be paid to the employee in the final
paycheck.
   (f)   In extraordinary circumstances, the Mayor may allow vacation leave to
be taken prior to the first of the next calendar year, not to exceed the
vacation time earned. The vacation time used shall be deducted from the
vacation time earned at the beginning of the next year. Should the employee
leave the employment prior to January 1 of the upcoming year, the cost of the
unearned vacation time taken shall be deducted from the final paycheck of the
employee.
   (g)   Upon retirement an employee shall be paid for any earned but unused
vacation pay at the next regular pay date following retirement.

   (c)   Any employee who is eligible for holiday pay is entitled to one
floating holiday in addition to the holidays detailed above. Said floating
holiday shall be scheduled by the employee with the approval of the supervisor
and must be taken in the year in which it is earned. The employee shall be
responsible for scheduling the holiday with the supervisor early enough in the
year to allow for the efficient operation of the employee's department. The
employee's failure to do so may result in the employee not being able to take
the holiday at no penalty to the Village.
   (d)   All part-time employees who work between 1,300 and 1,950 hours per
payroll year are entitled to holiday pay in accordance with the below schedule.

separated from Village employment for any reason before December 26 of the
year, that employee shall reimburse the Village for the use of any such time
that exceeds ten hours multiplied by the number of Village observed holidays
that have actually taken place during that calendar year. The Payroll Clerk
shall deduct the amount of holiday equivalent time owed from the employee's
last paycheck.
   (c)   Use of holiday equivalent time by police officers.

12 week FMLA (Appendix H) leave entitlement concurrently with sick time used.
   (f)   Failure to turn in the necessary sick leave reports or written report
as required from a doctor or hospital, will result in the person losing one
day's pay for each sick day off, due to unexcused absence from duty. All

back to work.
   (g)   Falsification and/or abuse of a sick leave report will result in

      (1)   The approval of the Mayor, based upon written recommendation by the
injured employee's department head and a qualified healthcare physician of the
Village's choosing. Such physician may include the employee's treating
physician. Pending such approval, the injured employee's time off shall be
deducted from their accumulated sick leave. It shall be restored to his/her
credit upon verification by the Mayor that on duty injury leave is approved.
Interactive process - The injured employee shall meet with the department head
to identify precise work limitations, if any, resulting from injury as
determined by the physician. Should the employee have restrictions or have
sustained a disability as a result of the injury, the department head will work
with the employee to determine what, if any, potential reasonable
accommodations could be implemented by the Village to enable the employee to
return to work, either in their usual and customary position or in some other
type of work;
      (2)   All injured employees must file a claim with the State of Ohio
Bureau of Worker's Compensation (Appendix I).  Should the claimant qualify to
receive and accepts lost wages from the Bureau, the claimant must assign any
funds received as lost wages to the Village Finance Department while receiving
injury leave pay. Injury leave pay shall be at the employee's regular base
salary or pay rate;
      (3)   The Mayor, in consultation with a competent physician of the
Village's choosing and the injured employee's department head, shall have the
right to extend injury leave;
      (4)   Before an employee may return from injury leave to assume the
duties and responsibilities of his/her regular position, the Village shall
require written verification from a competent physician of the Village's
choosing confirming the employees' ability to perform his/her regular job
duties and responsibilities without endangering themselves or others;
      (5)   Time off for the purpose of medical examinations or treatments
resulting from injury on the job shall be considered injury leave;
      (6)   The provisions of this policy shall not apply to intentional, self-
inflicted injury, injuries incurred as a result of activities not consistent
with an employee's normal work duties or responsibilities, gross negligence by
the employee, or in situations conflicting with the laws of the State of Ohio
or rules and regulations set forth by the Ohio Bureau of Worker's Compensation
(Appendix I). In the event a person is off duty on sick leave or injury leave,
that person shall not be eligible for overtime pay during such period.
   (b)   Temporary modified duty.
      (1)   The purpose is to describe the procedure for assigning employees to
temporary modified duty within their department when injuries sustained during
work-related occupational or non-occupational (not work related) activities
result in physical limitations as diagnosed by a qualified health care
professional.
      (2)   It is the policy of the Village to assist injured employees in
returning to work as soon as they are medically able to perform meaningful, job
related work. Temporary, modified duty assignments may be offered at the sole
discretion of a department head with consent of the Mayor on a case by case
basis. Temporary modified duty assignments are not permanent assignments nor do
they result in permanent or new job positions, nor do they set a precedent for
future, if any, temporary assignments.
      (3)   A department head's ability to offer an employee a temporary
modified duty assignment will be based on the limitations of the employee and
department needs, and will generally not exceed three months. The process for
evaluating an employee for a modified duty assignment, shall be as follows:
         A.   The employee's treating health care professional must provide the
employee with written clearance stating that the employee is able to work
modified duty but with identified work restrictions. Such clearance
documentation shall be provided to the employee's department head as soon as
practicable;
         B.   The department head should evaluate whether or not there is
sufficient work in their department that can be done within the work
restrictions established by the employee's treating health care professional.
If the department head determines that such work is available, the department
head may then contact the Mayor or the authorized designee to request a
temporary modified duty assignment that is commensurate with the employee's
work restrictions. There may be instances when a temporary modified duty
assignment within the employee's work restrictions is not available;
         C.   If a temporary modified duty assignment is available, the
employee may be required to schedule an appointment with a qualified health
care physician of the Village's choosing for final medical clearance before
reporting for duty;
         D.   Extensions of a temporary modified duty assignment may be granted
on a case-by-case basis at the sole discretion of the department head with
consent of the Mayor. Extensions are not guaranteed. An authorized extension
will not expand any temporary modified duty into a permanent assignment and
will not be considered as precedent for other extensions. If granted,
extensions will be evaluated on a month-to-month basis but can be terminated
sooner if/when the employee is either able to return to full duty or the
department head determines there is no longer sufficient temporary work;
         E.   For employees who are determined to be partially or fully
disabled, as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Village
will comply with the ADA and/or any Ohio laws against discrimination in
determining what, if any, reasonable accommodations can be made to enable a
partially or fully disabled employee to work on a temporary, modified duty
assignment;
         F.   While the level of responsibility of the tasks performed may
change for an employee working on a temporary modified duty assignment, payment
of wages will remain at the same rate as the employee was receiving before the
assignment;
         G.   No more than two employees per department may be assigned to
temporary modified duty assignments at any given time unless approved by the
Mayor;
         H.   If temporary modified work assignments are available,
consideration for assignments will first be given to employees who have
suffered work-related injuries;
         I.   The provisions of this policy shall not apply in situations
conflicting with the laws of the State of Ohio or rules and regulations set
forth by the Ohio Bureau of Worker's Compensation (Appendix I).
      (3)   It is the employee's responsibility to immediately inform the
department head of an absence from work and to advise when they believe they
will be medically released to return to work, with or without restrictions. The
employee shall provide advance notice of his/her potential return to work and
shall provide written medical verification of the clearance and any
restrictions.
   (c)   Return to full duty.  If an employee has restrictions prescribed by a
qualified health care professional, the department head will evaluate the
employee's request to return to full duty work and the written medical
verification, and will consult with administration in order to make a
determination whether:
      (1)   The employee may return to full duty;
      (2)   The employee may return to work to a temporary modified-duty
assignment based on whether the department has a need for temporary work
assignments that may be accomplished considering the employee's restrictions.
These assignments may be offered at the sole discretion of a department head
with consent of the Mayor on a case-by-case basis. Temporary modified duty
assignments are not permanent assignments, nor do they result in permanent or
new job positions, nor do they set a precedent for future, if any, temporary
assignments;
      (3)   The employee should have a fitness-for-duty evaluation;
      (4)   The employee has reached a permanent and stationary rating and it
is necessary to engage in an interactive process to determine a reasonable
accommodation.
   (d)   It is the responsibility of the employee to ensure they are not
performing work that violates any restriction. If the employee believes they
have been requested or directed to perform work that violates the restrictions,
the employee should, prior to following the request/direction, make a prompt
report to the department head or, in the event the request/direction is from
the department head, to the Director of Administrative Services. The department
head or Director of Administrative Services will then work with the employee to
resolve any misunderstandings or discrepancies between the requested/directed
work assignment and the ability or inability to perform such work assignment
within the healthcare professionals prescribed limitations.
   (e)   Department heads shall inform the Mayor of all circumstances when an
employee's injury, on or off the job, affects their ability to return to work.
From time to time as needed, department heads and/or the Director of
Administrative Services shall keep the Mayor informed of the status of injured,
recovering employees and shall seek the Mayor's consent on decisions or actions
when required by this policy.

258.123  CIVIL LEAVE.
   (a)   Any full-time employee who is serving as a juror shall be paid regular
pay for any time missed from work. Compensation paid for jury service or as a
witness fee may be retained by the Village employee so long as the individual
reports to work upon release from jury service on a scheduled work day.
   (b)   A Village employee retained as an expert witness to testify in a
matter unrelated to Village business shall do so on his/her own time and shall
not be paid by the Village for time spent in preparing or presenting expert
testimony, even though it may be pursuant to a subpoena. Civil leave shall not
be granted for appearing in court or before a board or commission on personal
matters. The Mayor or designee shall make the final decision on the application
of this paragraph.
   (c)   Police and Fire Department personnel subpoenaed into court relative to
matters which they investigated in the normal course of their duties shall be
considered to be subpoenaed on matters relating to Village business.
   (d)   An employee may be given time off without pay not to exceed one hour
at the discretion of the employee's department head, for the purpose of voting
in a general election.

258.124  NONPAID LEAVE OF ABSENCE.
   A regular employee may be granted by the Mayor a leave of absence, without
pay, for a period not to exceed 12 calendar months. Such leave may be granted
for advanced study, or other purposes which will serve the interest of the
Village. While on such leave, the employee may, at the discretion of the Mayor,
purchase health and life insurance coverage through the Village at its group
rate. When an employee returns from a leave of absence, the employee will be
returned to a position in the classification they held with the same rate of
pay at the time the leave became effective.
(Ord. 97-40.  Passed 4-2-98; Ord. 18-15.  Passed 2-13-18.)
258.125   BEREAVEMENT LEAVE.
   In the event of death in the family, a 37½ hour, 40-hour or Police
Department employee will be granted a paid leave of absence up to three working
days, and a firefighter will be granted a paid leave of absence of one 24-hour
workday. In the event the funeral is to be held outside of a 200-mile radius of
the Village, bereavement leave shall be extended up to five days (two 24-hour
days for a firefighter). Any extension beyond those periods shall be deducted
from an employee's sick leave. The employee shall give prior notification to
the department head or designee that the bereavement leave is requested. Each
bereavement leave shall be considered a separate event.
(Ord. 04-70.  Passed 12-9-04; Ord. 18-15.  Passed 2-13-18.)
258.126   FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE (FMLA) (Appendix H).
   (a)   Purpose.  To provide general guidance for managing unpaid leave for
eligible employees for qualified medical and family reasons, including:
      (1)   The birth or placement of a child for adoption or foster care;
      (2)   To care for an immediate family member (spouse, child or parent)
with a serious health condition;
      (3)   When an employee is unable to work because of his/her own serious
health condition;
      (4)   To care for a spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin who is a
service member of the United States Armed Forces and who has a serious injury
or illness incurred in the line of duty.
   (b)   This policy does not address all possible situations and circumstances
that may arise when an employee requests unpaid leave for family or medical
reasons. As these unpaid leave situations arise, department heads should
consult with the administration or legal counsel to obtain specific guidance
regarding unpaid leave rights and obligations.
   (c)   Definitions.
      (1)   "Child."  A child under 18 years of age, or 18 years of age or
older who is incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability.
An employee's child is one for whom the employee has actual day-to-day
responsibility for care and includes a biological, adopted or foster child;
stepchild; or a child for whom the employee is standing in loco parentis (in
place of a parent).
      (2)   "FMLA."  The Federal Family and Medical Leave Act.
      (3)   "Qualified health care professional."  A physician, surgeon, doctor
of osteopathy, podiatrist, dentist, psychologist, optometrist, nurse
practitioner, nurse midwife, clinical social worker or physician assistant duly
licensed and authorized to practice medicine; chiropractors for some purposes;
any health care provider from whom the department benefits plan will accept
certification of the existence of a serious health condition to substantiate a
claim for benefits.
      (4)   "Spouse."  The person with whom an employee has entered into a
marriage defined or recognized by the location in which the marriage was
entered into.
   (d)   Eligible employee.  Employees are eligible for FMLA after working for
the Village for at least one year and completing 1,250 hours over the 12 months
prior to the commencement of the unpaid leave.
   (e)   Type and duration of leave. Eligible employees are entitled under FMLA
to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave during a 12-month period. Up to 26 weeks of
unpaid leave during a single 12-month period may be available to care for
certain injured military service members. The 12-month period is measured
backward from the date leave is taken and continuously with each additional
leave day taken.
      (1)   Serious health condition: Eligible employees may take up to 12
weeks of unpaid leave to care for a spouse, child or parent with a serious
health condition or when the employee is unable to work because of his/her own
serious health condition. If both spouses are employed by the Village, the
combined number of work weeks to care for a sick parent is limited to 12 work
weeks during any 12-month period. Generally, a serious health condition is an
illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves:
         A.   An overnight stay in a hospital, hospice or residential medical
care facility;
         B.   Continuing treatment by a qualified health care professional due
to a serious health condition of more than three full consecutive calendar
days;
         C.   Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy complications or
prenatal care;
         D.   A chronic condition which requires treatment;
         E.   A permanent condition for which treatment may not be effective
(such as Alzheimer's or the terminal stages of a disease);
         F.   Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments, including
any recovery period, either for restorative surgery after an accident or other
injury, or for a condition that would likely result in a period of incapacity
of more than three consecutive calendar days without medical intervention or
treatment (such as cancer chemotherapy or physical therapy for arthritis).
      (2)   Birth or placement of child: Eligible employees make take up to 12
weeks of unpaid leave for the birth of a son or daughter or placement of a son
or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care. The unpaid leave
must be concluded within one year of the birth or placement of the child. If
both parents are employed by the Village, the combined number of work weeks of
unpaid leave is limited to 12 work weeks during any 12-month period.
      (3)   Military exigency leave: Eligible employees may take service member
leave of up to 12 weeks for qualifying exigencies occurring because a spouse,
child or parent is on covered active duty or has been notified of an impending
order to active duty. This type of leave is available to a family member of a
person in the National Guard, Reserves or members of the regular Armed Forces
deployed to a foreign country. Qualifying exigencies include:
         A.   Addressing issues that arise from a short notice (seven or less
days) deployment;
         B.   Attending military events related to the active duty or call to
duty;
         C.   Attending family support or assistance programs;
         D.   Making child care or educational arrangements or attending school
activities arising from active duty or a call to active duty;
         E.   Making financial and legal arrangements;
         F.   Spending time with a military member who is on short-term rest-
and-recuperation leave during a period of deployment;
         G.   Attending post-deployment activities;
         H.   Addressing issues that arise from the death of a military member,
such as making funeral arrangements;
         I.   Caring for a military employee's parent who is incapable of self-
care, such as providing care on an immediate need basis or arranging for
alternative care.
      (4)   Military caregiver leave: Eligible employees may take up to 26
weeks of unpaid leave in a single 12-month period to care for a spouse, son,
daughter, parent or next of kin (as defined in Section 258.125) who has
incurred an injury or illness in the line of duty while on active duty in the
Armed Forces, provided that such injury or illness may render the family member
medically unfit to perform work.
            Military caregiver unpaid leave is also available to family members
of covered veterans who were members of the Armed Forces, including the
National Guard or Reserves, at any point in the five years preceding the date
on which the veteran undergoes medical treatment, recuperation or therapy.
            During the single 12-month period, employees are entitled to no
more than a combined total of 26 weeks of FMLA unpaid leave. In any case in
which a husband and wife are both employed by the Village, the combined number
of work weeks of unpaid leave is limited to 26 work weeks during any 12-month
period.
            Service member FMLA unpaid leave runs concurrent with other leave
entitlements provided under Federal, State and local law. Where FMLA unpaid
leave qualifies as both military caregiver leave and care for a family member
with a serious health condition, the unpaid leave will be designated as
military caregiver leave first.
      (5)   Family military leave: An eligible employee who is the parent,
spouse, or who has or had legal custody of a member of the uniformed services
who is called to active duty for more than 30 days, or who is injured, wounded
or hospitalized during active service, is entitled to ten days or 80 hours of
unpaid leave, whichever is less, with continued benefits.
      (6)   Intermittent leave: An employee may take unpaid leave for the
employee's own serious health condition, for the serious health condition of
the employee's spouse, child or parent, or to care for a covered service member
with a serious injury or illness, intermittently or on a reduced schedule if
medically necessary and if that medical need can best be accommodated by an
intermittent schedule as defined in Federal law. Unpaid leave due to a military
exigency may be taken on an intermittent or reduced-leave schedule.
            Intermittent unpaid leave for the birth or placement of a child is
only available if granted at the discretion of the department head unless the
employee has a serious health condition in connection with the birth or if the
newborn child has a serious health condition. Intermittent unpaid leave for any
employee shall be tracked and calculated.
   (f)   Employee benefits while on unpaid leave. While on unpaid leave,
employees will continue to be covered by any group health insurance to the same
extent that coverage is provided while the employee is on the job. However,
employees will not continue to be covered under non-health benefit plans.
Employees are responsible for any health plan employee contributions while on
unpaid leave. Employee contribution rates are subject to any change in rates
that occurs while the employee is on unpaid leave. If an employee fails to
return to work after his/her unpaid leave entitlement has been exhausted or
expires, the Village may recover its share of health plan premiums for the
entire unpaid leave period unless the employee does not return because of the
continuation, recurrence or onset of a serious health condition of the employee
or his/her family member that would entitle the employee to unpaid leave, or
because of circumstances beyond the employee's control. The Village may recover
premiums through deduction from any sums (e.g., unpaid wages, vacation pay).
Employees may not earn additional time off while on unpaid leave.
   (g)   Substitution of paid accrued leaves. Employees are required to exhaust
all applicable paid leave before taking unpaid leave. Paid accrued leave
includes vacation leave, sick leave, personal leave and compensatory time
earned in lieu of overtime, pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act (Appendix
C) during FMLA leave. Employees may not use paid accrued leave to extend FMLA
leave beyond 12 work weeks per year.
   (h)   Use of sick leave. Employees are required to first exhaust paid sick
leave concurrently with FMLA leave.
   (i)   Use of FMLA leave. If an employee takes a leave of absence for any
reason that is FMLA qualifying, the Village may designate that non-FMLA leave
as running concurrently with the employee's 12-week FMLA unpaid leave
entitlement.
   (j)   Procedures. The following procedures will apply for all employees
requesting leave under FMLA:
      (1)   When a leave is requested for a medical or other FMLA-related
treatment appointment, the employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule
the appointment at a time that minimizes disruption to the department's
operations;
      (2)   An employee who wishes to take FMLA must provide his/her supervisor
with 30 days' advanced notice when the leave is foreseeable or as soon as
practicable if the need for leave is not foreseeable;
      (3)   At the time of the request, the employee must complete a FMLA
request form;
   Requests for medical leave shall be accompanied by a qualified health care
professional statement, including the date on which the serious health
condition began and the estimated date of return to work. Once the leave is
requested or designated by the Village, the department head should forward the
request and any medical certifications to the administration and ensure the
employee is provided the necessary forms and FMLA information within five.
Employees are required to provide medical certification of a qualified health
care professional or military documentation, if requested. Employees shall be
required to periodically report on their status and intent to return to work.
This may assist in avoiding a delay in reinstatement when the employee is ready
to return to work. Employees returning from a medical leave will be required to
present medical verification from a qualified health care professional of the
employee's ability to return to work and a list of any restrictions that need
to be accommodated.
   (j)   Reinstatement following leave.  Employees returning from FMLA within
the qualified period will be restored to their original job or to an equivalent
job with equivalent pay and benefits (but not seniority), unless the employee
would not otherwise have been employed at the time reinstatement is requested
(e.g., in the case of a layoff).
   If the same position is no longer available, such as in a layoff, the
employee will be entitled to a position that is comparable in pay, job content
and
promotional opportunities and geographic location, if such a comparable
position exists.
   If upon return from leave an employee is unable to perform the essential
functions of the job because of a physical or mental disability, the supervisor
should work with the administration or legal counsel to engage in an
interactive process with the employee to identify a potential reasonable
accommodation.
   After exhausting paid leave, unpaid FMLA leave will continue until the
conclusion of the protected 12- or 26-week time limit. Following the FMLA
unpaid protected leave, the department head, in consultation with the legal
counsel and the administration, will determine whether non-FMLA leave should
apply.
   (k)   Responsibility. Department heads should work with the administration
and legal counsel regarding questions relating to leave or reinstatement from
leave under this policy. The administration should advise the department head
and inform members of their rights and responsibilities.
   (l)   Records. Leave-related records will be preserved in compliance with
the Village records retention schedule. Records and documents related to doctor
certifications and other medical information created for purposes of complying
with FMLA and this policy shall be maintained as confidential medical records
in separate files from employee personnel files.
(Ord. 18-15.  Passed 2-13-18.)
258.127   DONATING ACCRUED LEAVE.
   The Mayor of the Village of Evendale is authorized to promulgate a Leave
Donation Policy allowing employees to voluntarily donate a limited amount of
accrued leave to another Village employee who, because of extraordinary
circumstances, has insufficient leave time available to allow for the
recuperation from an illness or injury of him or herself or an immediate family
member. Such Policy may be made retroactive to July 15, 2019. Such Policy may
be changed from time to time by the Mayor. When adopted or changed said Policy
shall be distributed to all Village employees.

undermines the integrity of Evendale Village Government.
(Ord. 97-40.  Passed 4-2-98; Ord. 18-15.  Passed 2-13-18.)
258.141  DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING.
   (a)   (1)   Evendale is concerned with the health and well-being of all
employees. The Village cannot and will not condone or tolerate substance use
and/or abuse, such as:
         A.   Use of illegal drugs;
         B.   Misuse of alcohol;
         C.   Sale, purchase, transfer, use or possession of any illegal drugs;
         D.   Arrival or return to work under the influence of any drug (legal
or illegal) or alcohol;
         E.   Misuse of prescription or over-the-counter medications.
      (2)   Evendale's Drug-Free Workplace Program establishes clear guidelines
for acceptable and unacceptable employee behavior.
      (3)   The Village holds employees accountable for substance abuse but
also supports getting help for employees who come forward voluntarily to
identify that they have a substance problem. If they do so prior to being
involved in a substance abuse related incident, they may receive assistance
from the Village.
      (4)   Employees with substance abuse problems may be offered a "second
chance/last chance" agreement, provided they seek treatment and recovery. The
terms and conditions of an agreement are based on factors such as quality of
job performance, circumstances of the event, length of service and/or other
related factors.
      (5)   The Village's Drug-Free Workplace Program consists of:
         A.   Annual substance awareness education for all employees;
         B.   Annual training for supervisors regarding their responsibilities;
         C.   Routine and random drug and alcohol testing;
         D.   Employee assistance (CONCERN or similar EAP).
      (6)   Employees will receive information about substance use as a
workplace problem, signs, symptoms and dangers associated with drug or alcohol
use, and how and where to get help for themselves and their families.
Evendale's Director of Administrative Services will be the Village's Drug-Free
Workplace Administrator. The Administrator will be responsible for arranging
drug and alcohol testing, identifying resources for help, and arranging for
qualified people to help with employee awareness education and with supervisor
training.
   (b)   Program protections.  The Drug-Free Workplace Policy is designed to
protect employees from the behaviors of substance users. Some of the
protections built into the program are:
      (1)   Records such as drug/alcohol testing results and referrals for
assistance are not subject to public disclosure and are therefore kept
confidential in accordance with the Ohio Public Records (Appendix D)
requirements;
      (2)   Employee records, such as testing results and referrals for help,
will be maintained in accordance with Ohio Public Records law (Appendix D). Any
violation of confidentiality rights is subject to disciplinary action up to and
including termination of employment;
      (3)   Testing will be done through a local Ohio Bureau of Workers
Compensation (OBWC) (Appendix I) certified laboratory. The lab will have a
Medical Review Officer (MRO), a trained physician responsible for validating
the presence and purpose for drugs in an employee's system;
      (4)   If the initial results exceed the cut off levels established by the
Federal guidelines, then a second test will be administered;
      (5)   Cut-off levels are used to determine when employees with a certain
drug or alcohol in their system is considered a positive test;
      (6)   A violation of this policy will be reported to law enforcement for
investigation to determine breach of criminal law.
   (c)   Employee awareness education.  Every employee will be required to
attend drug-free workplace program training. There will be an opportunity to
ask questions. The written policy will be shared and employees are expected to
sign for receipt. A minimum of one hour of educational training annually will
be provided to all employees.
   (d)   Supervisor training.  Supervisors will be trained to recognize
substance problems which endanger employees or others, as well as problems
which are a violation of this policy. This one hour training is in addition to
annual employee education. Supervisors will be trained in testing
responsibilities, how to recognize behaviors that demonstrate an alcohol/drug
problem and how to make referrals for help.
   (e)   Drug and alcohol testing.
      (1)   Testing is intended to detect problems, deter usage, and allow
appropriate corrective action. The Village adheres to the testing protocols and
drug screen standards as determined by the Ohio Bureau of Workers Compensation
(Appendix I).
      (2)   The Village reserves the right to test for any substance whether
legal or illegal when there is a suspicion of abuse.
   (f)   Employee assistance.  The Village provides a substance abuse program
by contract through a third party administrator (i.e. CONCERN). When it is
determined that an employee has a substance problem, the Director of
Administrative Services will meet with the person to discuss the problem. To
continue employment, the employee must agree to an assessment and prescribed
testing to determine the extent of the problem. The employee will be required
to fully cooperate with the testing and treatment, and will be expected not to
violate this policy. The Village reserves the right to terminate employment
based on a positive test, failure to cooperate in the program or for violating
this policy.

applicants for full-time positions and employees will be tested for the
presence of drugs and alcohol in their breath, blood or urine under the

a part of the Village's employment procedures, all applicants for full-time
positions will be required to undergo a post-offer, pre-employment medical
examination and a drug screen/test that is conducted by a contractor designated
by the Village. Any offer of employment is contingent upon, among other things,
satisfactory completion of this examination and/or screening, and the
determination by the Village and its examining physician that the applicant is
capable of performing the responsibilities of the position that has been
offered.
      (2)   Reasonable suspicion testing. Reasonable suspicion testing will
occur when Village management and/or supervision has reason to suspect that an
employee may be in violation of the policy. The suspicion must be documented in
writing within 24 hours of the event or prior to the release of the test
findings. Reasonable suspicion testing may be based upon, among other things:
         A.   Observed behavior, such as direct observation of drug/alcohol use
or possession and/or the physical symptoms of drug and/or alcohol use;
         B.   A pattern of abnormal conduct or erratic behavior;
         C.   Arrest or conviction for a drug-related offense, or the
identification of an employee as the focus of a criminal investigation into

notification to the Village, within five working days, of any drug-related
arrest;
         D.   Information provided either by reliable and credible sources or
independently corroborated, regarding an employee's substance use;
         E.   Newly discovered evidence that the employee has tampered with a
previous drug or alcohol test.
         Reasonable suspicion testing does not require certainty. All
supervisors will be trained in the recognition of drug and alcohol-related
signs and symptoms. Testing may be for drugs or alcohol or both.
      (3)   Post-accident testing.
         A.   Post-accident testing will be conducted whenever an accident
occurs as defined below. For purposes of this policy, an "accident" is
considered an unplanned, unexpected or unintended event that occurs on Village
property during the conduct of the Village's business, or during working hours,
or which involves Village-supplied motor vehicles or motor vehicles that are

which results in any of the following:
            1.   A fatality of anyone involved in the accident;
            2.   Bodily injury to the employee and/or another person that
requires off-site medical attention away from the Village's place of
employment;
            3.   Vehicular damage whereas the damage causes the vehicle to be
incapacitated and requires removal by a tow truck; or
            4.   Any accident requiring medical attention from a physician.
         B.   When such an accident results in one of the previously described
situations, any employee who contributed to the accident will be tested.
      (4)   Drug and/or alcohol testing after an accident. Drug testing will be
performed within 32 hours of the incident. Alcohol testing will be performed
within eight hours of the incident. Employees expressly grant to the Village
the right to obtain specimens for drug and alcohol testing by medical
personnel. Further, all employees expressly grant unto the Village, its
officers and management, access to any and all other medical information that
may be relevant in conducting a complete and thorough investigation of the
employment-related accident.
      (5)   Random testing. Unannounced random testing will occur periodically
for all employees.
         A.   In conformance with Federal law, the following specifically
applies to Service Department employees. Should any equipment operator or
foreman of the Service Department have their CDL license suspended for any
reason, such suspension shall be disciplined as provided in Section
258.160.
         B.   Should any employee fail a drug or alcohol test, refuse to submit
to a drug or alcohol test, or tamper or falsify a drug or alcohol test
administered under provisions of this section, the employee shall be
disciplined as provided in Section
258.160.
      (6)   Follow-up testing and procedures after a positive first test.
Employees who test positive for drug or alcohol may be offered a "last-chance"
agreement. The terms and conditions of a "last-chance" agreement include but
are not limited to the following:
         A.   The employee is required to take a second drug and/or alcohol
test ("return-to-duty" test) before the employee is allowed to return to work.
Employees who pass the second drug and/or alcohol test will be required to
submit to four or more additional tests over a period of at least one year
proceeding the second test;

chance" agreement timeframe will be terminated.
      (7)   Mandatory testing. Police and fire personnel are drug tested with
annual physicals.
   (h)   Employee's rights upon positive test result.  An employee who tests
positive under this policy will be given an opportunity to explain the findings
to the MRO prior to the issuance of a positive test result to the Village. The
MRO can request information on recent medical history and on medications taken
within the last 30 days by the employee. The employee may be asked to provide
documentary evidence (for example, the names of treating physicians, pharmacies
where prescriptions have been filled, etc.). A failure on the part of the
employee to provide such documentary evidence will result in the issuance of a
positive report by the MRO with no attendant medical explanation.
   (i)   Reporting of results.  All test results will be reported to the MRO
prior to the results being issued to the Village. The MRO will receive from the
testing laboratory a detailed report of the findings of the specimen. Each
substance tested for will be listed along with the results of the testing. The
Village will receive a summary report, and this report will indicate whether
the employee passed or failed the test. All procedures are to be consistent
with the most current guidelines for Medical Review Officers, published by the
Federal DHHS.
   (j)   Storage of test results and right to review test results.  All records
of drug/alcohol testing will be stored separately from the employee's general
personnel documents. These records shall be maintained as prescribed by Ohio
Public Records Law (Appendix D). Access is limited to designated Village
officials. The information contained in these files shall be utilized to
properly administer this policy and to provide to certifying agencies for
review as may be required by law. Village officials who have access to these
records are charged with maintaining record confidentiality. Any breach of
confidentiality with regard to these records may be an offense resulting in
disciplinary action. Any employee tested under this policy has the right to
review and/or receive a copy of the respective test results. An employee may
request from the Drug-Free Workplace Program Administrator, in writing a copy
of the test results.

citizens on social media sites, website, Blog, or other similar internet forum
of communication to the degree that their speech does not impair working
relationships in the Village for which confidentiality is important; does not
impede the performance of duties, impair discipline and harmony among
coworkers, or negatively affect the public perception of the Village;
         B.   As public employees, Village personnel are cautioned that speech
on or off duty, made pursuant to their official duties, that owes its existence
to the employee's professional duties and responsibilities, is not protected
speech under the First Amendment and may form the basis for discipline if
deemed detrimental to the Village. Village personnel should assume that their
speech and related activity on social media sites will reflect upon their
office and the Village;
         C.   Village personnel shall not post, transmit , or otherwise
disseminate any information, including photos, documents, etc., to which they

violent, offensive, harassing, or pornographic in nature along with any
reference to the employer or individual's employment.
         E.   For safety and security reasons, Village personnel are cautioned
not to disclose their employment with the Village nor shall they post
information pertaining to any other member of the department without his/her
permission. As such, Village personnel are cautioned not to do the following:
            •   Display department logos, uniforms, or similar identifying
items on personal web pages;
            •   Post personal photographs or provide similar means of personal
recognition that may cause them to be identified as a police officer of this
department. Officers who are, or who may reasonably be expected to work in
undercover operations, are cautioned to not post any form of visual or personal
identification.
         F.   When using social media, Village personnel should be mindful that
their speech becomes part of the worldwide electronic domain. Therefore,
Village personnel should be mindful of the standards imposed by the
department's code of conduct prior to engaging in any social media, which could
be construed as reflecting poorly on department personnel or the Village. In
particular, Village personnel should be aware of the standards created by the
Village code of conduct with regard to the following:
            •   Speech containing obscene or sexually explicit language,
images, or acts and statements or other forms of speech that ridicule, malign,
disparage, or otherwise
               express bias against any race, any religion, or any protected
class of individuals;
            •   Speech involving themselves or other Village personnel
reflecting behavior that would reasonably be considered reckless or
irresponsible.
         G.   Engaging in prohibited speech noted herein, may provide grounds
for undermining or impeaching an officer's testimony in criminal proceedings.
Where applicable, Village personnel thus sanctioned are subject to discipline
up to and including termination.
         H.   Village personnel may not divulge information gained by reason of
their Village authority; make any statements, speeches, appearances, and
endorsements; or publish materials that could reasonably be considered to
represent the views or positions of this Village without approval from a
department head, Council or Mayor.

litigation for:
      (1)   Publishing or posting false information that harms the reputation
of another person, group or organization (defamation);
      (2)   Publishing or posting private facts and personal information about
someone without their permission that has not been previously revealed to the
public, is not of legitimate public concern, and would be offensive to a
reasonable person;
      (3)   Using someone else's name, likeness, or other personal attributes
without that person's permission for an exploitative purpose; or
      (4)   Publishing the creative work of another, trademarks, or certain

and the vendor is reputable. Departments may implement other security measures,
as they deem necessary.
   (d)   Credit limits and restrictions.
      (1)   The Chief Fiscal and Accounting Officer is responsible to set card
limits and restrictions and to monitor usage of all credit cards issued to
Village employees. Card limits are set at $2,500/month; however; the limits are
reviewed and adjusted up or down at the Chief Fiscal and Accounting Officer's
discretion. The Chief Fiscal and Accounting Officer aspires to limit credit
risk exposure.  An employee's credit card privileges may be revoked at any time
at the discretion of their department head or the Chief Fiscal and Accounting
Officer.
      (2)   The card issued to the employee should only be used by the
cardholder unless otherwise directed by a department head or Chief Fiscal and

problem with a purchased item or service.  Examples include broken merchandise,
the billed amount does not match the quote, the billed amount includes sales
tax, the statement contains a charge not recognized by the cardholder, or the
statement contains duplicate charges from a vendor.  In these instances, the
cardholder should try to resolve the dispute with the supplier or merchant.  If
the purchased item needs to be returned for any reason, send the item back to
the supplier and request a credit to the purchasing card account.  Report to
Finance any unique billing issues. 
   (f)   Accounting/record keeping.  The Village uses the online Master Card
Smart Data system to document all transactions made at the card holder level. 
The system records transaction date, posting date, amount and description. 
Expenses are segregated by department.  Departments (card holders) are required
to input invoice date, expense description, expense account coding, PO number
and PO date for each transaction.  In addition an itemized receipt is required
to be uploaded with the corresponding expense.  A review and approval (by
department head/level manager) requirement is also built into the system.  All
data support and approvals must be in place to process the monthly payments. 
The Payables Clerk generates the expense reports at the card holder level which
equate to the monthly billing.  The expense reports, details and monthly bill
are reviewed by the Chief Fiscal & Accounting Officer to ensure proper
documentation of expenses and adherence to the guidelines set forth herein and
in the Village travel policy.  The monthly bill is paid electronically after
initiation by the Payables Clerk.
   (g)   Employee credit card agreement.  All Village officials and employees
issued Village credit cards shall be required to execute an agreement
substantially in the following form:
   I, _____________________________ , agree to the following regarding my use
of the Village of Evendale Credit Card:
   1.    I accept responsibility for the protection and proper use of this
credit card as outlined in the Credit Card Policy that I have received, read

Village credit card.  Failure to do so may result in either revocation of my
use privileges or other disciplinary actions.

credit card for personal use or gain that I will reimburse the Village for all
charges, taxes and any fees related to the collection of those charges.

   (a)   This policy shall apply to all Village-financed travel. The Director
of Administrative Services and/or a department head may impose additional
restrictions due to budgetary constraints or other purposes. Pre-approval by a
department head for all travel is required and budgeted funds must be
available. Travel reimbursement requests that exceed the following guidelines
must be signed by the Mayor or Director of Administrative Services. Employees
are encouraged to use good judgment when traveling, in that their travel is
funded by the taxpayer's dollar.
   (b)   Direct billing.  Whenever possible, certain travel related items
should be billed directly to the Village (registration, lodging, airline
tickets).
   (c)   Allowable travel expenses.
      (1)   Transportation.
         A.   Use of Village vehicles: If authorized by the supervisor,
employees will be reimbursed for fuel purchased. Use of Village credit card for
fuel is permitted. Original receipts required.

use his/her own vehicle, mileage will be reimbursed at the current IRS mileage
rate for all other employees.
      (2)   Airfare.
         A.   When at all possible airfare should be billed directly to a
Village credit card. If an employee does not have access to Village credit card
the employee will be reimbursed for airfare charges. Airfare should be booked
as early as possible to reduce cost to the Village. All airfare will be booked
at coach or the equivalent rate except under extraordinary circumstances.
         B.   In accordance with the State of Ohio Ethics Commission rulings,
frequent flyer miles may be accrued only if they are used for Village related
business travel. If an employee chooses to use frequent flyer miles in
connection with Village business, it is his/her responsibility to keep track of
the accrual/usage for auditing purposes. Frequent flyer miles cannot be used to
upgrade tickets. Accrual of hotel points, rental car company enticements and
other inducements in connection with Village related travel is prohibited.
      (3)   Other transportation expenses: With original receipts/
documentation, other approved travel related expenses (tolls, taxi fares, and
parking costs) will be reimbursed to the employee.
      (4)   Lodging: If at all possible, lodging expenses for approved travel
should be paid by the Village directly by check or use of employee's Village
credit card. If unable to be paid by the Village, employees will be reimbursed
for the cost of reasonable lodging. In either case, a detailed billing and
proof of payment are required. When making lodging reservations, the employee
should notify the establishment that the Village of Evendale is tax exempt. A
tax exempt certificate should accompany any direct payment for lodging or
should be taken by the employee if employee is to be reimbursed at a later
date. If the establishment does not accept the Village's tax exempt status,
reimbursement will be made for any lodging tax paid by the employee. Employees
should notify the Administration Department prior to travel so that the proper
tax exempt forms can be provided. Room rates may not exceed the rate
established at GSA.gov by more than $50 without prior approval from the Mayor
or Director of Administrative Services. All GSA.gov rates are updated annually
effective October 1 through September 30.
      (5)   Meals.
         A.   Approved overnight travel: Employees will be provided a full-day
per diem rate for each full-day of travel based on the location of the travel
destination and the rates established for that region at GSA.gov which
calculates both per diem rates and reimbursable meal rates by location. In the
absence of any unusual circumstances, partial day per diem will be paid at ¾
the full-day per diem for departure and/or arrival traveling days. Unique
situations shall be reviewed and decided upon by the supervisor. An employee's
daily per diem will not be prorated for meals provided as part of a conference
or seminar registration. The daily per diem rate includes meals, beverages,
taxes and tips.
               The employee may choose to use their Village issued credit card
for meal payment rather than using a per diem rate. In this event all charges
for meals must have an original detailed receipt for support documentation. The
Village will not reimburse an employee for alcohol purchases under any
circumstance.
         B.   "Day-trip" seminars/conferences: Employees will not be reimbursed
for personal meals purchased during "day-trip" seminars/ conferences.

Administrative Services, business meals (business luncheons) will be reimbursed

alcoholic beverage total.

no later than three days after returning from business travel, or upon

      Step 2. Department head.
      If the grievant is not satisfied with the response received from Step 1,
the individual may pursue the matter by presenting the original copy of the
grievance to the proper department head within three working days of receipt of
the Step 1 answer. The department head shall hold a hearing within seven
working days of receipt. The employee may be accompanied by a representative of
his/her choosing, but if an employee representative is chosen, the aggrieved
must notify that employee's department head in advance of the hearing so that
the employee representative may be relieved of duty, if necessary, to attend
the hearing. The department head, after review and investigation of all matters
of fact relative to the grievance, shall issue their decision on the grievance
form, within five working days following the hearing. If the department head is
also the aggrieved employee's immediate supervisor, the grievant shall proceed
from Step 1 to Step 3. If the aggrieved employee is a department head or the
Director of Administrative Services, the grievant shall proceed from Step 1 to
Step 4.
      Step 3. Mayor.
      Where the grievant is not satisfied with the Step 2 response, the
aggrieved employee may submit the original grievance to the Mayor within three
working days of the receipt of the Step 2 answer. The Mayor will review the
grievance and all responses within ten working days following the day the Mayor
received the grievance. If the Mayor determines that responses were adequate
and proper, the Mayor will so inform the grievant of the decision by letter. If
the Mayor desires additional information, the Mayor may hold, within seven
working days of receipt of the Step 2 answer, a hearing, as outlined in Step 2.
The Mayor shall conduct such hearing, and issue a response within ten working
days. The Mayor's response shall be reported to the Council.
      Step 4. Council.
      Where the grievant is not satisfied with the response received from Step
3, the individual may pursue the matter by presenting the original copy of the
grievance and the Mayor's response within three working days of the Step 3
answer to the Village Clerk for delivery to Council. The Council shall, at the
next regular meeting occurring more than seven days after the receipt of the
Step 3 answer, hold a hearing. Council, at its option, may hear the matter at
an earlier special meeting occurring prior to their next regular meeting. The
employee may be accompanied to such hearing by a representative of his/her
choice, but if an employee representative is chosen, the aggrieved must notify
that employee's department head in advance of the hearing so that the employee
representative may be relieved of duty, if necessary, to attend the hearing.
The Council, after review and investigation of all matters of fact relative to
the grievance, shall issue their decision on the grievance by resolution
following the hearing. The Council's decision shall be final and shall be
reported to the Mayor.

TITLE TEN - Judicial
   Chap.
290.   Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 290
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE:  Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Evendale has
jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of an
Evendale ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving
moving traffic violations occurring on State highways located within the
corporate limits of Evendale, subject to the limitations of Ohio R.C. 2937.08
and 2938.04.  In keeping his or her docket and file, the Mayor shall be
governed by the laws pertaining to county courts.
      Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is
charged with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the
charge is such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be
tried before him or her unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him or
her, waives a jury and consents to be tried by the magistrate.  If the
defendant, in such event, does not waive his or her right to a jury trial, then
the magistrate shall require the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear
before a court of record in Hamilton County (the Cincinnati Municipal Court)
and the magistrate shall thereupon certify all papers filed, together with a
transcript of proceedings and accrued costs to date, and such recognizance, if
given, to the court of record.  However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of
Criminal Procedure provides that in petty offense cases, where there is a right
to jury trial, the defendant shall be tried by the court unless he or she
demands a jury trial.  But the jurisdiction of a Mayor's Court, in such cases,
is further limited by Rule 9 of the Ohio Traffic Rules, which provides that if
a jury demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and the defendant
waives his or her right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case only
if (1) his or her compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon
criminal case convictions, or (2) he or she is not the chief executive and
administrative officer of the municipality and as such responsible for the
financial condition of the municipality.  Guilty and no contest pleas may be
taken by any mayor.
      Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury
shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with
the clerk of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set
for trial or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set
for trial, whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of
Criminal Procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04, provides
that right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing
therefor and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days
prior to the date set for trial, or on or before the third day following
receipt of notice of the date set for trial, whichever is later.  Failure to
claim a jury trial as provided herein is a complete waiver of the right
thereto.  Ohio R.C. 2938.04 provides, further, that a jury trial may not be had
in courts not of record, but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right
to a jury trial may be asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such
case to a court of record as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
      Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a
jury at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Evendale ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
      The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated "Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas," the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969.  Amended
Rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1975.

   Where a fine may be imposed in whole or in part, in punishment of a
misdemeanor provided for by ordinance of the Municipality, the Judge has
authority, except in cases of indigence, to order that the defendant stand
committed to the jail or workhouse until the fine is paid.  The Court may order
that such person stand committed to such jail or workhouse until the fine is
paid or secured to be paid, or he is otherwise legally discharged.  Persons so
imprisoned shall receive credit upon such fine at the rate of fifty dollars
($50.00) per day.

deposit, copies of public records in the Mayor's Court at the same rates as
charged for copies of other public records.  Such receipts shall be accounted
for by the Clerk as additional funds from the Mayor's Court.

290.08  LICENSE AS BOND; NOTICE OF PENALTIES.
   (a)   A person arrested without warrant for any violation listed in division
(b) of this section, and having a current valid Ohio driver’s or commercial
driver’s license, if the person has been notified of the possible consequences
of the person’s actions as required by division (c) of this section, may post
bond by depositing the license with the arresting officer if the officer and
person so choose, or with Mayor’s Court if it has jurisdiction and if the court
and person so choose.  The license may be used as bond only during the period
which it is valid.
      (1)   When an arresting officer accepts the driver’s or commercial
driver’s license as bond, the officer shall note the date, time, and place of
the court appearance on “the violator’s notice to appear” and the notice shall
serve as a valid Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license until the date
and time appearing thereon.  The arresting officer immediately shall forward
the license to the appropriate court.
      (2)   When Mayor’s Court accepts the license as bond or continues the
case to another date and time, it shall provide the person with a card in a
form approved by the registrar of motor vehicles setting forth the license
number, name, address, the date and time of the court appearance, and a
statement that the license is being held as bond.  The card shall serve as a
valid license until the date and time contained in the card.
      (3)   Mayor’s Court may accept other bond at any time and return the
license to the person.  The court shall return the license to the person when
judgment is satisfied, including, but not limited to, compliance with any court
orders, unless a suspension or revocation is part of the penalty imposed.
      (4)   Neither “the violator’s notice to appear” nor a Mayor’s Court
granted card shall continue driving privileges beyond the expiration date of
the license.
      (5)   If the person arrested fails to appear in Mayor’s Court at the date
and time set by the court or fails to satisfy the judgment of the court,
including, but not limited to, compliance with all court orders within the time
allowed by the court, the court may declare the forfeiture of the person’s
license.  Thirty days after the declaration of forfeiture, the court shall
forward the person’s license to the registrar.  The court shall enter
information relative to the forfeiture on a form approved and furnished by the
registrar and send the form to the registrar who shall suspend the license and
send written notification of the suspension to the person at the person’s last
known address.  No valid driver’s or commercial driver’s license shall be
granted to the person until the court having jurisdiction orders that the
forfeiture be terminated.  The court shall inform the registrar of
determination of the forfeiture by entering information relative to the
determination on a form approved and furnished by the registrar and send the
form to the registrar.  The court also shall charge and collect from the person
a processing fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00) to cover the cost of the Bureau of
Motor Vehicles in administering this action.  The clerk of the court shall
transmit monthly all such processing fees to the registrar for deposit into the
State Bureau of Motor Vehicles Fund created by Ohio R.C. 4501.25.
      (6)   In addition, the following provisions of Ohio R.C. 2937.221 apply. 
Upon receipt from the court of the copy of the declaration of forfeiture,
neither the registrar nor any deputy registrar shall accept any application for
the registration or transfer of registration or any motor vehicle owned by or
leased in the name of the person named in the declaration of forfeiture until
the court having jurisdiction over the offense that lead to the suspension
issues an order terminating the forfeiture.  However, for a motor vehicle
leased in the name of a person named in a declaration of forfeiture, the
registrar shall implement the preceding sentence until the registrar adopts
procedures for that implementation under Ohio R.C. 4503.39.  Upon receipt by
the registrar of such an order, the registrar also shall take such measures as
may be necessary to permit the person to register a motor vehicle the person
owns or leases or to transfer the registration of such a vehicle if the person
later makes a proper application and otherwise is eligible to be issued or to
transfer a motor vehicle registration.
   (b)   (1)   Division (a) of this section applies to persons arrested for
violation of:
         A.   Any of the provisions of Ohio R.C. Chapter 4511 or 4513, except

a citation for the commission of a minor misdemeanor under Ohio R.C. 2935.26.
   (c)   No license shall be accepted as bond by an arresting officer or by
Mayor’s Court under this section until the officer or court has notified the
person that, if the person deposits the license with the officer or court and
either does not appear on the date and at the time set by the officer or the
court, if the court sets a time or does not satisfy any judgment rendered,
including but not limited to, compliance with all court orders, the license
will be suspended, and the person will not be eligible for reissuance of the
license or issuance of a new license, or the issuance of a certificate of
registration for a motor vehicle owned or leased by the person until the person
appears and complies with any order issued by the court. The person also is
subject to any criminal penalties that may apply to the person.

CHAPTER 300
Discrimination against handicapped persons
300.01   Grievance procedures.
300.01  GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES.
   (a)   The Village of Evendale has adopted an internal grievance procedure
providing for prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action
prohibited by the Office of Revenue Sharing (ORS) regulations (31 C.F.R. 51.55
(d) (2)) implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended
(29 U.S.C. 794).  Section 504 states, in part, that "no otherwise qualified
handicapped individual . . . . shall solely by reason of his handicap, be
excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected
to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial
assistance...."
   (b)   Complaints should be addressed to: Village of Evendale Clerk, Evendale
Municipal Building, 10500 Reading Road, Evendale, Ohio 45241-2574, who has been
designated to coordinate Section 504 compliance efforts.
      (1)   A complaint should be filed in writing, containing the name and
address of the person filing it, and briefly describe the alleged violation of
the regulations.
      (2)   A complaint should be filed within ten days after the complainant
becomes aware of the alleged violation.  (Processing of allegations of
discrimination occurring before this grievance procedure was in place will be
considered on a case-by-case basis.) Filing shall not take place until the
Village is in actual physical custody of the written complaint.
      (3)   An investigation, as may be appropriate, shall follow a filing of a
complaint.  The investigation will be conducted by Village of Evendale Clerk. 
These rules contemplate informal but thorough investigations, affording all
interested persons and their representatives, if any, an opportunity to submit
evidence relevant to a complaint.  Under 31 C.F.R. 51.55 (d) (2), the Village
of Evendale need not process complaints from applicants for employment or from
applicants for admission to post-secondary educational institutions.
      (4)   A written determination as to the validity of the complaint and
description of resolution, if any, shall be issued by Village of Evendale
Clerk, and a copy forwarded to the complainant no later than 40 days after its
filing.
      (5)   The Section 504 coordinator shall maintain the files and records of
the Village of Evendale relating to the complaints filed.
      (6)   The complainant can request a reconsideration, in writing, of the
case in instances where he or she is dissatisfied with the resolution.  The
request for reconsideration should be filed within ten days to the Mayor of the
Village of Evendale.  Filing shall not take place until the Village is in
actual physical custody of said written request for reconsideration.
      (7)   The right of a person to a prompt and equitable resolution of the
complaint filed hereunder shall not be impaired by the person's pursuit of
other remedies such as the filing of a Section 504 complaint with the Office of
Revenue Sharing, U.S. Department of the Treasury.  Utilization of this
grievance procedure is not a prerequisite of the pursuit of other remedies.
      (8)   These rules shall be construed to protect the substantive rights of
interested persons, to meet appropriate due process standards and to assure
that the Village of Evendale complies with Section 504 and the ORS regulations.

fine of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the

412.06  REGULATING LOAD LIMITS AND USE OF RESIDENTIAL PORTION OF GLENDALE-
MILFORD RD. BY LARGE COMMERCIAL VEHICLES.
   (a)   The use of Glendale-Milford Road, (east of Kingsport Drive), by trucks
and commercial vehicles as a through road has become hazardous to the
residential character of the neighborhood through which that road passes.  The
road is hilly and unsuitable for regular use by truck and commercial traffic. 
The use of those roads by truck and commercial traffic causes excess damage to
the roadways, curbs and gutters, and landscaping along this residential
street.  Additionally, large vehicles create a safety hazard as they are unable
to ascend the hill except at a very slow speed in a no passing zone and must
stop at traffic lights on the down hill grade.
   (b)   No person shall operate a truck, a tractor-trailer, or a commercial
vehicle upon Glendale-Milford Road (east of Kingsport Drive) which has or is
equipped with four or more axles.
   (c)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under division (b) of this
section that the truck or commercial vehicle was making a delivery within the
residential area of the village along or accessed by way of Glendale-Milford
Road.
   (d)   The penalty for violation of division (b) of this section shall be
that provided in Section
408.01 and
408.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Evendale.
   (e)   The Service Department of the village shall erect appropriate signs
along Glendale-Milford Road, indicating that through trucks and commercial
vehicles with four or more axles are prohibited.

414.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section.  Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway,
or portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence
districts, the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. 
Where two or more through highways designated under this division intersect and
no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop.  Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

414.03  TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

414.04  SIGNAL TO CONTROL LANE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A Steady Downward Green Arrow.  A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A Steady Yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow.  A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A Steady Red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“don't walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.

offense, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as
shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the

violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense, if
there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of
less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified in subsections (a)
(1)B., C.,  D. and E. of this section, or less than the applicable
concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection (a)(1)J. of this
section, that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This subsection does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
      The person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a
qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing
administer a chemical test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to
any administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. The form to be
read to the person to be tested, as required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.

relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the blood,
breath of urine, if a law enforcement officer has administered a field sobriety
test to the operator or person in physical control of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceedings.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B. 1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence
is admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony
or evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of
fact considers to be appropriate.

defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability for Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which blood
is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section, is immune from criminal
liability and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any
other claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in
withdrawing blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection is
not available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful
or wanton misconduct.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)

this section and if Ohio R.C. 4510.13 permits the court to grant limited
driving privileges, the court may grant the limited driving privileges in

the court impose as a condition of the privileges that the offender must
display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under Ohio R.C. 4503.231, except as provided in

penalty established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the
vehicle as determined by publications of the national auto dealers association.
The proceeds of any fine so imposed shall be distributed in accordance with
division (C)(2) of that section.
      (6)   As used in subsection (h) of this section, “electronic monitoring,”

violates subsection (b) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle after
underage alcohol consumption and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (i)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. In addition to
any other sanction imposed for the offense, the court shall impose a class six
suspension of the offender's driver's license, commercial driver's license,
temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating

the range specified in division (A)(4) of Ohio R.C. 4510.02.
      (3)   If the offender also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1414 and if the court

to division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2929.24.
   (j)   Physical Control Penalty. Whoever violates subsection (d) hereof is
guilty of having physical control of a vehicle while under the influence, a

driver's license, commercial driver's license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C. 4510.02.
   (k)   Compliance With Ohio R.C. Chapter 3793 Standards.
      (1)   No court shall sentence an offender to an alcohol treatment program
under this section unless the treatment program complies with the minimum
standards for alcohol treatment programs adopted under Ohio R.C. Chapter 3793
by the Director of Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services.
      (2)   An offender who stays in a driver's intervention program or in an
alcohol treatment program under an order issued under this section shall pay
the cost of the stay in the program. However, if the court determines that an

this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court's indigent drivers' alcohol
treatment fund.
   (l)   Appeal Does Not Stay Operation of License Suspension. If a person
whose driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended under this section files an appeal regarding
any aspect of the person's trial or sentence, the appeal itself does not stay
the operation of the suspension.
   (m)   Subsection (a)(1)J. of this section does not apply to a person who
operates a vehicle while the person has a concentration of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's

of a controlled substance listed in subsection (a)(1)J. of this section also
apply in a prosecution of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.16(D) in the same
manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for a prohibited concentration of
alcohol.
   (o)   Conflict of Terms. All terms defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 apply to
this section. If the meaning of a term defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 conflicts
with the meaning of the same term as defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01 or this
Traffic Code, the term as defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 applies to this section.
   (p)   Indigent Drivers Alcohol Treatment Fund. Twenty-five dollars ($25.00)
of any fine imposed for a violation of subsection (a) hereof shall be deposited
into the municipal or county indigent drivers alcohol treatment fund pursuant

   (c)   (1)   Any person under arrest for operating a vehicle while under the
influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, for
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol in the blood,
breath or urine shall be advised at a police station, or at a hospital, first-
aid station, or clinic to which the person has been taken for first-aid or
medical treatment, of both of the following:
         A.   The consequences, as specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(E), of the

      (2)   A.   The advice given pursuant to division (c)(1) of this section
shall be in a written form containing the information described in division (c)
(2)B. of this section and shall be read to the person. The form shall contain a
statement that the form was shown to the person under arrest and read to him or
her in the presence of the arresting officer and either another police officer,
civilian police employee, or an employee of a hospital, first-aid station, or

"You now are under arrest for operating a vehicle while under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or both alcohol and a drug of abuse and will be
requested by a police officer to submit to a chemical test to determine the
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or alcohol and drugs of abuse in your
blood, breath or urine.
   If you refuse to submit to the requested test or if you submit to the
requested test and are found to have a prohibited concentration of alcohol in
your blood, breath or urine, your driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit or nonresidential operating privilege immediately will be suspended for
the period of time specified by law by the officer, on behalf of the Registrar
of Motor Vehicles, you may appeal this suspension at your initial appearance
before the court that hears the charges against you resulting from the arrest
and your initial appearance will be conducted no later than five days after the
arrest. This suspension is independent of the penalties for the offense, and
you may be subject to other penalties upon conviction."
   (d)   (1)   If a person under arrest as described in division (c)(1) of this
section is not asked by a police officer to submit to a chemical test
designated as provided in division (a) of this section, the arresting officer
shall seize the state or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license
or permit of the person and immediately forward the seized license or permit to
the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the charge for which he
or she was arrested. If the arrested person does not have the person's driver's
or commercial driver's license or permit on the person's self or in the
person's vehicle, the arresting officer shall order him or her to surrender it
to the law enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after
the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the officer's employing agency immediately
shall forward the license or permit to the court in which the arrested person
is to appear on the charge for which he or she was arrested. Upon receipt of
the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the initial appearance
of the arrested person and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196. If a
person under arrest as described in division (c)(1) of this section is asked by
a police officer to submit to a chemical test designated as provided in
division (a) above and is advised of the consequences of his or her refusal or
submission as provided in division (c) above, and if the person either refuses
to submit to the designated chemical test or the person submits to the
designated chemical test and the test results indicate that his or her blood
contained a concentration of 0.10% or more by weight of alcohol, his or her
breath contained a concentration of 0.10 grams or more by weight of alcohol per
210 liters of his or her breath, or his or her urine contained a concentration
of 0.14 grams or more by weight of alcohol per 100 milliliters of his or her
urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting officer shall do all of
the following:
         A.   On behalf of the Registrar, serve a notice of suspension upon the
person that advises the person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions
imposed upon him or her pursuant to any other section of the Revised Code or
any other municipal ordinance his or her driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended, that the
suspension takes effect immediately, that suspension will last at least until
his or her initial appearance on the charge that will be held within five days
after the date of his or her arrest or the issuance of a citation to him or
her, and that he or she may appeal the suspension at the initial appearance;
seize the state or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit of the person; and immediately forward the seized license or permit to
the Registrar. If the arrested person does not have the person's driver's or
commercial driver's license or permit on the person's self or in the person's
vehicle, the arresting officer shall order him or her to surrender it to the
law enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the
service of the notice of suspension, and upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
         B.   Verify the current residence of the person and, if it differs
from that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit,
notify the Registrar of the change;
         C.   In addition to forwarding the arrested person's driver's or
commercial driver's license or permit to the Registrar, send to the Registrar,
within 48 hours after the arrest of the person, a sworn report that includes
all of the following statements:
            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle upon a
highway or public or private property used by the public for vehicular travel
or parking within this municipality while under the influence of alcohol, a
drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse or with a prohibited
concentration of alcohol in the blood, breath or urine;
            2.   That the person was arrested and charged with operating a
vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a
drug of abuse or with operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of
alcohol in the blood, breath or urine;
            3.   That the officer asked the person to take the designated
chemical test, advised the person of the consequences of submitting to the
chemical test or refusing to take the chemical test, and gave the person the
form described in division (c)(2) of this section;
            4.   That the person refused to submit to the chemical test or that
the person submitted to the chemical test and the test results indicate that
his or her blood contained a concentration of 0.08% or more by weight of
alcohol, his or her breath contained a concentration of 0.08 grams or more by
weight of alcohol per 210 liters of his or her breath, or his or her urine
contained a concentration of 0.11 grams or more by weight of alcohol per 100
milliliters of his or her urine at the time of the alleged offense;
            5.   That the officer served a notice of suspension upon the person
as described in division (d)(1)A. of this section;
      (2)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under division
(d)(1)C. of this section shall be given by the officer to the arrested person
at the time of the arrest or sent to the person by regular first class mail by
the Registrar as soon thereafter as possible, but no later than 14 days after
receipt of the report. An arresting officer may give an unsworn report to the
arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the report is complete when
given to the arrested person and is subsequently sworn to by the arresting
officer. As soon as possible, but no later than 48 hours after the arrest of
the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the sworn report to the
court in which the arrested person is to appear on the charge for which he or
she was arrested.
      (3)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed and sent to the
Registrar and the court under divisions (d)(1)C. and (d)(2) of this section is
prima facie proof of the information and statements that it contains and shall
be admitted and considered as prima fade proof of the information and
statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(H) relative
to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from the arrest covered
by the report.
   (e)   (1)   A suspension of a person's driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege under division (d)(1)A. of
this section for the period of time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(E) or (F)
is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer serves
the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent finding that
the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in his or her being
requested to take, or in his or her taking, the chemical test or tests under
division (a) of this section affects the suspension only as described in Ohio
R.C. 4511.191(H)(2).
      (2)   If a person arrested for operating a vehicle while under the
influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse or for
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol in the blood,
breath or urine and regardless of whether the person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is or is not
suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(E) or (F), the person's initial appearance
on the charge resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the
person's arrest or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any
continuance granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.191(H)(1) regarding
the issues specified in that division.
   (f)   No person whose driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege has been suspended under this section, Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.196 shall operate a vehicle upon the highways or streets
within this municipality. However, it is an affirmative defense to any
prosecution brought pursuant to this section that the alleged offender drove
under suspension because of a substantial emergency, provided that no other
person was reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.
   (g)   Whoever violates division (f) of this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the first degree. The court, in addition to or independent of
all other penalties provided by law, may suspend for a period not to exceed one
year the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege of any person who pleads guilty to or is convicted of a
violation of division (f) of this section.

while children are going to or leaving school during the opening or closing
hours, and when 20 miles per hour school speed limit signs are erected, except
that on controlled-access highways and expressways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by division (b)(4) of this section, and on freeways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by divisions (b)(10) and (b)(11) of this section.  The end of every school zone
may be marked by a sign indicating the end of the zone.  Nothing in this
section or in the Manual and Specifications for a Uniform System of Traffic-
Control Devices shall be construed to require school zones to be indicated by
signs equipped with flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of
the hours in which the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means any school chartered
under Ohio R.C. 3301.16 and any nonchartered school that during the preceding
year filed with the Department of Education in compliance with O.A.C. 3301-35-
08, a copy of the school's report for the parents of the school's pupils
certifying that the school meets State minimum standards for non-chartered,
nontax-supported schools and presents evidence of this filing to the
jurisdiction from which it is requesting the establishment of a school zone.
“School” also includes a special elementary school that in writing requests the
County Engineer to create a school zone at the location of the school. Upon
receipt of such written request, the County Engineer shall create a school zone
at that location by erecting appropriate signs.
         C.   As used in this section, “school zone” means that portion of a
street or highway passing a school fronting upon the street or highway that is

highway, and also includes that portion of a State highway.  Upon request from
local authorities for streets and highways under their jurisdiction and that
portion of a State highway under the jurisdiction of the Director of
Transportation or a request from a County Engineer in the case of a school zone
for a special elementary school, the Director may extend the traditional school
zone boundaries.  The distances in divisions (b)(1)C.1. through 3. below shall

lines normal to the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;

each approach direction;
            3.   The distance encompassed by the special marking of the
pavement for a principal school pupil crosswalk plus a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction of the highway.
         D.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the
Director's initial action on August 9, 1976, establishing all school zones at
the traditional school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property
lines, except when those boundaries are extended as provided in divisions (b)
(1)A. and (b)(1)C. of this section.
         E.   As used in this division, "crosswalk" has the meaning given that
term in Ohio R.C. 4511.01(LL)(2).
         F.   The Director may, upon request by resolution of the Legislative
Authority and upon submission by the Municipality of such engineering, traffic,
and other information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school
zone on any portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that
includes a crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school

commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in R.C. § 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid

noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise

to §
698.02(e)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.

of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance.

substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender’s license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s
driver license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license or nonresident operating privilege from the range

with electronic monitoring under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section unless,
within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on

offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.
      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of house
arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release during that

in Ohio R.C. 4503.231(B).
      (2)   A suspension of a commercial driver's license under this section
shall be concurrent with any period of suspension or disqualification under
Ohio R.C. 3123.58 or 4506.16. No person who is disqualified for life from

operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.

elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.

      (1)   A.   The Municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall
            issue a special regional heavy hauling permit authorizing the
applicant to operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a permit
issued by the Director of Transportation under Ohio R.C. 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the State highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the Municipality.  No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the State highway
system.  The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the Municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the Municipality.  Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued.  The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
            the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing
the permit, and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to
the roadway or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of
the nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles. 
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of

specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be issued,
the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the vehicle
and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned upon the
sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the roadway or
a street or highway structure.  In addition, the Municipality, as a condition
of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to develop and
enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate for or to
repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit.  No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.

section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.

other legitimate business or act other than passage through the Municipality.
Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a State route or a designated
truck route within the Municipality shall confine such deviation to that
required in order to accomplish the purpose of the departure.  On County roads
Council or other duly designated local authority shall establish reasonable
weight limits commensurate with the construction and material specifications
for such roads and the load resistance of such roads as determined by the
County Engineer. County roads shall be posted with signs indicating such weight
limits.
   (d)   Local Permit and Conditions.  Upon application and for good cause, the
Police Chief may Issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.

of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon State routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, u the Police Chief in his
discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction project.
The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of operation for
such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route, hours, speed
or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the preservation of the
public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief may require the
posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for any damage to a
roadway or road structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge two dollars
($2.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the Police
Department in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant shall pay
the sum of five dollars ($5.00).
      (4)   Except as provided in division (h) of this section, signs shall be

import to apprise drivers of the limitations imposed by this section.  No
driver shall disobey the Instructions indicated on any such sign.
      (5)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit.  Such

not be released to its owner until the owner presents proof of ownership of the
motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally imposed by the
Municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles.  If the motor vehicle is a
leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the lessee
presents proof that that person is the lessee of the motor vehicle and pays all

parking locations are required to be designated in accordance with division (e)
of this section shall fail to properly mark the special parking locations in
accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of the special
locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed or movable
signs.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person or

452.05  WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The County Sheriff or Chief of Police, within the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway patrol trooper, upon
notification to the Sheriff or Chief of Police of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the Sheriff, Chief of Police, or
state highway patrol trooper as a result of the performance of the Sheriff’s,
Chief’s, or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Sheriff
or Chief of Police of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
However, when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may
be ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the Sheriff, Chief of Police, or state highway patrol
trooper shall allow the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to
arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified
by the Sheriff, Chief of Police, or state highway patrol trooper. If the
Sheriff, Chief of Police, or state highway patrol trooper determines that the
vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of time, the Sheriff,
Chief of Police, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the Sheriff or Chief of
Police shall designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered
removed.
   (b)   If the Sheriff, Chief of Police, or a state highway patrol trooper
issues an order under division (a) of this section and arranges for the removal
of a motor vehicle by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the
motor vehicle to the location designated by the Sheriff or Chief of Police not
more than two hours after the time it is removed.
   (c)   (1)   The Sheriff or Chief of Police shall cause a search to be made
of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain the identity of the
owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the Sheriff
or Chief of Police, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business
days of the removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the Sheriff
or Chief of Police shall send or cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at
the owner’s or lienholder’s last known address by certified mail with return
receipt requested, notice that informs the owner or lienholder that the motor
vehicle will be declared a nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten
days of the date of mailing of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
Sheriff, Chief of Police, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to
be necessary to a criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles has been conducted and
after notice has been sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this
section, and the search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice
was sent to the motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or
lienholder shall pay to the place of storage a processing fee of $25, in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of mailing of the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police,
without charge to any party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county
in which the place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with
the requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the
Clerk, without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances, to the Sheriff or Chief of Police. If the
vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other
facility as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police shall execute in triplicate
an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, describing the
motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and that all
requirements of this section have been complied with. The Sheriff or Chief of
Police shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or
other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor
vehicle salvage dealer, the Clerk of Courts, within 30 days of the
presentation, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
   (g)   Abandonment of Junk Motor Vehicle Prohibited.
      (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the
municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (g) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing
of the abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
municipality from the disposal.

   (a)   (1)   The Sheriff or Chief of Police, upon complaint of any person
adversely affected, may order into storage any motor vehicle, other than an
abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has been left
on private residential or private agricultural property for at least four hours
without the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property. The Sheriff or Chief of Police, upon complaint of a repair garage or
place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle, other than an
abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left at the garage or place of

      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under division (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the Sheriff or Chief of Police not more than two hours after the time it is

natural disaster, or other event that is not within the power of the towing
service.

or structures.
   (b)   (1)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. §
4921.25 in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use

(ORC 2901.01, 2921.01; Ord. 21-83. Passed 3-15-83.)
606.02  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

years after the offense is committed.
   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (b)(2) of this section,
if the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)(3) of this
section has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an
element is fraud or breach of fiduciary duty within one year after discovery of
the offense either by an aggrieved person or by the aggrieved person's legal
representative who is not a party to the offense.
      (2)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)(3)
of this section has expired, prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2913.49
shall be commenced within five years after discovery of the offense either by
an aggrieved person or the aggrieved person’s legal representative who is not a

      (2)   As used in this division:

office of a public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of
Ohio R.C. 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A),

involving misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any
municipal ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code
sections listed in this division (c)(2)A.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2921.01.

      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation

      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in

the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

(ORC 2901.13)
606.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person's liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the section defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Culpability."  Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   "Intoxication."  Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   "Involuntary acts."  Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   "Possession."  A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor's control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity.  “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.

606.09  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.

606.10  FALSIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall knowingly make a false statement, or knowingly swear
or affirm the truth of a false statement previously made, when any of the
following applies:
      (1)   The statement is made in any official proceeding.
      (2)   The statement is made with purpose to incriminate another.
      (3)   The statement is made with purpose to mislead a public official in
performing his or her official function.
      (4)   The statement is made with purpose to secure the payment of

sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.

commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.

State law.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in
conspiracy, is not an offense under this section.

      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio
R.C. 2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.

more than three minutes in any one hour shall be unlawful.
      (2)   An emission of such opacity as is described in this section shall
not be deemed a nuisance and unlawful if such opacity is due to the
condensation of water vapors containing emitted particulate matter not in
excess of 0.49 grains air contaminant per standard cubic foot of emission. 
(Ord. 49-70. Passed 7-8-70.)
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth

percent CO2 allowed to escape into the air or allowed to pass any convenient
measuring point in the chimney or breeching system is hereby declared to be an
air pollution nuisance and shall be unlawful. In no case shall equipment
installed for removing solid particles from combustion gases produce a total
separating efficiency of less than eighty-five percent by weight.
      (2)   An example of "adjusted to twelve percent CO2 "is as follows: if
solid matter in combustion gases at test conditions is .4 pound per 1,000
pounds of gases and test shows ten percent CO2 in the gases, then the solid
particles adjusted to twelve percent CO2 would be calculated as follows:
.40 x 12 or .48 pounds per 1,000 pounds of gas adjusted to 12% CO2

keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the

Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency

appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, R.C. § 955.11(D)
and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and the
owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog, and
R.C. § 955.54 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog,
and the court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply
with respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As
part of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to
obtain the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount
described in division (l)(5)B. of this section.

   (a)   (1)   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of this chapter or
Ohio R.C. Chapters 2925 or 3719, a laboratory report from the Bureau of
Criminal Identification and Investigation or a laboratory operated by another
law enforcement agency, or a laboratory established by or under the authority
of an institution of higher education that has its main campus in this State
and that is accredited by the Association of American Universities or the North
Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, primarily for the
purpose of providing scientific service to law enforcement agencies, and signed
by the person performing the analysis, stating that the substance that is the
basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of
unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or
the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,
or substance included in Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V, a laboratory report
from the Bureau or from any laboratory that is operated or established as
described in this division that is signed by the person performing the
analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis of the alleged offense
have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as to the content,
weight, and identity of each of the substances, is prima facie evidence of the
content, identity, and weight of the substances.
      (2)   Attached to that report shall be a copy of a notarized statement by
the signer of the report giving the name of the signer and stating that the
signer is an employee of the laboratory issuing the report and that performing
the analysis is a part of the signer's regular duties, and giving an outline of
the signer's education, training, and experience for performing an analysis of
materials included under this section.  The signer shall attest that
scientifically accepted tests were performed with due caution, and that the
evidence was handled in accordance with established and accepted procedures
while in the custody of the laboratory.
   (b)   The prosecuting attorney shall serve a copy of the report on the
attorney of record for the accused, or on the accused if the accused has no
attorney, prior to any proceeding in which the report is to be used against the
accused other than at a preliminary hearing or grand jury proceeding where the
report may be used without having been previously served upon the accused.
   (c)   The report shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents,
identity, and weight or the existence and number of unit dosages of the
substance if the accused or the accused's attorney demands the testimony of the
person signing the report, by serving the demand upon the prosecuting attorney,
within seven days from the accused or the accused's attorney's receipt of the
report.  The time may be extended by a trial judge in the interests of justice.
   (d)   Any report issued for use under this section shall contain notice of
the right of the accused to demand, and the manner in which the accused shall
demand, the testimony of the person signing the report.

Chapters 2925 or 3719 is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have a portion of the substance that is, or of each of the
substances that are, the basis of the alleged violation preserved for the
benefit of independent analysis performed by a laboratory analyst employed by
the accused person, or, if the accused is indigent, by a qualified laboratory
analyst appointed by the court.  Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused's analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances.  The
prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's analyst with the sample
portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial.  If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused's analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused's attorney.  In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused's privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to
receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the analysis
and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings, or
opinions concerning the identity of the substance or substances subject to the
analysis.
   (f)   In addition to the rights provided under division (e) of this section,
any person who is accused of a violation of this chapter or Ohio R.C. Chapters
2925 or 3719 that involves a bulk amount of a controlled substance, or any
multiple thereof, or who is accused of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, other than a minor misdemeanor
violation, that involves marihuana, is entitled, upon written request made to
the prosecuting attorney, to have a laboratory analyst of the accused's choice,
or, if the accused is indigent, a qualified laboratory analyst appointed by the
court, present at a measurement or weighing of the substance that is the basis
of the alleged violation.  Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result
from the measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving
at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number
of unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

   (g)   In addition to the financial sanctions authorized or required under
Ohio R.C. 2929.18 and 2929.28 and to any costs otherwise authorized or required
under any provision of law, the court imposing sentence upon an offender who is
convicted of or pleads guilty to a drug abuse offense may order the offender to
pay to the state, municipal, or county law enforcement agencies that handled
the investigation and prosecution all of the costs that the state, municipal
corporation, or county reasonably incurred in having tests performed under this
section or Ohio R.C. 2925.51 or in any other manner on any substance that was
the basis of, or involved in, the offense to determine whether the substance
contained any amount of a controlled substance if the results of the tests
indicate that the substance tested contained any controlled substance. No court
shall order an offender under this section to pay the costs of tests performed
on a substance if the results of the tests do not indicate that the substance
tested contained any controlled substance. The court shall hold a hearing to
determine the amount of costs to be imposed under this section. The court may
hold the hearing as part of the sentencing hearing for the offender.

offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially similar municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02,
2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or
2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more
than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, 
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense.  If an offender is being tried for the commission of a
series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value
of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series.  Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

that involves alleged tampering with a gas, electric, steam or water meter,
conduit or attachment of a utility that has been disconnected by the utility,
proof that a meter, conduit or attachment of a utility has been tampered with

has caused the tampering with intent to commit a theft offense.
   (b)   In a prosecution for a theft offense, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2913.01,
that involves the alleged reconnection of a gas, electric, steam or water

and if the officer does not charge the person with a violation of this section
or arrest the person for any offense, the person is not otherwise prohibited by

698.01  DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Dangerous offender" means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   "Repeat offender" means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 2913.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or
more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)   Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses, as

for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent felony drug
abuse offense;
      (5)   Having been convicted of two or more felonies, and having been
imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, the person commits a
subsequent offense;
      (6)   Having been convicted of three or more offenses of any type or
degree other than traffic offenses, alcoholic intoxication offenses, or minor
misdemeanors, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense, the person commits a subsequent offense.
(ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section
666.99 or
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23  or division (b)(5) or (b)
(6) of this section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant
to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section.  The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
(ORC 2929.24(A) - (D))
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type
described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1416 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional
jail term shall not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Ohio Revised
Code. The offender shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and
prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to
any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
(Ord. 10-38.  Passed 8-12-10.)
      (6)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(6)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24(F) - (H))
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender.  The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the
conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in R.C. § 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (c)(4)B. of this section.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d).  Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender's occupation or care
for the offender's family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor, or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house,  community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division.  Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of day reporting;
         B.   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring

         L.   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         M.   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender's privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender's motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator's license, or any other related sanction;
         N.   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(ORC2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2947.23,
the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a
minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or
combination of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f). If the
court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial
sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not
limited to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim's economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the Clerk of the Court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. The court may base the
amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by the victim, the
offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or receipts indicating
the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other information, provided
that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court decides to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the court holds an
evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has the burden to
prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution sought from
the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than 5% of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.

            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (f), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to
be credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. §
111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, State, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the Clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a County Court or
a Municipal Court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a County Court or a Municipal Court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 301.28. If the court is a Municipal Court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
(ORC2929.28) (Ord. 04-06. Passed 1-8-04.)
698.03  IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under Section
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under Section
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future crime.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or written
statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney, or the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
698.04  ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000.00);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand
dollars ($3,000.00);
      (4)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two thousand
dollars ($2,000.00);
      (5)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00);
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05  MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or  sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another State, or the United States.  Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131.  When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a
prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a State correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of
imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one
or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.

850.01  PURPOSE.
   The United States Supreme Court has recognized that door-to-door canvassers,
"whether selling pots or distributing leaflets, may lessen the peaceful
enjoyment of a home," and that "burglars frequently pose as canvassers, either
in order that they may have a pretense to discover whether a house is empty and
hence ripe for burglary, or for the purpose of spying out the premises in order
that they may return later." Martin v City of Struthers, 319 U.S. 141,144
(1943). These problems continue to be associated with door-to-door canvassing,
as are even graver ones.
   Therefore, the public purpose of this chapter is to vigorously protect the
First Amendment right of free speech and its accompanying promise of anonymity
for the door-to-door canvassers, while prudently balancing that right with the
government's equally important role in preventing fraud, minimizing crime,
protecting the personal security of its citizens, and above all, facilitating
every citizen's personal right to privacy.
(Ord. 06-55A. Passed 12-14-06.)
850.02  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   (a)   “Canvasser.” Any individual who enters upon private property without
invitation or permission for the purpose of door-to-door canvassing as defined
below.
   (b)   “Charitable/religious/political solicitation.” Door-to-door canvassing
by any person, the primary purpose of which is to solicit funds or sell goods
for the benefit of charitable or not-for-profit organizations, or for the
purpose of providing information, either written or oral, to the occupants of
the dwelling about candidates for public office, political issues, or religious
or church related matters.
   (c)   “Commercial solicitation.” The act of door-to-door canvassing for the
purpose of soliciting orders for or making sales of goods, wares, merchandise,
or service, or seeking donations or raising funds for any cause or organization
for profit without prior appointment or permission of the occupant or occupants
of such dwellings, and which is not charitable/religious/ political
solicitation.
   (d)   “Door-to-door canvassing.” Entering upon private property and/or
private residences with the purpose of contacting the occupants thereof either
face-to-face, by depositing documents at the residence, or both, but without
invitation or permission to do so by the owners or occupants of such private
property or residences. This shall include but not be limited to such
activities that are for the purpose of advertising, promoting, selling,
explaining and/or proselytizing any product, service, organization or cause, or
for the purpose of surveying or poll-taking. “Door-to-door canvassing” shall
include both commercial solicitation and charitable/ religious/political
solicitation. It is not the purpose of this chapter to regulate activities such
as a mail carrier or meter reader entering upon private property in performance
of his or her duties, or other similar persons where permission to enter
property is implied by the service rendered.

within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable
benchmark, the Village Council shall:

the proposed rates will continue in effect.
      (3)   Such public hearing may be held in conjunction with other ICRC
communities under the direction of the ICRC.
   (d)   Extended review period.
      (1)   If the Village Council is unable to determine whether the rates in
issue are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material
before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the
Village Council shall, within 60 days from the date the cable operator filed
its basic cable rates with the village and by adoption of a formal resolution,
invoke the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final
determination:
         A.   90 days if the Village Council needs more time to ensure that a
rate is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard; or
         B.   150 days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service
showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable benchmark.
      (2)   If the Village Council has not made a decision within the 90 or 150
day period, the Village Council shall issue a brief written order at the end of
the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all
amounts received by reason of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts
are paid.
   (e)   Public hearing.  During the extended review period and before taking
action on the proposed rate, the Village Council or the ICRC shall hold at
least one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views
and record objections.
   (f)   Objections.  An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed initial basic rate may request the secretary to record the
objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing
anytime before the decision resolution is adopted.  In order for an objection
to be made part of the record the objector must provide the secretary with the
objector's name and address.
   (g)   Benchmark analysis.  If a cable operator submits its current basic
cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC's reasonable rate
standard, the Village Council or the ICRC shall review the rates using the
benchmark analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. 
Based on the Village Council or the ICRC's findings, the initial basic cable
rates shall be established as follows:
      (1)   If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those
rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator's rates
will be capped at that level.
      (2)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates
shall be the greater of the cable operator's per channel rate on September 30,
1992, reduced by 10 percent, or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for
inflation and any change in the number of channels occurring between September
30, 1992, and the initial date of regulation.
      (3)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the
cable operator's per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30,
1992, the initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for
inflation.
   (h)   Cost-of-service showings.  If a cable operator does not wish to reduce
the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity
to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify an initial basic
cable rates above the FCC's reasonable rate standard.  The Village Council will
review a cost-of-service review.  The Village Council may approve initial basic
cable rates above the benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary
showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in rates below the
benchmark or below the cable operator's September 30, 1992, rates minimum 10
percent, will prescribe the cable operator's new rates.
   (i)   Decision.
      (1)   By formal resolution.  After completion by the village or the ICRC
of its review of the cable operator's proposed rates, the Village Council shall
adopt its decision by formal resolution. The decision shall include one of the
following:
         A.   if the proposal is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or
is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, the Village Council shall approve
the initial basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or
         B.   if the proposal is not within the FCC's reasonable rate standard
and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates,
the Village Council shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within
the FCC's reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service
analysis.
      (2)   Rollbacks and refunds.  If the Village Council determines that the
initial basic cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or
that the cable operator's cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, the
Village Council may order the rates reduced in accordance with paragraph (g) or
(h) above, as applicable. In addition, the Village Council may order the cable
operator to pay to subscribers, refunds of the excessive portion of the rates
with interest (computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue
Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments), retroactive to September
1, 1993.  The method of paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the Village Council's decision
resolution.
      (3)   Statement of reasons for decision and public notice.  If rates
proposed by a cable operator are disapproved in whole or in part, or if there
were objections made by other parties to the proposed rates, the resolution
must state the reasons for the decision and the Village Council must give
public notice of its decision.  Public notice will be given by advertisement
once in the official newspaper of the village.
   (j)   Appeal.  The Village Council's decision concerning rates for the basic
service tier or associated equipment, may be appealed to the FCC in accordance
with applicable federal regulations.

not be given more often than annually and not until at least one year after the
determination of the initial basic cable rates.
   (b)   Expedited determination and public hearing.
      (1)   If the Village Council or the ICRC is able to expeditiously
determine that the cable operator's rate increase request for basic cable
service is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the
applicable price cap, the Village Council shall:
         A.   hold a public hearing at which interest persons may express their
views; and
         B.   act to approve the rate increase within 30 days from the date the
cable operator filed its request with the village.
      (2)   If the Village Council takes no action within 30 days from the date
the cable operator filed its request with the village, the proposed rates will
go into effect.
      (3)   During the extended review period and before taking action on the
proposed rate, the Village Council or the ICRC shall hold at least one public
hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record
objections.
   (c)   Extended review period.
      (1)   If the Village Council and the ICRC are unable to determine whether
the rate increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard base on the
material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing,
the Village Council shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the
following additional periods of time as applicable, to make a final
determination:
         A.   90 days if the Village Council or the ICRC needs more time to
ensure that the requested increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard
as determined by the applicable price cap; and
         B.   150 days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service
showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the applicable price cap.
      (2)   The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review
period.
      (3)   If the Village Council has not made a decision within the 90 to 150
day period, the Village Council shall issue a brief written order at the end of
the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all
amounts received by reason of the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf
the amounts are paid.
   (d)   Public hearing.  During the extended review period and before taking
action on the requested rate increase, the Village Council or the ICRC shall
hold at least one public hearing at which interested persons may express their
views and record objections.
   (e)   Objections.  An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed rate increase may request the secretary to record the objection
during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing anytime before
the decision resolution is adopted.  In order for an objection to be made part
of the record, the objector must provide the secretary with the objector's name
and address.
   (f)   Delayed determination.  If the Village Council is unable to make a
final determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended
time period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to
subsequent refund if the Village Council later issued a decision disapproving
any portion of the increase.
   (g)   Price cap analysis.  If a cable operator presents its request for a
rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC's price cap, the Village
Council shall review the rate using a price cap analysis in accordance with the
standard form authorized by the FCC.  Based on the Village Council's findings,
the basic cable rates shall be established as follows:
      (1)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap
established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable
rates.
      (2)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap
established by the FCC, the Village Council shall disapprove the proposed rate
increase and order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap.
   (h)   Cost-of-service showings.  If a cable operator submits a cost-of-
service showing an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap, the
Village Council will review the submission pursuant the FCC standards for cost-
of-service review.  The Village Council may approve a rate increase above the
price cap if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-
of-service determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the
cable operator's then current rate will prescribe the cable operator's new
rate.
   (i)   Decision.  The Village Council's decision concerning the requested
rate increase, shall be adopted by formal resolution.  If a rate increase
proposed by a cable operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or if
objections were made by other parties to the proposed rate increases, the
resolution must state the reasons for the decision.  Objections may be made at
the public hearing by a person requesting the secretary to record the objection
or may be submitted in writing at anytime before the decision resolution is
adopted.
   (j)   Refunds.
      (1)   The Village Council may order refunds of subscribers' rate payments
with interest if:
         A.   The Village Council was unable to make a decision within the
extended time period as described in paragraph (c) above; and
         B.   The cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end of
the extended review period; and
         C.   The Village Council determines that the rate increase as
submitted exceeds the applicable price cap or that the cable operator failed to
justify the rate increase by a cost-of-service showing, and the Village Council
disapproved any portion of the rate increase.
      (2)   The method of paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the Village Council's decision
resolution.
   (k)   Appeal.  The Village Council's decision concerning rates for the basic
service tier or associated equipment, may be appealed to the FCC in accordance
with applicable federal regulations.

890.04  ALLOCATION OF PROFITS OR LOSSES, BUSINESS LOSSES, LOSS CARRY FORWARD,
DEPRECIATION.
   (a)   Allocation formula.  The portion of the net profits attributable to
the Village of Evendale of a taxpayer conducting a business, profession or
other activity both within and without the boundaries of the Village of
Evendale shall be determined by multiplying the entire net profits of the
business by a business allocation percentage formula to be determined by:
      (1)   Step 1. Ascertain the percentage which the average original cost of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession and situated with the Village during the taxable period,
is to the average original cost of all of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession during the
same period, wherever situated. As used above, real property and tangible
personal property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer, and
the value of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental
thereon by eight.
      (2)   Step 2. Ascertain the percentage which the gross receipts of the
business or profession from sales made and services performed in the Village is
to gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales and services, wherever made or performed.
      (3)   Step 3. Ascertain the percentage which the total qualifying wages,
including vacation pay, sick pay, disability pay, personal leave pay,
commissions, bonuses, incentive payments, separation pay, tips, severance pay,
stock options, supplemental unemployment pay, any pay as part of an employee
buyout or wage continuation plan or any other remuneration paid during the
taxable period to persons employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village is of the total paid for the above items to all
employees within and outside the Village during the period.
      (4)   Step 4.  Add together the percentages and divide the total by the
number of percentages used in deriving such total. The result is the business
allocation formula.
      (5)   A factor is applicable, even though it may be allocable entirely in
or outside the Village.
   (b)   Substitute method.  In the event a just and equitable result cannot be
obtained under the business allocation formula, the Tax Administrator shall
have the authority to substitute other factors in the business apportionment
percentage formula or prescribe other methods of allocating net profits
calculated to effect a fair and proper apportionment.
   (c)   Business losses.  The net operating loss sustained by a business or
profession is not deductible from employee earnings, but may be carried forward
as provided in the rules and regulations.  However, if a taxpayer is engaged in
two or more taxable business activities to be included in the same return, the
net loss of one unincorporated business activity (except any portion of a loss
reportable for municipal income tax purposes to another municipality) may be
used to offset the profits of another for purposes of arriving at overall net
profits.  No portion of a net operating loss shall be carried back against net
profits of any prior year.
   (c)   Three year loss carried forward, implemented in incremental stages.
      (1)   The portion of a net operating loss, based on income taxable under
this chapter, sustained in the taxable year beginning after December 31, 2000,
allocable to the Village of Evendale may be applied against the portion of
succeeding years allocable to the Village of Evendale, until exhausted, but in
no event for more than four years immediately following the year in which the
loss was sustained. No portion of a net operating loss shall be carried back
against the net profits of any prior year.
      (2)   The portion of a net operating loss, based on income taxable under
this chapter, sustained in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2001,
allocable to the Village of Evendale may be applied against the portion of
succeeding years allocable to the Village of Evendale, until exhausted, but in
no event for more than three years immediately following the year in which the
loss was sustained. No portion of a net operating loss shall be carried back
against the net profits of any prior year.
      (3)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the Village of Evendale in the same manner as provided herein for allocating
net profits to the Village of Evendale.
      (4)   The Administrator shall provide by rules and regulations, the
manner in which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.
      (5)   The net operating loss of a taxpayer that loses its legal identity,
by any means, such as a merger or consolidation, shall not be allowed as a
carry-forward loss deduction to the surviving or new taxpayer.
   (d)   Recapture of depreciation.  Capital gains and losses from sale,
exchange or other disposition of property shall not be taken into consideration
in arriving at net profits earned. However, any amount or value realized on a
sale, exchange or other disposition of tangible personal property or real
property used in business in excess of book value shall be treated as taxable
income under this chapter to the extent of depreciation allowed or allowable.

890.05  EFFECTIVE PERIOD.

890.06  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Returns required.
      (1)   On or before April 15 of each year, every person subject to the
provisions of
Chapter 890 of the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Evendale shall, except
as hereinafter provided, make and file with the Administrator, a return on a
form prescribed by and obtainable upon request from the Administrator, whether
or not a tax is due.

year, said return shall be filed on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth
month following the end of such fiscal year or other period.

that the return of an employer or employers, showing the amount of tax deducted
by said employer or employers from the qualifying wages, commissions or other
compensation of an employee, and paid by him or them to the Administrator shall
be accepted unless otherwise specified as the return required of any employee
whose sole income, subject to tax under this chapter, is such qualifying wages,
commissions, or other compensation.
      (2)   An employee who is paid on a qualifying wage, commission or other
compensation basis and who pays his or her business expense from his or her
qualifying wage, commission or other compensation, without reimbursement from
his or her employer, may deduct from his or her qualifying wage, commission or
other compensation, business expenses allowed by the Internal Revenue Service
for Federal income tax purposes, but only to the extent said expenses are
incurred in earning commissions or other compensations subject to the tax
imposed by this chapter. The employee must file a return in order to claim such
deductions, even though all or parts of such qualifying wage, commission or
other compensation are subject to withholding. Business expenses allowed shall
be those expenses allowed to be claimed on the Federal Form 2106 and upon the
request of the Tax Administrator, verifiable with supporting schedules and/or
receipts. Failure to produce the supporting schedules and/or receipts upon
request of the Tax Administrator shall result in disallowance of the expenses
in question. No expenses claimed on Federal Form Schedule A, Itemized
Deductions, shall be allowed.
   (c)   Joint returns.  A husband and wife may file either separate returns or
a joint return for municipal purposes, even though one of the spouses has
neither taxable income nor deductions included on the Municipal return,
regardless of whether their Federal and State returns are filed separately or
jointly. If a joint city return is made, the tax shall be computed on the
aggregate taxable income and the liability, with respect to the tax, shall be
joint and several.
   (d)   Forms.  The return shall be filed with the Administrator on a form or
forms furnished by or obtainable upon request from such Administrator, or an
acceptable generic form that contains all of the information required to be
submitted with the Village's prescribed form, setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of qualifying wages, including vacation pay,
sick pay, disability pay, bonuses, separation pay, personal leave pay,
commissions, bonuses, incentive payments, tips, severance pay, stock options,
supplemental unemployment pay, or any other remuneration that is paid to or
constructively received by the recipient; gambling winnings, and the net
profits from any business profession or other activity, including the rental
from use of real and personal property, distributive shares from pass-through
entities and other income defined by statue as taxable, received for the period
covered by the return and such other pertinent facts and detail information as
required by the Tax Administrator;
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, or other
information as the Administrator may require, including statements that
document the amounts used in the return are the amounts used on the return for
Federal income tax, adjusted to set forth only such income taxable under the
provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   The Village shall accept a generic form of any return, report, or
document required to be filed if the generic form, once completed and filed,
contains all of the information required to be submitted with the Village's
prescribed returns, reports or documents, and if the taxpayer or return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the rules or
ordinances of the Village governing the filing of returns, reports or
documents.
      (5)   The fact that any taxpayer is not required to file a Federal tax
return does not relieve him or her from filing a Village tax return.
   (e)   Extensions of time.
      (1)   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a Federal
income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a Village of
Evendale tax return. The taxpayer shall make the request by filing a copy of
the taxpayer's request for a Federal filing extension with the Administrator.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to file a Federal income tax return may
request an extension for filing a Village of Evendale tax return in writing.
      (3)   The request for extension shall be filed not later than the last
day for filing the Village of Evendale tax return as prescribed by ordinance or
rule of this municipal corporation.
      (4)   A valid extension request extends the due date for filing a return
to the last day of the month following the month to which the due date of the
Federal income tax return has been extended.
      (5)   The Tax Administrator may deny a taxpayer's request for extension
if the taxpayer:
         A.   Fails to timely file the request;
         B.   Owes the Village of Evendale any delinquent income tax or any
penalty, interest, assessment or other charge for the late payment or
nonpayment of income tax; or
         C.   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (6)   The granting of an extension for filing a Village of Evendale
income tax return does not extend the last date for payment of the tax; hence,
penalty and interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the period of extension
at the rate set out by Section
890.11. No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is
filed and the final tax paid within the extension period, provided all other
filing and payment requirements of the Tax Code have been met. Any extension by
the Administrator shall be granted with the understanding that declaration
filing and payment requirements have been fulfilled; however, if, upon further
examination, it then becomes evident that declaration filing and payment
requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be assessed in
full and in the same manner as though no extension had been granted.
      (7)   Information returns, schedules and statements required to support
tax returns which are incomplete without such information shall be filed within
the time limits set forth for the filing of the tax returns, and the failure to
file such information returns, schedules and statements shall be a violation of
this chapter.
   (f)   Payment of taxes.
      (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of filing thereof,
pay to the Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereon; provided,
however, that where any portion of the tax so due shall have been deducted at
the source pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, or where any portion of
said tax shall have been paid by the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of
this chapter, or where an income tax has been paid to another municipality,
credit for the amount so paid is limited to the tax rate of the Village of
Evendale, in accordance with this chapter, shall be deducted from the amount
shown to be due and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the
time of filing said return.
      (2)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the Village
of Evendale is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his or
her election, indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall
be refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than five
dollars ($5.00) shall be collected or refunded.
      (3)   The fact that any taxpayer is not required to file a Federal tax
return does not relieve him from filing a Village tax return.
   (g)   Consolidated returns.
      (1)   A.   Consolidated returns may be permitted from affiliated groups
of corporations that file consolidated returns (for the same tax reporting
period) for Federal Income Tax purposes beginning January 1, 2003.
         B.   Allocation data for each entity in the consolidated group must be
applied to each separate company's income or loss before consolidation.
      (2)   In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates, or some other method, or in the case any person
operates a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the
Village of Evendale constituting a portion only of its total business, the
Administrator shall require such additional information as he or she may deem
necessary to ascertain whether net profits are not properly allocated to the
Village of Evendale by reason of transactions with stockholders or with other
corporations related by stock ownership, interlocking directorates, or
transactions with such division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or
activity or by some other method, he or she shall make such allocation as he or
she deems appropriate to produce a fair and proper allocation of net profits to
the Village of Evendale.
   (h)   Amended returns.
      (1)   Where necessary an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in Sections
890.12 and
890.16. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Administrator or upon an acceptable generic form that contains all of the
information required to be submitted with the Village's prescribed form. A
taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or allocation of net profits
after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's tax liability to the Village of Evendale,
such taxpayer shall make and file an amended return showing income subject to
the income tax of the Village of Evendale based upon such final determination
of Federal tax liability, and pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make
claim for refund of any overpayment.

Such employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and withheld, whether or not such taxes have in fact been withheld.

incentive payments, separation pay, tips, severance pay, any pay received as

Evendale during the measurement period are less than five hundred dollars
($500.00) per month, payments may be made quarterly on or before the last day
of the month following the end of the quarter, subject to the approval of the
Administrator. The Administrator may revoke the approval of quarterly filing
and payments whenever he or she has reason to believe that the conditions for
granting such authorization have changed, where judged incorrectly, where not
met, or when it is in the best interest of the Village of Evendale to do so.
Notice of withdrawal shall be made in writing and, in such case, the employer
must begin to file on a monthly basis in accordance with this section.
   (c)   Such employer, in collecting said tax, shall be deemed to hold the
same, until payment is made by such employer to the Village of Evendale, as a
Trustee for the benefit of the Village of Evendale and any such tax collected
by such employer from his or her employees, shall, until the same is paid to
the Village of Evendale, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer.
Each employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and withheld, whether or not such tax, in fact, has been withheld.
   (d)   Any person who is required to withhold tax from salaries, wages,
commissions, and other compensation shall pay all such tax to the Village of
Evendale in accordance with the provisions of this section. In the event taxes
withheld from the salaries, wages, commissions, and other compensation of the
employees are not paid to the Village of Evendale in accordance with the
provisions of this section, all officers, members, managers, employees, and
trustees having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility of
filing the return and making payment are jointly and severally personally
liable for the tax not returned or paid to the Village of Evendale as well as
any related interest and penalties, and are also liable under the provisions of
Section
890.11 hereof. The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation,
limited liability company, S-Corporation, or business trust does not discharge
an officer's, member's, manager's, manager's employees, or trustee's liability
for a failure of the corporation, limited liability company, or business trust
to file returns or pay said taxes.
   (e)   On or before February 28 of each year, each employer shall file a
reconciliation showing the sum total of all compensation paid all employees,
the portion of which, (if any) was not subject to withholding, along with an
explanation for same, and the portion of which was subject to withholding,
together with the amount of such withholdings remitted. Such return shall
include information concerning each employee from whom the tax was withheld,
showing the name, address, zip code and social security number of each said
employee, the total amount of compensation paid during the year and the amount
of municipal tax withheld. If the total tax withheld from any employee included
tax withheld and remitted to another municipality, the amount of same shall be
separately shown on the return of information to the Village of Evendale
concerning each employee.
   (f)   In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-MISC
payments to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall
also report such payments to the Village of Evendale when the services were
performed in the Village. The information may be submitted on a listing, and
shall include the name, address and social security number (or Federal
Identification Number), and the amount of the payments made. Federal Form(s)
1099 may be submitted in lieu of such listing.
      (1)   Commissions and fees paid to professionals, brokers and others who
are independent contractors, and not employees of the payer are not subject to
withholding or collection of the tax at the source.
      (2)   Such taxpayers must, in all instances, file a declaration and
return and pay the tax pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and Rules and
Regulations.
   (g)   Employers who do not maintain a permanent office or place of business
in the Village, but who are subject to tax on net profits allocable to the
Village under the method of allocation provided for in this chapter, are
considered to be employers within the Village and are subject to the
requirements of withholding.
   (h)   Where a nonresident receives compensation for personal services
rendered or performed partly within and partly without the Village, the
withholding employer shall deduct, withhold, and remit the tax on that portion
of the compensation which is earned within the Village with the following rules
of apportionment:
      (1)   If an employer is located within the Village, all nonresident
employees who report to the Village location are taxable to the Village unless
the employer is withholding tax for other taxing municipalities where the
employee's work is performed. For the purposes of determining the tax liability
of nonresident employees who report to the Village location and who perform
their work in non-taxing locations, only the wages paid for services performed
within the Village are considered taxable to the Village.
      (2)   If the nonresident is a salesman, agent or other employee whose
compensation depends directly on the volume of business transacted or chiefly
effected by him or her, the deducting and withholding shall attach to the
portion of the entire compensation which the volume of business transacted or
chiefly effected by the employee within the Village bears to the total volume
of business transacted by him or her within and outside the Village.
      (3)   The fact that nonresident employees are subject to call at any time
does not permit the apportionment of pay for time worked within the Village on
a seven-day per week basis. The percentage of time worked in the Village will
be computed on the basis of a 40-hour week unless the employer notifies the Tax
administrator that a greater or lesser number of hours per week is worked.  The
determination of tax liability of nonresidents working in and out of the
corporate limits is to be computed on the formula of the total number of days
worked in the Village, divided by the total number of days worked during the
year. The total number of days worked is considered to be 260 days, including
vacation days and holidays. The resulting percentage applies to the total
annual income from qualifying wages, including vacation pay, sick pay,
disability pay, personal leave pay, commissions, bonuses, incentive payments,
separation pay, tips, severance pay, stock options, supplemental unemployment
pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage continuation plan, or any
other remuneration.
   (i)   Compensation deferred before the effective date of this section is not
subject to any municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax
withholding requirement to the extent deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (j)   The Tax Administrator, for good cause, may require immediate returns
and payments to be submitted to his or her office.
   (k)   Domestic servants. No person shall be required to withhold the tax on
the wages or other compensation paid domestic servants employed exclusively in
or about such person's residence. However, such domestic servants shall be
responsible for filing and paying their own returns and taxes.
(Ord. 03-11. Passed 4-3-03; Ord. 05-01.  Passed 1-13-05.)

operating loss carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years
following the taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for

      (1)   "Domicile" means the true, fixed and permanent home of the taxpayer
to which whenever absent, the taxpayer intends to return.
      (2)   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the municipality for
all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in the
municipality on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if
the Tax Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in
the municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
      (3)   An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
division (a)(1) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
   (b)   For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled in
the municipality for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be

891.05  COLLECTION AT SOURCE
891.051  COLLECTION AT SOURCE; WITHHOLDING FROM QUALIFYING WAGES.
   (a)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
891.052 or division (d) or (f) of this section. An employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying
wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (a)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (b)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         A.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)B. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the end of each calendar
quarter.
         B.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399) or if the total amount of
taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf
of the municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars ($200.00). Payment under division (b)(1)B. of this section
shall be made to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the
last day of each month.
   (c)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
891.091.
   (d)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (e)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (f)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (g)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (h)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (i)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (k)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's

reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's principal place of work with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division
(b)(2) of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for

that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
891.051.
         D.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional entertainer,

      (2)   For the purposes of division (b)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         A.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         B.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         C.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has

principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (c)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (b)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.

during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold

remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (d)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (d)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (e)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
891.03.  To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax
Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for the preceding
taxable year.
   (f)   Divisions (b)(1) and (d) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section

deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;

liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (d)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall

be indicated on the annual return.

shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (f)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover

the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:

personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (g)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (h)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax

returns required under this section.

         B.   “Adjusted federal taxable income” is defined in Section
891.03(c)(1).
      (2)   “Exempt income” is defined in Section

telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Ohio
R.C. Chapter 5745.
   (a)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compen-sation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
891.052;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipality;
         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
891.19(a).
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by

      (4)   Nothing in division (b) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and

         B.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         C.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (c)(1)B. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria in division (d)(1)A., B. or C. for taxable years beginning
on or after January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017; and only if, regardless
of where title passes, the property meets either of the following criteria A.

         A.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         B.   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from a
location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion.
         C.   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (e)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.

accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (f)   (1)   Except as provided in division (f)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section 891.081.
   (g)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under Section 891.03(c)(11)L. and (c)(34)A.4., by a municipal
corporation to which the taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its net profit,
the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the
taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation. In no
case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned
to that municipal corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the
employee would be required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock
option not exempted from taxation.
   This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (h)   When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 4927.01.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 5727.01.
   (b)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in

period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under R.C. § 718.80, a
valid election made by the taxpayer under division (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this
section is binding upon the tax commission for the remainder of the five-year

intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year

corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
891.03(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass- through entity having at least
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
891.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the

purpose of making the computations required in Section
891.062, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass- through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
891.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
891.062 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (h)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

         A.   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds

      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
891.091.
         A.   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals and
are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is due
on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended

filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end

percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.

891.082  REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         B.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (a)(2)A. of this
section computed without regard to division (a)(2)B. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred com-pensation plan.
         C.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the qualifying tax rate is
a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall be
based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect to
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (c)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
non-qualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (d)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the non-qualified deferred
compensation.
(Ord. 15-49.  Passed 11- 17-15.)
891.083  CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Ohio R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Ohio R.C. 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
891.081.
(Ord. 15-49.  Passed 11-17-15.)
891.084  CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
891.096.
   (b)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
891.096, the municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
municipality claims is due. If the municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (c)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
891.096.
   (d)   Nothing in this section requires a municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
891.081 regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 15-49.  Passed 11-17-15.)
891.09  ANNUAL RETURN
891.091  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   (1)   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
municipal taxable income by the municipality shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the municipality under Section
891.051(c) when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income subject to

   (c)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (d)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed

   (e)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (f)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identi-fication number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form(s) W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all
information reported on the taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages
reported or withheld for any municipal corporation; the tax-payer's Internal
Revenue Service form 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund
request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the
adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the
annual return required by this section electronically is not required to
provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-

or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or a
portal provided by municipality. The Department of Taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio Business Gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The Department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (g)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division

Administrator.
         C.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
891.092 applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts
with any provision in Section
891.092, the provision in Section
891.092 prevails.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this section shall file with the
municipality an annual net profit return under division (f)(3) and (f)(4) of
this section.
   (i)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
Section
891.051(b)(1)B. or C.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (j)   The amounts withheld for the municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
891.051 shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits
against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld
were not remitted to the municipality and the recipient colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator of the municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
municipality's ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (m)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (n)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
891.052.
      (2)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         A.   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         B.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
               The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also
shall include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (n)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (n) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
   (o)   The failure of any employer or person to receive or procure a return,
declaration or other required forms shall not excuse him from making any
information return, return or declaration, from filing such form or from paying
the tax.

service terminates. Except as provided in division (b)(3) of this section, the
Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator
considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipality before the 181st day after the applicant's
active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (b)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the

the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (c)(2)A.
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         B.   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (c)(2)A. of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (d)   For each taxable year to which division (a), (b), or (c) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (b)(2) and (b)(3) or
(c) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
(Ord. 15-49.  Passed 11-17-15.)
891.093  USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (a)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal

withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (d)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities

party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (e)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing the
authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce the
provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 15-49.  Passed 11-17-15.)
891.094  EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (a)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (b)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (c)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (d)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension of
the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
   (e)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Ohio R.C. 5747.08, a
taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.

891.095  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, comp-utations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject

income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (b)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, comp-utations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
891.19 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed

that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars ($10.00) or less, no
refund need be paid by the municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (c)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
891.096. Except as set forth in division (c)(2) of this section, the request
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, comp-utations, and attachments were
re-opened.

forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (b)
(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
891.18.
   (c)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (b) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (d)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
Section
891.10(a)(4).
   (e)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
891.10.

Tax Administrator shall inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to
have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A tax-payer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the

alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit

891.132  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (a)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (b)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action is
in the best interests of the municipality:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and

time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (f)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. 15-49.  Passed 11-17-15.)
891.133  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (a)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (d)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (b)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
891.10, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
891.99.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (a) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
891.10.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
891.99 for a violation of Section
891.15 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.
(Ord. 15-49.  Passed 11- 17-15.)
891.14  CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by Ohio R.C. Chapter 718 or
by the charter or ordinance of the municipality is confidential, and no person
shall access or disclose such information except in accordance with a proper
judicial order or in connection with the performance of that person's official
duties or the official business of the municipality as authorized by Ohio R.C.
Chapter 718 or the charter or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax
Administrator of the municipality or a designee thereof may furnish copies of
returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and other related tax
information to the Internal Revenue Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and
Tax Administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit the municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 15-49.  Passed 11-17-15.)
891.15  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,

this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (b)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (c), (g), and (h) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the municipality in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an opinion of the Tax Administrator.

protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (d)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
891.15.
   (e)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (c) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (g)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (h)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (i)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (j)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under division (f) of this section may not be

(Ord. 15-49.  Passed 11-17-15.)
891.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (a)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Ohio R.C. 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (b)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a com-
promise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
(Ord. 15-49.  Passed 11- 17-15.)
891.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (a)   (1)   The legislative authority of the municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the municipality,
and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the
municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the Mayor,
as the top administrative official of the municipality. This member may be an
employee of the municipality, but may not be the director of finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by

authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Ohio R.C.

qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   The Local Board of Tax Review established under this chapter will
also serve under the authority provided in
Chapter 890 for tax matters applicable to tax years prior to the effective date
of this chapter.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day of the

final determination as provided in Ohio R.C. 5717.011.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under Ohio R.C. 149.43.  For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to Ohio R.C. 121.22. For this reason, such hearings shall
not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be present
during the hearing.

period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
891.18.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding,
or holding by any administrative body or court that the Local Board of Tax
Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did not have
jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that
assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the

the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final deter-mination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
891.18, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of
the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the amount due from
the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than the amount paid,
there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's assigns or legal
represen-tative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as provided by
Section
891.096, with interest on that amount as provided by division (d) of this

Hamilton County owns the R/W in fee.
   SECTION I
   DRIVEWAY REGULATIONS, GENERAL
   A.   RESPONSIBILITY:
   Within the unincorporated area of Hamilton County, no driveway intersecting
a County road shall be constructed or reconstructed until a permit, on the
proper form, has been issued by the Hamilton County Engineer's Permit
Department. Said permit shall be subject to the following regulations, except
that in specific instances and upon written request by the applicant, the
Hamilton County Engineer may authorize such variance from these regulations as
will not be contrary to the public interest or welfare, or where due to
conditions at the site, a literal enforcement would result in unnecessary
hardship.
   More than one driveway may be included on a single application and permit,
if all are part of the same project. Should work at the site involve other
types of construction, multiple permit fees may be required.
   The Hamilton County Engineer, or his representative, is charged with the
administration and enforcement of these regulations and provisions and shall
receive written permit applications, issue permits, examine the premises for
which such permits have been requested or issued, and enforce compliance with
the provisions of these regulations.
   The acceptance of a permit or the performance of any work thereunder shall
constitute an agreement by the party or parties to which the permit is granted
to comply with all of the conditions and restrictions printed or written
therein.
   The permit may at any time, be revoked or annulled by the Hamilton County
Engineer or his representative for nonperformance of or noncompliance with, any
of the conditions, restrictions and regulations thereof.
   Any person, firm, or corporation who performs work for which a permit is
required by these regulations without first having secured such a permit, or
fails to comply with the condition under which the permit was obtained, thereby
shall be deemed in violation of these regulations and subject to the penalties
provided by Sections 5589.10 and 5591.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   These regulations shall not prevent any person or persons, firm or
corporation from maintaining an installation as may be necessary for the
preservation of life and/or property when the need arises during the hours the
County Engineer's Office is closed; however, a permit request shall be made
within one calendar day after said office opens.
   B.   FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS:
   Before any driveway permit is issued, the applicant shall deposit with the
Hamilton County Engineer's Permit Department (for payment to the TREASURER OF
HAMILTON COUNTY) a check in the amount of Twenty Dollars ($20.00) as a non-
refundable fee.
   Failure to construct and/or complete the driveway in accordance with the
drawings included with the permit, shall be deemed a violation of Sections
5589.10 and 5591.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   C.   ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS:
   The application for a permit for construction or reconstruction of a
driveway shall be accompanied by a detailed plan in duplicate, showing all of
the proposed construction that would affect traffic movement both during and
after construction and shall include the following items: (Applicants prior to
preparation of plans, should familiarize themselves with the provisions of
Section II, Driveway Location and Section III, Driveway Construction.)
      1.)   Dimensional information relative to the exact location of the
property along the highway, north point, scale of drawing, and distance to
nearest street intersection or section line.
      2.)   Property lines, right-of-way lines, and the dimensions thereof.
      3.)   Distance between edge of pavement and right-of-way line. (Edge of
pavement is actual edge of the pavement structure.)
      4.)   The existing and the finished surface grade of the proposed
installation.
      5.)   Street inlets and all public utility structures which may affect
said driveway.
      6.)   Width of proposed and existing drive and the flair or radii
involved.
      7.)   Dimensions and type of construction of proposed island. (If any.)
      8,)   Location and dimensions of existing and proposed buildings if
within forty foot (40') of existing right-of-way.
      9.)   Location and description of existing and proposed drainage
structures within highway right-of-way, including invert dimensions, pipe
sizes, and pipe grades.
   10.)   Such other information as may be reasonably necessary to determine
the exact nature and extent of the work.
   The accuracy of the materials submitted shall be the responsibility of the
applicant. The Hamilton County Engineer's Office shall not be held responsible
for damages that my occur due to any inaccurate on incomplete nature of
materials submitted.
   D.   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   Upon receipt of the application (and the required monetary deposit) a field
review will be conducted at the location and checks made to determine if future
road improvements are planned. All applications for permits shall be dated upon
receipt.  The necessary review will be made as soon thereafter as practicable.
If the application and proposed work is found to be acceptable, the permit will
be issued.  In the event that corrections or modification's are deemed
necessary, the applicant will be so notified, and a copy of the plan marked as
appropriate, shall be returned to the applicant.  The applicant, after making
the necessary changes to the original drawing, shall re-submit the same number
that was required for the original submission, along with the marked copy
previously returned to him/her. The Hamilton County Engineer's Permit
Department will then reprocess the application and issue the permit, if the
required changes were made.  Revised plans, which are re-submitted shall be
marked as "revised" with the date of revision noted thereon near the drawing
title.
   Each permit shall have stated on its face the period of time for which it is
valid and said permit, or a legible copy thereof, must be on hand at the job
site. The maximum period of validity shall be one (1) year.  Should this time
period expire, prior to satisfactory completion of the driveway, the applicant
shall apply for a new permit and pay another fee ($20.00). All authorization to
work within the right-of-way is withdrawn once the original permit expires
unless the applicant has been issued a new permit.
   It shall be the responsibility of the holder of a permit to notify the
Hamilton County Engineer's Permit Department, forty eight (48) hours before
commencing work within the right-of-way.
   Upon completion of all work authorized in the permit, the permit holder
shall notify the Hamilton County Engineer's Permit Department.  No project
shall be deemed completed until said notification is given and any work
performed on installation made will be considered as unapproved.
   These regulations shall be coordinated as necessary and appropriate with the
Hamilton County Engineer's Subdivision Rules and Regulations and all other
codes in effect.
   All future maintenance responsibilities must be assumed by the applicant,
his grantees, successors, and assignees.
   SECTION II
   DRIVEWAY LOCATION
   A.   GENERAL:
   Driveways should be located so as to result in no undue interference with
the free movement of normal highway traffic. In accord with this principle,
driveways should be located where the highway alignment and profile are
favorable; i.e. where there are no sharp curves, or steep grades, and where
sight distance in conjunction with the driveway access would be adequate for
safe traffic operation. The sight distance requirements are a specified in the
current edition of the Ohio Department of Transportation Location and Design
Manual and A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets prepared by the
American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO),
Refer to Plate No. 31 of this manual.
   If future road improvement plans exist, this information shall be applied to
the degree applicable in determining the driveway location.
   No driveway entrance shall interfere with facilities such as; street lights,
traffic signal standards, signs, catch basins, hydrants, crosswalks, bus-
loading platforms, bus stops, fire alarm supports, or other structures within
the right-of-way. The party requesting the permit shall make arrangements with
the proper authority, and/or public utility, for the adjustment or relocation
of the facility affected if such is deemed permissible.  The Hamilton County
Engineer's Permit Department may request written assurance from the authority
or utility that adjustment or relocation is agreed upon. In no case will it be
permissible for a driveway to be located closer than five (5) feet to any poles
inlet, fire plug, etc. A driveway shall not be constructed at any angle less
than forty five degrees (450) with the line of the curb or the edge of the
roadway.
   B.   DESCRIPTION:
   The regulations as defined in Section II, Paragraph "C" through "H", except
as modified by these regulations, are in accordance with the latest edition of
the Ohio Department of Transportation Location and Design Manual.
   These regulations shall apply to all driveways covered by these regulations
unless altered or modified by other sections of these Hamilton County Driveway
Regulations.
   C.   CORNER ISLAND (PLATE NO. 1):
      1.)   Effective* corner radius of forty feet (40') or less.
   The beginning of the approach radius shall be at least twenty feet (20')
from the angular bisector as measured along the face of curb or pavement edge
when no sidewalks are involved. With sidewalks, the beginning of the approach
radius shall not begin nearer the roadway intersection than the back edge of
the sidewalk.
      2.)   Effective* corner radius greater than forty feet (40').
   The beginning of the approach radius shall not begin closer to the roadway
intersection than a distance equal to one-half of the effective*  intersection
radius as measured from the angular bisector along the face of curb or pavement
edge, except as noted below:
         a.)   When the highway intersection angle shown as on Plate No. 1 is
one hundred and twenty degrees (120°) or greater, the beginning of the approach
radius may begin twenty feet (20') from the angular bisector, as measured along
the face of curb or pavement edge.
         b.)   When the highway intersection radius is greater than eighty feet
(80'), the beginning of the approach radius may begin forty feet (40') from the
angular bisector.
      NOTE: No part of Section II is intended to supersede the Hamilton County
Regional Planning Commission regulation involving corner developments with ten
(10) or more parking spaces; which requires driveway openings to be fifty feet
(50') from the intersection of right-of-way lines.
      *Intersection pavements are not always built on the arc of a circle.
Therefore, the word "effective" is used to cover such instances.
   D.   APPROACHES (PLATE NO. 2, 2-A AND 2-B:
      1.)   General
         a.)   The location and angle of an approach or flair in relation to an
adjacent highway intersection shall be such that a vehicle entering or leaving
the site may turn out of or into the nearest lane of traffic, moving in the
desired direction and be channeled within this lane before entering the
intersection or proceeding along the highway.
         b.)   Where the effective radius of an approach or flare controls the
turning radius of a vehicle entering the driveway by a right turn from the
adjacent outside traffic lane of the roadway, the radius of that edge shall be
as long as practical to provide a free and safe movement.
         c.)   Approaches constructed on public property or right-of-way shall
be compatible to abutting pavement.
         d.)   Where curbing exists along the edge of the through pavement, the
edges of the approach or flair may be delineated by a curb through the arc of
the radius. Curbing along the entire approach or flair may be installed at the
option of the permit applicant, however, said curb shall be installed for
island work, except where there is existing sidewalk or where future sidewalk
is contemplated.
         e.)   To discourage improper use of intermediate island between dual
approaches, the island shall be seeded or sodded except for a four foot (4')
wide berm of stabilized material adjacent to the highway pavement.
      2.)   Design Criteria
         a.)   The interior angle shown as on Plate No. 2 between the axes of
dual approaches or flairs and the centerline of the roadway shall be no more
than ninety degrees (90°) and no less than forty five degrees (45°)
         b.)   The interior angle shown as on Plate No. 2 between the axes of a
single approach or flair, designed for two-way operation, shall be no more than
ninety degrees (90°) and no less than seventy degrees (70°).
         c.)   The width of all approaches or flairs shall not be greater than
thirty five feet (35') in the throat of the approach or flair measured at the
right angles to the axis of the approach or flair as shown on Plates No. 2, 2-
A and 8. Throat widths greater than thirty five feet (35') as shown on Plate
No. 2-B may be permitted, in unusual situations, by the Hamilton County
Engineer or his representative, upon written request. The applicant's written
request must justify the need for the width variance by utilizing pertinent
traffic data and related engineering information. The Hamilton County Engineer
reserves the right to require the submission of a Transportation Impact
Analysis prepared by a competent Traffic Engineer Registered to practice in the
State of Ohio and experienced in such analysis.
         d.)   Multiple driveway entrances will be permitted, but in no case
shall more than sixty percent (60%) of the property frontage be used for
driveway purposes. (Refer to Section H and Plate No. 3 for limits on frontage).
   E.   INTERMEDIATE ISLANDS:
   Between all approaches there shall be an intermediate island with a minimum
length "L" at the right-of-way (or easement) line, of six feet (6') for curbed
islands (or islands along curbed roadways) and fifteen feet (15') for un-curbed
islands.
   F.   SAFETY CURB:
   Where sidewalks occur (existing or proposed), safety curbs of portland
cement concrete or asphaltic concrete, not less than six inches (6") in height
and for the length "L" as noted in "E" above, shall be provided along the
right-of-way or easement line between approaches.
   G.   CURB RAMPS:
   At locations where sidewalks occur (existing or proposed) and curbs are
intended along the drive entrance, curb ramps meeting the applicable
requirements of O.D.O.T. Standard Drawing BP-2.1 and the requirements of Sec.
4.7 of the Americans with Disabilities Act (A.D.A.) shall be installed as
appropriate.
   H.   LOCATION OF APPROACHES IN RELATION TO SIDE PROPERTY LINE (PLATE NO. 3):
      1.)   Controls
         a.)   Ninety degree (90°) control line - A line at right angles to the
centerline of the highway which extends through the intersection of the side
property line with the highway right-of-way line.  (Usually can only be a
consideration when Hamilton County owns the right-of-way in fee simple.)
         b.)   Four foot (4') control - The maximum dimension, from edge of
pavement, that the approach radius, (flare) may extend along the ninety degree
(90°) control line (when the approach radius crosses the 90° control line). 
This maximum dimension is subject to Section H. 1. c. below.
         c.)   Extended property line control - A distance along the edge of
pavement between the ninety degree (90°) control line and the extended property
line. No portion of a driveway approach radius (flare) may extend beyond the
limits of this distance. This control is applicable where the highway easement
is not held in fee.
      2.)   Curbed Highways
   The approach radius may begin at, but shall not extend across the
intersection of the ninety degree (90°) control line and the pavement edge.
      3.)   Un-curbed Highways
   The approach radius, but not the approach edge extension, may cross the
ninety degree (90°) control line within the limits of the four foot (4')
control. (See (1) above.)
   I/J.   PAVED BERMS:
   In rural sections (where no curbing or paved berm exists) having a high
traffic volume and maximum speed limits, the berms may be paved for a distance
of one hundred and seventy five feet (175') preceding, and one hundred and
seventy five feet (175') following the entering and leaving approaches
respectively. This construction is subject to approval by the Hamilton County
Engineer and shall be constructed by the permit applicant, but maintained by
the County. This paved berm shall be not less than eight feet (8') in width and
need not be more than ten feet (10') in width. The ends of these paved berms
shall be tapered from one foot (1') to full width in seventy five feet (75'),
this taper being included in the overall length. The transverse slope of the
paved berm shall not be less than one-fourth inch (1/4") per foot, not more
than three-fourths inch (3/4") per foot sloping away from the pavement edge
(See Plate No. 4).
   SECTION III
   DRIVEWAY CONSTRUCTION
   A.   GENERAL:
   All work and all materials incorporated into driveways constructed under
provisions of permits issued by the Hamilton County Engineer's Permit
Department shall be in accordance with the requirements of the Construction and
Materials Specifications of ODOT (Current Edition) and supplements thereto (as
modified by the requirements set forth in "The Rules and Regulations of the
Office of the County Engineer Governing the Surface Improvements for Private
Development Within the Unincorporated Areas of Hamilton County")  and except as
may be modified by this manual.
   All driveways shall be adequate to support the loads to which they are to be
subjected. For residential driveways constructed with portland cement concrete,
the minimum thickness shall be seven inches (7") of 452 (except as may be
modified in the next paragraph).  Residential driveways constructed with
flexible pavement shall have a minimum thickness of six inches (6") of 304
Aggregate Base and two inches (2") of 404 Asphaltic Concrete. Nonresidential
driveways shall be constructed of eight inches (8") minimum thickness of 304
Aggregate Base, one and one-half inches (1½") minimum thickness of 402
Asphaltic Concrete and one and one-fourth inch (1-1/4") minimum of 404
Asphaltic concrete. Equivalent designs will be considered if requested by the
applicant. (Portland cement concrete shall be Class "C").
   Upon agreement by the permit applicant and the Hamilton County Engineer's
Permit Departments the thickness of residential portland cement concrete
driveways may be five inches (5"), if it can be demonstrated that the driveways
and approaches will not be subjected to heavy loads such as trucks transporting
fuel oil, water and concrete.
   A driveway which is to abut a concrete pavement shall be constructed of
either portland cement concrete or asphaltic concrete and aggregate base. A
driveway which is to abut an asphaltic concrete pavement shall be constructed
of asphaltic concrete and aggregate base or portland cement concrete. If the
applicant chooses to construct a port land cement concrete driveway apron along
an asphalt roadway pavement, a two foot (2') wide asphaltic concrete pavement
section shall be placed as a buffer between the roadway and the concrete
driveway pavement. This buffer section shall be constructed of the flexible
pavement materials and the thicknesses specified in the second paragraph above
(see Plates No. 7-A, 8, 8-A and 12-B).
   Where vertical concrete curbs exist, the curb shall be modified in
accordance with details on Plate No. 5. Where rolled concrete curbs exist, and
it is necessary to cut said curb for the construction of a commercial drive,
the curb shall be modified in accordance with details on Plate No. 6.
   Sidewalk extensions, as detailed on Plate No. 7, shall be constructed except
at those locations where no sidewalks presently exist or are anticipated in the
foreseeable future as determined by the Hamilton County Engineer.
   B.   PLAN:
   Driveway entrances shall have a width not less than ten feet (10') or more
than thirty five feet (35') measured at the edge of roadway (or back of curb).
This measurement shall not include the length of the chord, flare or radius
return on either side. (See Plates No. 2, 2-A, 7 and 8). (For possible variance
see Section II. D. 2. c.).
   Tooled contraction joints in the driveway apron shall not exceed a maximum
spacing of fifteen feet (15') in both longitudinal or transverse directions.
   Flares of different lengths may be used. At the near corner a longer flare
facilitates exiting from the highway and is desirable. (See Table No. 1, Plate
No. 7).
   C.   SECTION:
   Grades of all driveways abutting roads shall be in accordance with the
applicable Plate No. as noted below, for the various situations described
      1.)   Frontage Subdivision Lots Abutting Roads Without Curbs Or Sidewalks
   The driveway surface grade for all lots in subdivisions abutting County
roads without curbs or existing sidewalks, shall be constructed to conform with
the details shown on Plate No. 12-B (interior subdivision lots shall be built
in conformance with the "Rules and Regulations of the Office of the County
Engineer Governing the Surface Physical Improvements for Private Developments
Within the unincorporated Areas of Hamilton County").
   No permanent driveway permits shall be issued until the subdivision frontage
has been graded to the Hamilton County Typical Section as shown on Plate No.
12-B.
      2.)   Residential Lots (not part of a planned subdivision) Abutting Roads
Without Curbs Or Sidewalks)
   The driveway surface grade for lots abutting County roads without curbs or
sidewalks shall be constructed to conform to the details shown on Plate No. 12-
C.
      3.)   Lots Abutting On Roads With Existing Vertical Curb And Sidewalk
         a.)   Where sidewalk is two and one-half feet (2½') or more behind the
curb:
      The driveway surface at the face of curb line shall be constructed one
and one-half inches (1½") above the gutter grade. From the face of curb line,
the drive shall slope upward to existing sidewalk grade at the front face of
the walk. Across the sidewalk width and for one foot (l') beyond the back of
sidewalk, the drive slope shall conform to the existing sidewalk cross slope.
From the point one foot (1') back of the sidewalk to the right-of-way line, the
driveway slope shall (depending upon existing topography) rise at a rate no
less than one fourth inches (1/4") per foot and no greater than three-fourths
inches (3/4") per foot. (See Plate No. 9).
      The Hamilton County Engineer or his representative may grant permission,
in unusual situations, for the grade to fall at a maximum grade of three-
fourths inches (3/4") per foot from a point two foot (2') back of the sidewalk
to the right-of-way line. Permission for this variance must be requested in
writing. The grading shall in no way obstruct the required sight distance or
present conflicts for future road improvements. (See Plate No. 9).
         b.)   Where sidewalk is two and one-half feet (2½') or less behind
curb:
      In situations when there is a space between the sidewalk and back of
curb, the construction shall be performed as described in a.) above.
      In special cases where the above is not feasible and/or when the sidewalk
abuts the back of curb, the drive slope shall be constructed such as to provide
a three foot (3') minimum width of walkway area (with normal sidewalk cross
slope) along the back of the sidewalk portion of the drive.  Modification to
the existing sidewalk may be necessary to accomplish the intent of the
foregoing. In this case, the applicant is referred to Section 807 of the ODOT
Location and Design Manual. (See Plate No. 10 & 11)
      4.)   Lots Abutting On Roads With Existing Rolled Curb And Sidewalks
         a.)   Residential driveways shall ramp from the top of the existing
curb to the front face of the sidewalk and shall conform to the sidewalk cross
slope. All other provisions of Section (2) shall apply.
         b.)   Commercial driveways shall be constructed in accordance with
Plate No. 6.
      5.)   Lots Abutting On Roads With Existing Curbs (All Types), But Without
Sidewalks
         a.)   Residential driveways, which are part of a development, as
described in Sub-Section 3 (for existing vertical curbs) or Sub-Section 4. a.
(for existing roll curbs) shall be constructed with a slope upward at a rate
between one-fourth inch (1/4") and three-fourths inch (3/4") per foot to a
point five feet (5') from the right-of-way line. The slope shall rise at a rate
approximately one-fourth inch (1/4") per foot.  (See Plate No. 12-A).
Modifications to existing vertical curbs shall conform to details on Plate 5.
         b.)   Residential driveways, not part of a planned development, shall
follow the grade and abut the back of the existing curb as shown on Plate No.
12-A.  Modifications to existing vertical curb shall conform to the details on
Plate 5.
         c.)   Commercial driveways shall conform to the requirements of a.)
above, except they shall abut the back of existing roll curb as detailed on
Plate No. 6.
      6.)   Lots Abutting On Roads With Sidewalks, But Without Curbs
   Driveway aprons abutting County roads having existing sidewalks, but no
curbs, shall be constructed in accordance with the information and details
shown on Plates No. 7-A and No. 12-B.
   SECTION IV
   BARRIERS
   In cases where the private property is used for parking vehicles in a
position other than parallel to the right-of-way line, barriers shall be
located or constructed so as to prevent any part of the parked vehicles from
extending over the right-of-way line. Details of the proposed barriers shall be
shown on the permit drawings.
   SECTION V
   DRAINAGE
   A culvert of reinforced concrete, or its equivalent (as determined by the
Office of the Hamilton County Engineer) shall be installed under all driveways
constructed across existing drainage ditches or at any location where the
topography would indicate future need.  The size of the culvert shall be based
on the hydraulic requirements, but with a minimum diameter of twelve inches
(12"). Whenever feasible, new driveway culverts shall be placed a minimum of
ten feet (10') from the existing or proposed edge of pavement. In no case shall
the culvert be placed closer to the pavement than the existing ditch (or the
above noted ten feet (10'), whichever is the lesser distance) without specific
authorization by the Hamilton County Engineer's Permit Department, upon request
by the applicant.
   The driveway pipe shall be of adequate length, so that side slopes of the
driveway berms do not exceed a four to one (4:1) slope.
   If the ditch line is more than ten feet (10') from the edge of pavement, the
minimum size (diameter) culvert shall be used, but the ditch need not be
shifted closer to the road.
   Headwalls are normally prohibited along the roadway because of the hazard
they present to motorists.  However, they may be permitted by the Hamilton
County Engineer's Permit Department if special circumstances justify
installation and safety concerns are addressed.
   Approval by the Hamilton County Engineer of a permit for installation of a
culvert pipe of adequate size under present conditions does not relieve the
permit holder/property owner from the responsibility to increase the culvert
size (capacity) if necessary by later up-stream development. Such approval by
the Hamilton County Engineer of a particular size or type of culvert, to be
installed by permit, does not obligate him/her from costs of subsequent
necessary upgrading.
   For details of downspout outlets see Plate No. 27.
   SECTION VI
   PAVEMENT OPENINGS (Including
   Jacking or Tunneling)
   A.   RESPONSIBILITY:
   Within the unincorporated area of Hamilton County, no pavement and/or right-
of-way openings on a County road shall be started until a written permit on the
proper form, has been issued by the Hamilton County Engineer's Permit
Department. The permit shall be subject to the following regulations except
that in specific instances, and upon written request by the applicant, the
Hamilton County Engineer may authorize such variance from these regulations as
will not be contrary to the public interest or welfare, or where due to
conditions at the site, a literal enforcement would result in unnecessary
hardship.
   More than one pavement opening or right-of-way opening may be included on a
single application and permit form, if all are part of the same project. Should
work at the site involve other types of construction, multiple permit fees my
be required.
   The provisions of Paragraph three (3) through seven (7) of Section I-A.,
also apply to this Section.
   B.   FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS:
   Before any pavement opening permit is issued, the applicant shall deposit
with the Hamilton County Engineer's Permit Department (For payment to the
TREASURER OF HAMILTON COUNTY) a check in the amount as follows:
      Public Utilities   $10.00
      Private Utilities   $20.00
      Contractors   $20.00
   This deposit will be retained as a permit fee. If the work is not conducted
and/or completed to the satisfaction of the Hamilton County Engineer, or his
representatives the applicant will be billed for the amount of funds required
to repair the roadway to a satisfactory condition as determined by the Hamilton
County Engineer.
   C.   ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS:
   1.)   For all underground installations the applicants will be required to
employ boring, jacking or tunneling methods whenever feasible for short
longitudinal and all lateral installations. Permits for open cuts will be
issued for such situations only after the applicant has satisfied the Hamilton
County Permit Department that this method is the only feasible alternative.
   2.)   The application for a permit to make longitudinal cuts within the
roadway, or within three feet (3') of the edge of the roadway, shall be
accompanied by a detailed plan in triplicate showing all of the proposed
construction affecting traffic movements and shall include any or all of the
following items that are applicable to the project:
      a.)   Dimensional information relative to the exact location of the cut
along the highway, street address, north point, scale of drawing and distance
to nearest street intersection or section line.
      b.)   Property lines, right-of-way lines, and the dimensions thereof.
      c.)   Distance between edge of pavement and right-of-way line (edge of
pavement is actual edge of the pavement structure).
      d.)   Street inlets and all public utility structures which may affect
said installation.
      e.)   Location and description of existing and proposed drainage
structures within highway right-of-way, including invert elevations, pipe
sizes, and pipe grades.
      f.)   For cuts deeper than four feet (4') below the surface, the
applicant shall supply, as part of the applications details of bracing to be
installed to protect the excavation. In those instances where cuts will be
deeper than eight feet (8') calculations, prepared and sealed by a Professional
Engineer, experienced in designs of this type, registered to practice in the
State of Ohio, shall accompany the drawings.
   The intent of this requirement is to ensure that the permit applicant and
his/her excavator (if not the same) shall make definite plans for (including
having readily available to the work site all the necessary materials,
equipment and labor) the protection of the pavement structure adjacent to the
excavation.
   It is not the intent that this requirement replace, supersede, or interfere
with any of the rules, requirements or regulations of any agencies concerned
with the health, safety or welfare of individuals present at the site.  (It
shall be the responsibility of the applicant to ascertain and abide by the
requirements of the appropriate agencies having rules and regulations regarding
health, safety and welfare at/on construction sites.)
      g.)   Such other information as may be reasonably necessary to determine
the exact nature and extent of the work.
   3.)   The application for a permit to make lateral cuts within the roadway,
or jack, or tunnel under said roadway, shall require a detailed plan only upon
request of the Hamilton County Engineer or his representative.
   D.   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   Upon receipt of the application and the required monetary deposit) a field
review will be conducted at the location and checks made to determine if future
road improvements are planned. All applications for permits shall be dated upon
receipt. The necessary review will be made as soon thereafter as practicable.
If the application and proposed work is found to be acceptable, the permit will
be issued.  In the event that corrections or modifications are deemed
necessary, the applicant will be so notified, and a copy of the plan marked as
appropriate, shall be returned to the applicant.  The applicant, after making
the necessary changes to the original drawing, shall re-submit the same number
that was required for the original submission. The Hamilton County Engineer's
Permit Department will then reprocess the application and issue the permit, if
the required changes were made. Revised plans, which are re-submitted shall be
marked as "revised" with the date of revision noted thereon near the drawing
title.
   The Hamilton County Engineer, through his representative in the Permit
Department can require the permit holder to take and perform measures that will
maintain stability of existing slopes, existing roadway drainage and existing
erosion containment. When required, the permit shall be issued on the condition
that the restoration procedures and methods specifically address these
concerns. The above noted matters, when anticipated, shall be addressed on the
items submitted with the application and must also be addressed when
encountered at the site of the permit work.
   Slope stability, roadway drainage and erosion containment methods may
include, but are not limited to, any or all of the following:
      1.)   Construction of berms, ditches and/or curbs where none were
present.
      2.)   Planting of shrubs, vegetative materials and installation of
erosion control features.
      3.)   The obtaining of easements for slope grade reduction.
   Costs of these operations shall be the responsibility of the permit holder.
Restoration, necessitated by future failures, caused by the permit work, shall
also be the responsibility of the permit holder.
   Each permit shall have stated on its face the period of time for which it is
valid and said permit must be on hand at the job site. The maximum period of
validity shall be one (1) year. Should this time period expire prior to
satisfactory completion of the work, the applicant shall apply for a new permit
and pay another fee. It is also required that the permit holder notify the
Hamilton County Engineer's Permit Department forty eight (48) hours in advance
of the day on which the work will begin and the anticipated time of completion.
   Whenever possible, underground facilities installed under authority of
permits shall have a minimum cover of three feet (3'). It shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to investigate the site and coordinate the
proposed installation with previously installed items (by others).
   During the progress of the work, adequate protection and passage shall be
provided by the permit holder for the traveling public.  All devices, including
installation of same, and procedures, shall be in accordance with the ODOT
Manual of Traffic Control for Construction and Maintenance Operations. Not more
than one-half (½) of the traveled roadway shall be closed at one time and
temporary or permanent pavement restoration shall be completed before the other
one-half (½) of the roadway is closed. (For type of restoration, see Plates No.
13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18). This restoration can be made by plating the opening
if the Contractor and Inspector are in agreement as to details. See Plate No.
30 for plate details.
   All openings shall be backfilled and temporarily or permanently restored as
soon as good construction practices permit. Any opening left unattended during
the course of the work shall be temporarily restored as required in the
preceding paragraph. However, longitudinal openings of major proportion may be
left unattended provided that protection is afforded by use of barricades,
lights, flashers, advance warning signs, etc. (All provided, installed and
maintained in accordance with the pertinent provisions of the Ohio Manual of
Traffic Control for Construction and Maintenance Operations) and the Hamilton
County Engineer's Office notified prior to this procedure being put into effect
at the site.
   The provisions of the preceding paragraph may not apply for restricted
roads. The determination of a restricted road is made on the basis of several
factors including, but not limited to, traffic volume, peak traffic periods,
geometrics, emergency routes, school bus routes (and schedules) and other
factors considered pertinent by the Hamilton County Engineer or his
representative. Time periods during which traffic lanes shall be restored to
full width will be listed on the permit.  Permits issued for work on restricted
roads will have stamped thereon "RESTRICTED".
   Trench backfill below subgrade level for all trenches in or within two feet
(2') of the edge of pavement and paved berms shall consist of flowable
controlled density fill.  Specifications, including proportions of the fill
mixture, delivery equipment and placing/curing requirements are included in
this manual as Addendum "A".
   Should the requirements of the preceding paragraph above become cause for a
potential hazard which can be demonstrated, the Hamilton County Engineer
reserves the right to make modifications. However, this will be done only upon
application on writing, which application shall include sufficient information
to aid in making a determination of the potential for hazard.  Any permitted
modifications shall be in writing (by the Hamilton County Engineer) and may
include other engineering and/or construction requirements not listed in this
manual.
   Trench backfill for areas outside the limits described in the preceding
paragraph shall consist of the materials referred to above or shall consist of
compacted layers four inches (4") maximum of granular materials conforming to
Ohio Department of Transportation "Construction & Materials Specifications",
Section
310.02, Gradation A, if the backfill is to support driveways or sidewalks or
may consist of compacted layers four inches (4") maximum of the excavated
materials if the surface is unimproved. The thickness of the compacted layers
noted above may be increased to twelve inches (12") when a high capacity
mechanical tamper is used. (Manufacturer's specifications will be acceptable in
defining a "high capacity mechanical tamper").  It shall be the responsibility
of the permit applicant to protect restoration work until materials have cured
sufficiently to accommodate traffic (both vehicular and pedestrian).
   The Hamilton County Engineer reserves the right to require work, as he deems
appropriate. (including full width overlay), to correct damage to the existing
pavement structure or surface, outside the pavement opening limits, which are
attributable to the work covered by the permit.
   Permanent restoration of all areas outside the edge of pavement shall be
performed in accordance with Plates No. 19 through 26.
   No materials shall be stored where it will interfere with the normal flow of
traffic. In the event the highway becomes damaged because of said construction,
the party or parties to whom this permit is granted shall promptly restore said
highway to its former condition.
   If it becomes necessary to open the trench at some future date for repairs
or removal of structures, a new permit will be required.
   Except as herein authorized, no excavation shall be made or obstacles placed
within the limits of the highway in such manner as to interfere necessarily
with the travel over the highway.
   Except as herein provided, all materials and methods used for backfill of
trenches and restorations of pavements shall meet the requirements of the
current edition of the State of Ohio Department of Transportation "Construction
and Materials Specifications". The permit holder should in particular be aware
of the latter publication's requirements for compaction of trench backfill,
granular pavement bases and pavement materials, and for maximum slumps for and
vibration of portland cement concrete.
   The Hamilton County Engineer reserves the right, on major projects or in
critical areas or circumstances, to require testing.  Such testing may include
trench backfill density, subgrade compaction and concrete slump, air
entrainment and strength.  Testing shall be performed by an approved
independent testing firm and written results shall be provided to the Hamilton
County Engineer's Permit Department. Costs of any required testing shall be the
responsibility of the applicant.
   The granting of this permit does not in any way abridge the right of the
Hamilton County Engineer in his jurisdiction over the County roads. If, in the
process of any future work or for the benefit of the traveling public it
becomes necessary, in the opinion of the County Engineer to order the removal,
reconstruction, relocation or repair of any of the fixtures, or work performed
under this permit, the removal, reconstruction, relocation or repairs shall be
wholly at the expense of the owners thereof, and be made as directed by the
County Engineer.
   These regulations shall supersede all other governing factors for all
matters concerning pavement openings within the County road right-of-way.
   The right is reserved, during the time any or all of the work is being
performed, to appoint an inspector over the work who shall represent the
interest of the County.
   All the work herein contemplated shall be done under the supervision and to
the satisfaction of the Hamilton County Engineer, and the entire expense
thereof, shall be borne by the party or parties to whom the permit is issued.
   Failure by the applicants or his agent, to comply with any of the above will
be cause for revocation of the permit.
   SECTION VII
   EXCAVATION AND EMBANKMENT ON THE PUBLIC HIGHWAY
   RIGHT-OF-WAY (Including all
   Cuts and Fills)
   Within the unincorporated area of Hamilton County no excavation/embankment
operations within the public right-of-way of County roads shall be started
until a written permit, on the proper form, has been issued by the Hamilton
County Engineer's Permit Department.  The permit shall be subject to the
following regulations except that in specific instances and upon written
request by the applicant, the Hamilton County Engineer may authorize such
variance from these regulations as will not be contrary to the public interest
or welfare, or where due to conditions at the site, a literal enforcement would
result in unnecessary hardship.
   The provisions of Section I. A., paragraphs three (3) through seven (7),
Section 1. D., paragraphs One (1) through four (4) and Sec. VI. D., paragraphs
two (2), three (3) and four (4) shall also apply to this Section.
   Before any permits are issued which cover excavations/embankments within the
right-of-way, the applicant shall deposit with the Hamilton County Engineer's
Permit Department (for payment to the TREASURER OF HAMILTON COUNTY) a check in
the amount as follows:
      Public Utilities   $10.00
      Private Utilities   $20.00
      Contractors   $20.00
   This deposit will be retained as a permit fee. If the work is not conducted
and/or completed to the satisfaction of the Hamilton County Engineer, or his
representatives the applicant will be billed for the amount of funds required
to repair the roadway to a satisfactory condition as determined by the Hamilton
County Engineer. However, in the case of proposed excavations which might
jeopardize the integrity of the pavement or abutting property, the Hamilton
County Engineer reserves the right to require submittal of sheeting and bracing
plans, (including calculations) which are designed to protect the excavation.
   For residential and/or commercial developments abutting Hamilton County
roads, in addition to the driveway requirements discussed previously in this
manual, the developer shall carry out and complete the work in conformance with
the applicable requirements of plates No. 12, 12-A and 12-B of this manual
(excluding drive profiles).
   For typical Section for Pavement Widening see plates No. 28 and 29.
   SECTION VIII
   PUBLIC UTILITY WORK
   A.   In general, permits will be required, but without fee for the
following:
   1.)   Pole replacement when the poles are reset in the same location as part
of a regular maintenance program. Same location in this instance is considered
to include changes parallel with the pavement centerline of up to three linear
feet (3 1.F.).
   2.)   Guy wire renewals.
   3.)   Water or gas service branch curb box replacements.
   4.)   Any utility relocation caused by a County or other governmental agency
road improvement.
   B.   In general, permits will be required and fees charged for relocations
and/or rebuilding or utility facilities.
   C.   When it becomes necessary to relocate or rebuild utility facilities
which are within County road right-of-way, the utility shall make every effort
to locate same outside the pavement and as close to the right-of-way line as
feasible.
   SECTION IX
   REQUIRED SIDEWALK/DRIVEWAY REPAIRS
   The Office of the Hamilton County Engineer is required to inspect sidewalks
and included driveway aprons along County roads on a scheduled basis or in
response to a complaint. Property owners are responsible for necessary repairs
which may be performed by them or their Contractor under a permit issued by the
Hamilton County Engineer's Office.
   Details regarding this are listed in the "Hamilton County Engineer's
Sidewalk Policy".
   ADDENDUM "A"
   HAMILTON COUNTY ENGINEER'S PERMIT MANUAL
   ITEM SPECIAL - FLOWABLE CONTROLLED DENSITY FILL:
   A.)   DESCRIPTION - This work shall consist of furnishing and placing of a
flowable mixture of Portland cement, fly ash and sand for backfilling trenches
under various combinations of pavement within public right-of-way or other
locations as shown on the plans or as specified. The materials as proportioned
below shall not be used as structure backfill for aluminum or aluminum coated
pipes.
   B.)   MATERIALS:
   1)   Cement - - - 701.01 or 701.04 as listed in O.D.O.T. Construction &
Material Specifications.
   2)   Fly Ash - - - Shall meet A.S.T.M. C-618, Class C or Class F except that
requirements for moisture and pozzolanic activity are waived for Class F fly
ash and loss-on-ignition (1.O.I.) shall not exceed 12% for Class F fly ash. Fly
ash shall come from a source approved by the Hamilton County Engineer.
   3)   Fine aggregate shall be natural, recycled, or manufactured sand
manufactured from stone, gravel or air cooled slag. The gradation of the sand
shall meet the requirements of O.D.O.T. C. & M.S. 703.05 unless otherwise
approved in writing by the Hamilton Country Engineer.
   4)   Water used for the mixture shall be free from oil, salts, acid, strong
alkalis, vegetable matter, and other impurities that would have an adverse
effect on the quality of the backfill material.
   5)   The mix design, including manufactured sand shall be evaluated as non-
corrosive by ASTM-674.
   6)   Polyethylene encasement - ASTM-674-84.
   C.)   COMPATIBILITY WITH DUCTILE IRON PIPE - Should the mix design not meet
the requirements of Section B-5 above, or in lieu of testing, the mix design in
accordance with the requirements of Section B-5 (ASTM-674), then to ensure
compatibility with ductile iron pipe, a polyethylene encasement shall be
required conforming to ASTM A-674-84.
   D.)   MIX PROPORTIONING - The initial trial mixture shall consist of the
following quantities of materials per cubic yard:
 
                 Type I   Type II  Type III Type IV    Type V
Cement           100 lbs  50 lbs   100 lbs  0 lbs      0 lbs
Fly Ash, Class F 250 lbs  250 lbs  2000 lbs **1500 lbs 0 lbs
Fly Ash, Class C 0 lbs    0 lbs    0 lbs    500 lbs    400 lbs
Sand (SSD)*      2850 lbs 2910 lbs 0 lbs    0 lbs      2930 lbs
Air              3 oz     0        0        0          0
Water (Maximum)  500 lbs  500 lbs  725 lbs  850 lbs    430 lbs
 
   *Saturated surface dry
   **or other aggregate fill, as approved by the Hamilton County Engineer
   These quantities of materials are expected to yield approximately 1 cubic
yard of mixture of a flowable consistency. The proportioning of materials shall
be the responsibility of the Contractor.  Adjustments of the proportions shall
be based on maintaining the total absolute volume and proportioning shall
insure that unconfined compressive strength at 90 days does not exceed 150
P.S.I. (10.8 T.S.F.). The minimum unconfined compressive strength shall not be
less than 50 P.S.I. (3.6 T. S.F.). The Contractor may be required to provide
test data from a laboratory or testing firm (such laboratory or firm to be
approved by the Hamilton County Engineer) demonstrating that the proposed
proportioning will meet the strength limitations listed above.
   E.)   MIX ADJUSTMENTS - To expedite consolidation of Type I or Type II
mixtures as defined in Section D above, it will be necessary for bleed water to
appear on the surface immediately after the mixture is "struck off". A delay in
bleeding is an indication of too many fines in the mixture. In this case, the
fly ash quantity shall be reduced in increments of 50 lbs. until the mixture is
bleeding freely. Approximately 60 lbs. of sand shall be added to replace each
50 lbs. increment of fly ash in order to maintain yield.
   To produce a flowable mix it may be necessary to produce one or more one
cubic yard trial batches at different water contents. The mixture shall be
considered too dry if cracks develop in the mixture as it flows into place.
   F.)   FLOW TEST - A test for proper flow consists of filling a 3 inch
diameter by 6 inch high open ended cylinder, placed on a smooth non-porous
level surface, to the top (struck level) with flowable mixture. Within 5
seconds of filling/striking the cylinder shall be pulled straight up. The
resulting spread material shall have a diameter of at least 8 inches (except
for Types IV and V).
   G.)   PUMPING - The mixes proportioned by Types I and II may not be
pumpable.  If the Contractor elects to pump the flowable mixture, fly ash may
be added up to a maximum content of 750 lbs. Fine aggregates shall be reduced
to maintain absolute volume of the.mixture.
   H.)   FCDF; FAST SETTING TYPE IV AND V - The initial mixture shall be as
specified in Section D above.
   Fast Setting Mixture may be used elsewhere, but shall be used as directed by
the Hamilton County Engineer for backfilling trenches under pavement within the
public right-of-way when it is deemed that the pavement must be quickly
reopened to traffic so as to minimize inconvenience to vehicular traffic or as
shown on the plans. The use of FCDF Fast Setting Mixture is intended to allow
for placement of an asphaltic concrete pavement within four hours after mixture
placement. FCDF Fast Setting Mixture shall meet the compressive strength
requirements as included in Section D above.
   I.)   MIXING EQUIPMENT - Sufficient mixing capacity and delivery equipment
shall be provided to permit the FCDF mixture to be placed without interruption
as much as practical.  FCDF mixtures may be placed in intermittent horizontal
lifts as approved by the Hamilton County Engineer.
   Delivery equipment shall be as follows:
   1.)   Type I and Type II mixtures shall be delivered and placed from ready
mixed concrete trucks or volumetric mobile mixers.  These mixtures may be
pumped if modified as described in Section G above.
   2.)   Type III mixtures may be delivered and placed from dump trucks, ready
mixed concrete trucks, volumetric mobile mixers, conveyor lines or pumping.
   3.)   Type IV and Type V mixtures shall be delivered and placed from
volumetric mobile mixers. Volumetric mixers shall be calibrated so as to
combine the mix materials in accordance with the proportions listed in Section
D above and to sufficiently mix the combined materials to obtain a uniform
mixture meeting the requirements of these specifications.
   J.)   PLACING MIXTURES - FCDF mixtures shall be discharged from the mixing
and/or delivery equipment by any reasonable means into the space to be filled.
The fill material shall be brought up uniformly to the lines or limits shown on
the plans or as directed by the Engineer. Placing of other materials over the
low strength mortar backfill may commence as specified herein, as soon as the
surface water has dissipated, or as directed by the Engineer.
   For Types I, II and III mixtures, the placing of portland cement concrete
pavements can be performed when all surface water has dissipated.  The placing
of asphaltic concrete pavements over these same three (3) type mixtures shall
not occur until a minimum of 24 hours has elapsed following placing of the
backfill.
   For Types IV and V mixtures, the placing of portland cement concrete
pavements can be performed one (1) hour after the backfill has been placed. The
placing of asphaltic concrete pavement over the same mixtures shall not occur
until a minimum of 4 hours has elapsed following placing of the backfill unless
a pentrometer test in accordance with ASTM C403-88 indicates average resistance
strength of 400 P.S.I. in less time.
   K.)   LIMITATION OF OPERATIONS
   1.)   The mixtures shall not be placed on frozen ground.
   2.)   The placed mixtures shall be protected from freezing.
   3.)   Each filling stage shall be as continuous as possible.
   4.)   Curing time of FCDF may be affected by temperature. At temperatures
near freezing or below, additional time may be needed for proper cure of the
material prior to any type of paving operation.
   L.)   APPROVAL OF ALTERNATE MATERIALS - Manufacturers or suppliers of
materials other than those approved by the Hamilton County Engineer and as
indicated by these specifications may request owner's material be added as an
approved equal through the Hamilton County Engineer. Any such requests shall be
in writing and shall include sufficient data, results of field and laboratory
tests, source of supply, quantity available, etc. to enable a reasonable
consideration to be made of the request.

(Ord. 19-56. Passed 3-6-56.)
1040.06  FRAUDULENT USE OF NAME.

relating to the restoration of streets and sidewalks.
(Ord. 19-56. Passed 3-6-56.)
1040.08  NONLIABILITY OF VILLAGE.
   Every permit to make a connection with a sewer shall be granted subject to

in consideration of the privilege thereby granted and enjoyed, save and hold
the Village harmless of any loss or damage which may in any way result from or
be occasioned by the installation or maintenance of such sewer connection.

After the sewer is laid and before it is covered or used, it shall be inspected
and approved by the Building Commissioner or his authorized agent.
(Ord. 9-55. Passed 4-5-55.)
   (b)   No sewer connection from any building or premises shall be less than

uncovered, free and clear until it is inspected and approved by an inspector.
(Ord. 19-56. Passed 3-6-56.)
1040.11  PROPERTY OWNER RESPONSIBLE FOR PRIVATE SEWER CONNECTION.
   Every property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance and good
condition of any lateral sewer branch connecting his premises with a Village
sewer or other sewer except that where part of such lateral branch within the
limits of a dedicated street has been laid under public contract as part of a
street paving improvement, or has been laid by private contract in connection
with a street paving improvement under Village supervision and inspection, and
is later found to have been improperly constructed, the Village shall, at its
own expense, make the necessary repair or reconstruction of such lateral branch
or part thereof and correct the condItion caused by the improper construction. 
In the event that by reason of a defective private sewer connection, damage
shall be occasioned to a Village street or to street or sidewalk paving, the
Building Commissioner shall notify the property owner to take immediate steps
to repair the defect and damage.  Upon receipt of the notice, the property
owner or his representative shall apply for the necessary permit and shall make
a deposit in the amount required for the making of a street opening. If the
property owner fails, within seven days after the issue of notice, to make the
required application for a street opening permit, the Village shall undertake
the work of repairing the sewer connection and restoring the street and
pavement, and shall charge the cost thereof, including permit fee, to the
owner.  Notice required by this section may be served on the property owner
personally, by mail, or by delivery to any occupying lessee or tenant if the
owner does not reside on the premises.
(Ord. 19-56. Passed 3-6-56.)
1040.12  BREAKING OR REMOVING SEWERS.
   No person shall injure, break or remove any part of any receiving basin,
covering plate, manhole cover or any part of any sewer or appurtenance thereto,
except as duly authorized in the course of making an improvement, repair or
sewer connection.
(Ord. 19-56. Passed 3-6-56.)
1040.13  DEPOSITING OBSTRUCTIVE REFUSE IN SEWERS PROHIBITED.
   No person shall deposit the carcass of a dead animal, or part thereof,
butcher's offal or refuse of any kind liable to become an obstruction, in any
sewer, receiving basin, tributary watercourse or other place from which it may
be carried or washed into a sewer, or cause or permit such refuse matter to be
so deposited.  No person shall deposit any such refuse matter in any place
where it will obstruct the mouth of a sewer or a drain or deposit it in any
other place in violation of instructions duly posted prohibiting such deposit.
(Ord. 19-56. Passed 3-6-56.)
1040.14  OBSTRUCTING DRAINAGE BY DUMPING.
   No owner of a tract of land shall dump or allow to be dumped thereon
material of any kind in such manner as to interfere with existing drains,
sewers or natural watercourses. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
prohibit the filling of abandoned cellars, cisterns or other cavities not
involving sewerage or drainage.
(Ord. 19-56. Passed 3-6-56.)
1040.15  NOTICE TO REMOVE DRAINAGE OBSTRUCTIONS.
   Whenever the Mayor finds that, by reason of the making of a fill or partial
fill thereon, a tract of land is inadequately drained, or that such fill
obstructs or interferes with lawfully existing sewerage or drainage, he shall
notify the owner of such tract to remove the fill or to provide the necessary
sewerage or drainage to eliminate the obstruction. Such notice may be served
upon the owner by personal delivery, by mail at his last known place of
residence or by posting on the premises. Failure, after such notice, to remove
the fill or to provide the necessary sewerage or drainage shall constitute an
unlawful act, if continued for a period of ten days.  A separate offense shall
be deemed committed each ten day period during which the owner fails to carry
out the order of the Mayor.
(Ord. 19-56. Passed 3-6-56.)
1040.16  ELIMINATION OF OBSTRUCTIONS BY VILLAGE.
   In case of an emergency or in any case where an obstruction caused by a fill
or partial fill has continued for more than thirty days after the serving of
notice in accordance with Section
1040.15, the Mayor shall be authorized to cause any necessary measures to be
taken to protect existing drainage systems, and to charge the expense thereof
to the owner of the property on which the obstructing fill was made.  This
section shall not be construed to relieve the owner of any penalties prescribed
by other sections of this chapter.
(Ord. 19-56. Passed 3-6-56.)
1040.17  PERMITS FOR DUMPING.
   Any property owner desiring to fill or partially fill a tract of land owned
by him, may, before making such flu, apply to the Building Commissioner for a
permit authorizing the same to be made, stating in his application, the
location of the tract and the nature and the dimensions of the fill proposed. 
If the Building Commissioner is satisfied that the proposed fill will not
interfere with adequate drainage for the area to be filled and will not
obstruct or interfere with lawfully existing sewerage or drainage, public or
private, or cause ponds of stagnant water to form, he shall issue a permit
authorizing the fill.
(Ord. 19-56. Passed 3-6-56.)
1040.18  SEWER ASSESSMENTS TO BE PAID BEFORE ISSUING PERMIT.
   Whenever an application is made for a permit to connect private premises
with a sewer, the Mayor shall ascertain whether the installation of such sewer
was financed, in whole or in part, by an assessment or other system of public
charges on abutting property or on a benefited district.  If the sewer is found
to have been so financed, no permit shall be issued to connect any premises
therewith, unless and until all sewer assessments or charges assessed against
the premises, or equivalent charges, have been paid or secured to be paid.
(Ord. 19-56. Passed 3-6-56.)
1040.19  STATUTORY ASSESSMENTS.
   Where an assessment has been duly levied against the premises applied for,
in accordance with the statutes of the Ohio Revised Code, no permit shall be
issued unless the owner of the premises, as a condition of receiving his
permit, waives In writing all objections to the validity and amount of the
assessment.
(Ord. 19-56.  Passed 3-6-56.)
1040.20  DEFERRED ASSESSMENTS.
   If, as to any premises, Council has imposed a deferred assessment for a
sewer improvement, payable only ff and when a sewer permit is applied for to
connect such premises, no permit for' sewer connection shall be issued until
either such deferred assessment has been paid in full or payment has otherwise
been made or provided for in accordance with law.  If payment is not made in
full, the permittee shall waive all objections to the validity and amount of
the assessment.  Payment of deferred assessments and of equivalent charges
referred to in Section
1040.21 may be made by extension on the tax duplicate.
(Ord. 19-56. Passed 3-6-56.)
1040.21  COLLECTION OF EQUIVALENT CHARGE.
   Where Council has imposed neither a regular assessment nor a deferred
assessment against premises abutting a sewer or through which a sewer runs, or
included in a benefited sewer district, on the claim or belief that the sewer
would not be available for, or of benefit to, the premises, or for any other
reason including the layIng of such sewer by general taxation, and an easement
for such sewer on and across the premises has been given, without cost, to the
Village, then a permit to connect such premises with such sewer shall be issued
upon payment of the prescribed permit fee, subject to the express condition
that the owner of the premises for himself and every succeeding owner shall
thereby waive all objections to any assessment against such premises for any
sewer thereafter constructed.  Where an application for a permit is made for
premises with respect to which no such easement has been given, then a charge
shall be determined on the basis of four dollars ($4.00) per front foot, which
shall have the same status as the deferred charge referred to in Section
1040.20, and no such permit shall be issued until such equivalent charge and
the prescribed permit fee have been paid or secured to be paid.
(Ord. 19-56. Passed 3-6-56.)
1040.22  POWERS OF BUILDING COMMISSIONER.
   The Building Commissioner is authorized and directed to adopt and enforce
specifications and regulations in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter for the purpose of providing control of the installation of sewer
connections and inspection thereof.  The Building Commissioner shall maintain
accurate and complete records of all permits issued for and inspections made of
the construction of house sewers and connections to the public sewers. He shall
also require the abandonment and removal of connections to the public sewers
which violate the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 9-55. Passed 4-5-55.)
1040.99  PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).

1042.01  DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Normal sewage" means sewage which when analyzed shows by weight a
daily average of not more than 2,500 pounds, i.e. 300 parts per million, of
suspended solids; not more than 2,000 pounds, i.e. 240 parts per million, of
B.O.D.; and not more than 833 pounds, i.e. 100 parts per million, of ether-
soluble matter, i.e. grease and oil, each per million gallons of daily flow.
   (b)   "Suspended solids" means solids that either float on the surface of,
or are in suspension in water, sewage or other liquids, and which are removable
by laboratory filtering.
   (c)   "B.O.D." (biochemical oxygen demand) means the quantity of oxygen
utilized in the biochemical oxidation of organic matter, under standard
laboratory procedure in five days at twenty degrees Centigrade (sixty-eight
Fahrenheit) expressed in parts per million by weight.
1042.02  RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The City Manager of Cincinnati shall make and enforce rules and regulations
establishing the types and characteristics of sewage, industrial wastes and
other matter which shall not be discharged into the Cincinnati Metropolitan
Sewerage System; the types and characteristics of sewage and industrial wastes
admissible to the Cincinnati Metropolitan Sewerage System only after
pretreatment; and otherwise governing the discharge of sewage, industrial
wastes and other matter into the Cincinnati Metropolitan Sewerage System in the
interest of the safe and efficient operation of the system.
(Ord. 6-53. Passed 5-8-53.)
1042.03  APPEALS.
   If the findings, order or decision of the Cincinnati City Manager made
pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or the rules and regulations
described in Section
1042.02 are not acceptable to any industry, such industry shall have the right
to appeal as follows: two reputable and competent engineers shall be chosen,
one by the industry and the other by the City, neither of whom shall be a
regular employee of either principal.  Such persons shall act as referees.  As
soon as such referees are chosen, the City Manager of Cincinnati shall file
with them a certified copy of the complaint and the decision of the City
Manager of Cincinnati, and it shall be the duty of such referees to investigate
the complaint and to agree either to affirm or reject the findings of the City
Manager of Cincinnati and file a report with the City Council of Cincinnati
within a reasonable time, setting down their decision.  If the referees so
chosen are unable to agree, they shall choose a third engineer of like
standing, and the decision or recommendation of the majority shall be reported
to the City Council of Cincinnati.  The decision or ruling of the City Council
of Cincinnati shall be final and shall be reported to the industry, to the City
Manager of Cincinnati and to the Evendale Council.
   The fees and expenses of the referee appointed by the industry shall be paid
by the industry and the fees and expenses of the referee appointed by the City
shall be paid from funds appropriated by the City Council of Cincinnati for
such purposes from the surcharge collections.  The fees and expenses of the
third referee shall be equally divided between the industry and the City.
(Ord. 6-53. Passed 5-8-53.)
1042.04  BASIS FOR SURCHARGE.
   There is hereby charged to each lot, parcel of land, building or premises
discharging sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquid, other than normal
sewage, either into the Metropolitan Sewerage System, into a stream or in a
manner contrary to law, the surcharge established herein in addition to the
charge now or hereafter fixed for normal sewage.
   The basis of the surcharge shall be determined on either or both of two
constituents of the water or wastes:
   (a)   Total suspended solids and/or
   (b)   B.O.D. five days at twenty degrees Centigrade and as herein provided.
   When either or both the total suspended solids and B.O.D. of a water or
waste accepted for admission to the City sewage works exceeds the values of
these constituents for normal sewage, the excess concentration in either or
both, as the case may be, shall be evaluated volumetrically in terms of normal
sewage and be subject to surcharge on the volume derived in accordance with the
following formula:
   Sv=  Sw-2500 x 0.65  x F x 133,690
         2500
   plus (Bw-2000) x 0.65  x F x 133,690
         2000
which reduced to its simplest form is
      Sv=F (  (Sw-2500) 35 plus
      (Bw-2000)  43).
where Sv is the derived volume of wastes in cubic feet subject to surcharge.
   Sw means the pounds per million gallons of suspended solids in the wastes as
discharged
2,500 is the pounds per million gallons of suspended solids in the normal
sewage.
   Bw means the pounds per million gallons of B.O.D. in the wastes as
discharged.
2000 is the pounds per million gallons of B.O.D. in normal sewage.
0.65 means the factor allowance for a 65% degree of purification.
(The present B.O.D. requirement for the Cincinnati Pool was established by the
Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission.).
   F means the flow expressed in million gallons of the wastes as discharged.
133,690 is the factor to convert million gallons to cubic feet.
   The equivalent volume of normal sewage as derived from the excess above the
normal strength of any water and wastes shall be subject to a surcharge for the
volume of equivalent normal sewage as computed from the formula, at a flat rate
of three cents ($.03) for each 100 cubic feet, as above computed.
(Ord. 6-53. Passed 5-8-53.)
1042.05  PRIVATE SEWAGE TREATMENT FACILITIES.
   Where an industry or other waste producer now discharging any sewage or
wastes into a stream or otherwise disposing of such sewage or wastes contrary
to law, contemplates providing its own proper facilities for the treatment of
its sewage or wastes instead of utilizing the Cincinnati Metropolitan Sewerage
System, such industry or producer can, by special agreement with the City of
Cincinnati entered into within six months after the effective date of this
chapter (Ordinance 6-53, passed May 8, 1953), bind itself to construct its own
proper facilities for the treatment of its sewage and wastes within twelve
months after the date the collection of the sewerage surcharge becomes
effective.  If any such industry or waste producer provides satisfactory
treatment facilities within the prescribed time, it shall be entitled to a
refund of any sewerage service charges or surcharges paid by it.
(Ord. 6-53. Passed 5-8-53.)
1042.06  PRIVATE PRETREATMENT FACILITIES.
   Where an industry now, or hereafter, discharging any wastes into a sewer
connected to the Cincinnati Metropolitan Sewerage System contemplates providing
facilities for pretreatment of such wastes so as to reduce the strength of such
wastes, the industry can, by special agreement with the City of Cincinnati
entered into within six months after the effective date of this chapter
(Ordinance 6-53, passed May 8, 1953), bind itself to construct such
pretreatment facilities within twelve months after the date the collection of
the sewerage surcharge becomes effective.  If any industry provides
satisfactory pretreatment within the prescribed time, it shall be entitled to a
refund in an amount equal to the difference between the surcharge actually paid
and the surcharge that would have been paid had its pretreatment facilities
been in operation on the date the sewerage surcharge went into effect.
(Ord. 6-53. Passed 5-8-53.)
1042.07  CHANGES IN SURCHARGE RATE.
   In order to maintain solvency and equity in the surcharge revenue fund, the
sewerage surcharge rate may be raised or lowered upon recommendation of the
City Manager of Cincinnati based upon supporting data and with proper
allocation of the various factors involved. However, before a change in the
rate can be made effective, it shall be ordained by Evendale Council.
(Ord. 6-53. Passed 5-8-53.)
1042.08  VIOLATION.
   Where the sewerage surcharge established in this chapter is not paid or the
rules and regulations promulgated by the City Manager of Cincinnati pursuant to
this chapter are not complied with, the City Manager of Cincinnati shall have
the right to shut off the water supply or to remove or close sewer connections
or both until payment is made or the rules and regulations of the City Manager
are complied with.
(Ord. 6-53. Passed 5-8-53.)
1042.09  EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHAPTER.
   The surcharge for sewerage service established herein shall start and be
made applicable on all sewer accounts on or about the date of awarding the
first contract in connection with the Millcreek Sewage Works.
(Ord. 6-53. Passed 5-8-53.)

1046.04  PROCEDURES FOR WORK IN AND ON THE VILLAGE WATER AND FIRE HYDRANT
SYSTEM.
   (a)   On the recommendation of the Fire Chief and the Safety Committee, the
procedures set forth in subsection (c) hereof are hereby adopted to govern work
in and on the Village water and fire hydrant system.
   (b)   Any deposits required by subsection (c) hereof shall be payable to the
Village and deposited with the Village Clerk, who shall hold the same until
notified in writing by the Fire Chief that such deposits shall be returned or
forfeited into the General Fund.
   (c)   The procedures to be followed by a contractor when it is necessary to
shut down a water main or fire hydrant for repairs, alterations or other
reasons in the Village are as follows:
      (1)   When the project is being engineered, a representative from the
contracting firm shall meet with the Fire Chief, for the purpose of discussing
and coordinating what areas are to be shut down, what dates and times are
involved, what valves will be closed and related matters.
      (2)   On the date the work is to be done, a representative of the
contractor shall come to the Fire Station and pay a one hundred dollar
($100.00) deposit for each hydrant that is out of service.
      (3)   Upon placing the fire hydrant back into service, the contractor
shall notify the fire officer in charge. The contractor shall then accompany
the fire officer to the hydrant and flow water from the hydrant before the one
hundred dollar ($100.00) deposit returned.
      (4)   A failure to comply with any of the provisions of this section
shall cause the contractor to forfeit the one hundred dollar ($100.00) deposit
per fire hydrant, and to be liable for any and all damages to the hydrant or
property as a result of noncompliance.
      (5)   A Cincinnati Water Works temporary use permit is not a license to
use a fire hydrant; it permits only the use of the water. A fire hydrant
license, or permission to use the hydrant, must be obtained from the Evendale
Fire Department, 10500 Reading Road, Evendale, Ohio 45241, which has
jurisdiction over the fire hydrant.

Cincinnati Water Works to obtain a temporary use permit and be required to
notify the Evendale Fire Department of that temporary use permit number.
      (8)   No wrench other than the fire hydrant wrench issued by the Fire
Department shall be used, unless approved by the Fire Chief. Any one using
another hydrant wrench other than that which was issued and approved by the
Evendale Fire Department shall have their permit revoked, and be subject to
legal action.
      (9)   Any person wishing to use a fire hydrant should anticipate such
need and contact the Fire Department as early as possible.
      (10)   Fire hydrants must be pumped out after each time it is used. 
Notification shall be made to the Evendale Fire Department (in person) at the
end of each working day that a hydrant is used. Failure to do so will result in
the loss of any deposit and being subject to legal action.

1052.01  GENERAL.
   The design and construction of stormwater facilities in the Village of
Evendale is under the jurisdiction of the Mayor, Planning Commission, and
Village Engineer.  Specific design criteria shall be as required by the Rules
and Regulations of the Hamilton County Sanitary Engineering Department for
Storm Drainage unless specifically superseded herein.
(Ord. 19-86.  Passed 2-20-86)
1052.02  STORMWATER RETENTION/DETENTION.
   In order to minimize storm runoff damage to downstream properties and
overloading of existing drainage courses the following criteria shall be
followed on all developments of parcels one acre or larger in size.
   (a)   Maximum discharge levels.  All of the sections of this chapter are
hereby qualified to the extent that in no event shall the post development
storm discharge exceed the predevelopment 25-year storm frequency discharge
quantity at any point along the boundary of the development.
   (b)   Definition.
      (1)   "Retention."  Storage areas that maintain a planned permanent level
of water for a considerable length of time for aesthetic, agriculture,
consumptive, public safety, or other uses, released at a controlled rate.
      (2)   "Detention."  Storage of drainage for a short period of time then
released at a controlled rate.  The storage area may remain dry during non-
drainage periods.
   (c)   Criteria.
      (1)   Calculate existing site (predeveloped) runoff based on a 25-year
storm curve (in cfs.)
      (2)   Calculate proposed ultimate developed runoff based on a 50-year
storm curve (in cfs.)
      (3)   Provide a volume of on-site retention/detention of storm water
equal to (2)-(1) in cfs., calculated for a thirty (30) minute period.  The
method of retention/detention is subject to approval by the Village Engineer
and Planning Commission.
         Example:   V = (Q50-Q25) 30 min.
               (1800 seconds)
         Where      V = Required volume in cubic feet
               Q50 = Developed site runoff
               for a 50-year storm
               Q25 = Predeveloped site
               runoff for a 25-year storm
      (4)   Retention/Detention storage outlet pipe shall be designed based on
the runoff as calculated in subparagraph (c)(1) hereinabove.
      (5)   No on-site drainage shall outlet downstream of the main retention/
detention facility without providing supplemental retention/detention as per
the above criteria, or an equivalent reduction in the retention/detention
outlet.
(Ord. 19-86.  Passed 2-20-86; Ord. 36-86.  Passed 5- 15-86; Ord. 65-86.  Passed
8-21-86.)
1052.03  STORM SEWERS.
   All on-site storm sewers shall be designed on a ten-year storm curve with
the exception of the retention/detention outlet.
(Ord. 19-86.  Passed 2-20-86.)
1052.04  DRAINAGE CALCULATIONS.
   A professional engineer licensed to practice in Ohio shall submit detail
storm calculations and drainage maps of sufficient scale and contour interval
to verify the proposed hydraulic design.  A map indicating specific drainage
basins shall be submitted.
(Ord. 19-86.  Passed 2-20-86)
1052.05  SURFACE RUNOFF.
   Surface runoff quantity shall be determined by one of the following methods:
   (a)   One hundred acres or less - Rational Method (Q = CIA).
   (b)   More than 100 acres - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, Technical
Release No. 55, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service.
(Ord. 19-86.  Passed 2-20-86)
1052.06  INTENSITY OF PRECIPITATION.
   The "point" values of average precipitation intensity, ten inches per hour,
at Cincinnati is shown in the Appendix to this chapter, taken from page 35 of
U.S. Department of Commerce, Weather Bureau, Technical Paper No. 25, Rainfall
Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves.  For any given storm duration
(concentration time runoff), the curves show the average precipitation
intensity of storms of two, five, ten, 25, 50 and 100 year frequencies.  These
values may be used for drainage calculations using the "rational method" for
tributaries areas of 100 acres or less.
(Ord. 19-86.  Passed 2-20-86)
1052.07  INLET TIME.
   At the head of the system the inlet time may vary from five to 20 minutes
depending upon the size of the area and factors affecting rapid runoff.
(Ord. 19-86.  Passed 2-20-86)
1052.08  RUNOFF COEFFICIENT.
   Compute a weighted value of the drainage areas, using 0.9 for roof areas,
hard surface paved areas, sidewalks and macadam driveways, 0.30 for unpaved
unimproved areas, yards, and lawns.
(Ord. 19-86.  Passed 2-20-86; Ord. 65-86.  Passed 8- 21-86.)
1052.09  SIZE OF SEWER.
   The size of storm sewer shall be determined on the basis of the hydraulic
gradient to provide adequate capacity for the computed runoff, using n=0.015
for vitrified clay and concrete pipe, bituminous paved corrugated metal pipe
plain .024, paved invert .020, asphalt spun .013, and brick sewers, and n=0.013
for monolithic concrete sewers.  In no case shall the size be less than 12
inches in diameter.
1052.10  DEPTH.
   Minimum depth for storm sewers shall be planned to provide clearance for all
utilities and to permit inlet leads to be laid on not less than 1% slope.
(Ord. 19-86.  Passed 2-20-86.)

facilities in the same area of the rights-of-way so long as each such provider

agreements before collocating its facilities on facilities of others, including
the Village's facilities. A certificate of registration does not prevent a
provider from leasing space in or on the provider's system, so long as the
sharing of facilities does not cause a violation of law, including the

protect the public health, safety and welfare, to insure the structural
integrity of the rights-of-way, to protect the property and safety of other
users of the rights-of-way, and to minimize the disruption and inconvenience to
the traveling public.
(Ord. 01-63. Passed 8-2-01.)
1060.143  CONSTRUCTION PERMIT FEES.
   The Building Commissioner and Village Engineer shall, after providing notice
to and seeking input from all providers with systems in the right-of-way,
develop and maintain a schedule of permit fees in an amount sufficient to
recoup all reasonable costs that the Village incurs in permit issuance,
including permit costs and rights-of-way costs, as allowed by law. Such permit
fees shall be published in the Village's annual fee schedule as set by Village
ordinance. No construction permit shall be issued without payment of
construction permit fees except to the Village or County, which shall be
exempt. Construction permit fees that were paid for a permit that the Village
has revoked due to breach are not refundable.
(Ord. 01-63. Passed 8-2-01.)
1060.144  JOINT APPLICATIONS.

CONSTRUCTION, RELOCATION AND RESTORATION
1060.155  TECHNICAL INFORMATION REQUIRED.
   Prior to commencement of any initial construction of facilities in the
rights-of-way a construction permittee, upon the reasonable request of the
Village, shall provide technical information about the proposed route of
construction. The technical information required may consist of completion of
the following tasks:
   (a)   Secure all available "as-built" plans, plats, and other location data
indicating the existence and approximate location of all facilities along the
proposed construction route.
   (b)   Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
facilities along the proposed construction route, including, but not limited
to, manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts, and visible street cut
repairs.
   (c)   Determine and record the presence of and the approximate horizontal
and vertical location of all underground facilities the applicant or person on
whose behalf the permit was applied for owns or controls in the rights-of-way
along the proposed system route. Upon the reasonable request of the Village
Engineer, a permittee shall also record and identify the general location of
all other facilities in the rights-of-way along the proposed system route. For
the purposes of this section, general location shall mean the alignment of
other facilities in the rights-of-way, but shall not necessarily mean the depth
of other facilities in the rights-of-way.
   (d)   If a provider records the information requested above in an electronic
format, the provider shall provide the Village with an electronic copy of the
data obtained from completion of the tasks described in this section.
Incorporation of the data required herein by electronic means shall include
only data for new facilities that can be readily incorporated into the
Village's database.
   (e)   Where the proposed location of facilities and the location of existing
underground facilities appear to conflict with the plans as drafted,
construction permittee has the option of either utilizing non-destructive
digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the critical points identified
to determine as precisely as possible, the horizontal, vertical and spatial
position, composition, size and other specifications of the conflicting
underground facilities, or re-designing the construction plans to eliminate the
apparent conflict. A construction permittee shall not excavate more than a
three foot by three foot square hole in the rights-of-way to complete this
task.
   (f)   Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the tasks
described in this section, adjust the proposed system design to avoid the need
to relocate other underground facilities.
   (g)   All confidential/proprietary information submitted herein shall be so
labeled.
(Ord. 01-63. Passed 8-2-01.)
1060.156  QUALIFIED FIRM.
   All utility engineering studies conducted pursuant to Section
1060.155 through
1060.169 shall be performed by a firm specializing in utility engineering or
may be performed by the construction permittee if the construction permittee is
qualified to complete the project itself.
(Ord. 01-63. Passed 8-2-01.)
1060.157  COST OF STUDY.
   The construction permittee shall bear the cost of compliance with Sections
1060.155 through
1060.157 of this chapter.
(Ord. 01-63. Passed 8-2-01.)
1060.158  CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE.
   Unless otherwise provided for in this chapter, or unless the Building
Department waives any of the requirements of this section due to unique or
unusual circumstances, a construction permittee shall be required to: submit a
written construction schedule to the Village ten working days before commencing
any work in or about the rights-of-way and, shall further notify the Village
not less than two working days in advance of any excavation in the rights-of-
way. This section shall apply to all situations with the exception of
circumstances under Section
1060.193.
(Ord. 01-63. Passed 8-2-01.)
1060.159  LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   The placement of new facilities and replacement of old facilities,
either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with
applicable laws.
   (b)   The Village shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of
new or additional facilities within the rights-of-way if the right-of-way is
full. In making such decisions, the Village shall strive to the extent possible
to accommodate all existing and potential users of the rights-of-way, but shall
be guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety, and
welfare, the condition of the rights-of-way, the time of year, the protection
of existing facilities in the rights-of-way, future Village and County plans
for public improvements, development projects which have been determined to be
in the public interest, and the non-discriminatory and competitively neutral
treatment of providers.
   (c)   Upon the concurrence of the Village, or if it is determined by the
construction permittee and any appropriate local, state, or federal agency (or
other entity with jurisdictional authority) that any existing poles in the
rights-of-way are full, then those poles may be replaced with bigger and/or
taller poles in order to accommodate additional facilities or systems only
after the construction permittee has made reasonable attempts to reach an
acceptable solution without replacement with bigger and/or taller poles. This
subsection shall not apply to replacement of any existing pole(s) with
identically sized pole(s) which results from the destruction of or hazardous
condition of the existing pole(s) as long as no new facilities or additional
facilities are attached.
(Ord. 01-63. Passed 8-2-01.)
1060.160  LEAST DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY.
   All construction or maintenance of facilities shall be accomplished in the
manner resulting in the least amount of damage and disruption of the rights-of-
way. In addition, all cable, wire or fiber optic cable installed in the
subsurface rights-of-way under this chapter may be required to be installed in
conduit, and if so required, no cable, wire or fiber optic cable may be
installed under this chapter using "direct bury" techniques.

its facilities in the rights-of-way whenever the Village finds it necessary to
request such removal and relocation. In instances where the Village requests
removal and/or relocation, the Village shall waive all applicable construction
permit fees. Upon removal and/or relocation, the provider shall restore the
rights-of-way to a condition at least as good as its condition immediately
prior to said removal or relocation. If existing poles are required to be
removed and/or relocated, then the existing poles will be replaced with
reasonably obtainable poles of the same or similar size unless otherwise
permitted by the Village. The Village may request relocation and/or removal in
order to prevent unreasonable interference by the provider's facilities with:
      (1)   A public improvement undertaken or approved by the Village, City,
or County;
      (2)   When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the rights-of-way.
   (b)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider who has facilities in the
right-of-way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for the
purposes of the Village, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated
portion or excess portion in conformity with Ohio R.C. 723.04.01.
   (c)   If, in the reasonable judgment of the Village, a provider fails to
commence the removal process and/or relocation of its facilities as designated
by the Village, within thirty days after the Village's removal order is served
upon provider, or if a provider fails to substantially complete such removal,
including all associated repair of the rights-of-way of the Village, within
twelve months thereafter, then, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable
law, the village shall have the right to:
      (1)   Declare that all rights, title and interest to the facilities
belong to the Village with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited
to, the right to connect and use the facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title and interest in the facilities to another person for operation;
      (2)   Authorize removal of the facilities installed by the provider in,
on, over or under the rights-of-way of the Village at provider's cost and
expense, by another person, however the Village shall have no liability for any
damage caused by such action and the provider shall be liable to the Village
for all reasonable costs incurred by the Village in such action; and
      (3)   To the extent consistent with applicable law, any portion of the
provider's facilities in, on, over or under the rights-of-way of the Village
designated by the Village for removal and not timely removed by the provider
shall belong to and become the property of the Village without payment to the
provider, and the provider shall execute and deliver such documents, as the
Village shall request, in form and substance acceptable to the Village, to
evidence such ownership by the Village.
(Ord. 01-63. Passed 8-2-01.)
1060.162  PRE-EXCAVATION FACILITIES LOCATION.
   Before the start date of any rights-of-way excavation, each provider who has
facilities located in the area to be excavated shall be responsible to mark the
horizontal and make every reasonable attempt using best efforts, to mark the
approximate vertical placement of all its facilities. All providers shall
notify and work closely with the excavation contractor in an effort to
establish the exact location of its facilities and the best procedure for
excavation.
(Ord. 01-63. Passed 8-2-01.)
1060.163  RIGHTS-OF-WAY RESTORATION.
   (a)   The work to be done under the permit, and the restoration of the
rights-of-way as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified
in the permit. In addition to its own work, the permittee must restore the
general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including trench backfill,
paving and its foundations in accordance with the standards established by the
Village Engineer, subject to any applicable laws. The permittee must also
inspect the area of the work and use reasonable care to maintain the same
condition for twelve months thereafter.
   (b)   In approving an application for a permit, the Village may choose
either to have the permittee restore the rights-of-way or the Village may
restore the rights-of-way itself at the expense of the permittee.
   (c)   If the Village chooses to allow permittee to restore the rights-of-
way, construction permittee shall at the time of application of a construction
permit post a construction bond in an amount determined by the Village to be
sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the rights-of-way to a condition at
least as good as its condition immediately prior to construction. If, twelve
months after completion of the restoration of the rights-of-way, the Village
determines that the rights-of-way have been properly restored, the surety on
the construction bond shall be released.
   (d)   The permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and
with the materials specified and approved by the Village.
   (e)   By restoring the rights-of-way itself, the permittee guarantees its
work and shall maintain it for twelve months following its completion. During
this twelve month period, it shall, upon notification from the Building
Department, correct all restoration work to the extent necessary using the
method required by the Village Engineer. Weather permitting, said work shall be
completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the
Building Department.
   (f)   If the permittee fails to restore the rights-of-way in the manner and
to the condition required by the Village, or fails to satisfactorily and timely
complete all repairs required by the Village, the Village, at its option, with
notice to provider and a reasonable time to cure, may do such work. In that
event, the permittee shall pay to the Village, within thirty days of billing,
the cost of restoring the rights-of-way and any other costs incurred by the
Village. Upon failure to pay, the Village may call upon any bond or letter of
credit posted by permittee and/or pursue any and all legal and equitable
remedies.
(Ord. 01-63. Passed 8-2-01.)
1060.164  DAMAGE TO PROVIDER'S FACILITIES AND TO OTHER FACILITIES.
   (a)   In the case of an emergency, and if possible after reasonable efforts
to contact the provider seeking a timely response, when the Village performs
work in the rights-of-way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move
a provider's facilities to protect those facilities, the costs associated
therewith will be billed to that provider and shall be paid within thirty days
from the date of billing. Upon failure to pay, the Village may pursue all legal
and equitable remedies in the event a provider does not pay or the Village may
call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by permittee and pursue any and
all legal or equitable remedies.
   (b)   Each provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
facilities in the rights-of-way which it or its facilities damage. Each
provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the
facilities of another provider caused during the Village's response to an
emergency caused by such provider's facilities.
(Ord. 01-63. Passed 8-2-01.)
1060.165  RIGHTS-OF-WAY VACATION.

the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the health,
safety, or welfare of the public, violates any law, or which violates the terms
and conditions of the permit and/or this chapter.
   (d)   The inspector may issue an order to correct work which does not
conform to the permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or codes. The
order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for
revocation of the permit. The order may be served on the permittee as provided
in Section
1060.233. An order may be appealed to the Village Engineer. The decision of the
Director of Public Service may be appealed to the BZA whose decision shall be
final. If not appealed, within ten days after issuance of the order, the
provider shall present proof to the Village Engineer that the violation has
been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the required time,
the Village Engineer may revoke the permit pursuant to Section
1060.194.
(Ord. 01-63. Passed 8-2-01.)
1060.168  OTHER OBLIGATIONS.
   Obtaining a construction permit does not relieve permittee of its duty to
obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay all
fees, including on-site inspection fees, required by the Village, or any other

considerations relating to the public health, safety, and welfare.
(Ord. 01-63. Passed 8-2-01.)
1060.191  PERMISSIVE DENIAL.
   The Village Engineer may deny a permit in order to protect the public
health, safety, and welfare, to prevent interference with the safety and
convenience of ordinary travel over the rights-of-way, or when necessary to
protect the rights-of-way and its users. The Village Engineer, in his or her
discretion, may consider one or more of the following factors: the extent to
which rights-of-way space where the permit is sought is available; the
competing demands for the particular space in the rights-of-way; the
availability of other locations in the rights-of-way or in other rights-of-way
for the proposed facilities; the applicability of this chapter or other
regulations of the rights-of-way that affect location of facilities in the
rights-of-way; the degree of compliance of the provider with the terms and
conditions of this chapter and its requirements, and other applicable

1060.190(a) and (b), the Director of Public Service may issue a permit in any
case where the permit is necessary:
   (a)   To prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the permit
applicant if established by credible evidence satisfactory to the Village;
   (b)   To allow such customer to materially improve its service; or
   (c)   To allow a new economic development project. To be granted a permit
under this section, the permit applicant must not have had knowledge of the
hardship, the plans for improvement of service, or the development project at
the time it was required to submit its list of next year projects.
(Ord. 01-63. Passed 8-2-01.)
1060.193  WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT.
   (a)   Emergency situations. Each provider shall, as soon as reasonably
practicable, notify the Building Department of any event regarding its
facilities which it considers to be an emergency. The provider may proceed to
take whatever actions are necessary in order to respond to the emergency.
Within two business days, unless otherwise extended by the Village Engineer,
after the occurrence or discovery of the emergency (whichever is later), the
provider shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated
therewith and fulfill all the requirements necessary to bring itself into
compliance with this chapter for any and all actions taken in response to the
emergency. In the event that the Village becomes aware of an emergency
regarding a provider 's facilities, the Village may attempt to contact the
provider or system representative of each provider affected, or potentially
affected, by the emergency. In any event, the Village may take whatever action
it deems necessary in order to respond to the emergency, the cost of which
shall be borne by the provider whose facilities caused the emergency.

provider who constructs in, on, above, within, over, below or through a right-
of-way without a valid permit shall subsequently obtain a permit, pay double
the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by the
Codified Ordinances, deposit with the Village the fees necessary to correct any
damage to the rights-of-way and comply with all of the requirements of this

a privilege and not as a right. The Village reserves the right, as provided
herein, to revoke any permit, without refunding any fees, in the event of a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any law or any provision or
condition of the permit. A substantial breach by permittee shall include, but
shall not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   The violation of any provision or condition of the permit;
      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or condition of the
permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon
the Village or its citizens;
      (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
permit;
      (4)   The failure to obtain and/or maintain required construction or
removal bonds and/or insurance;
      (5)   The failure to obtain and/or maintain, when required, a certificate
of registration;
      (6)   The failure to complete construction in a timely manner; or
      (7)   The failure to correct any nonconformity as ordered pursuant to
Section
1060.157(d).
   (b)   If the Village Engineer determines that the permittee has committed a
substantial breach of a term or condition of any law or any provision or
condition of the permit, the Village Engineer shall serve a written demand upon
the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued
violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. Upon, a substantial
breach, as stated above, the Village Engineer, may place additional or revised
conditions on the permit.
   (c)   By the close of the next business day following receipt of
notification of the breach, permittee shall contact the Village Engineer with a
plan, acceptable to the Village Engineer, for its correction. Permittee's
failure to so contact the Village Engineer, or the permittee's failure to
submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the
approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit.
   (d)   From time to time, the Village Engineer may establish a list of
standard conditions for the permit. A substantial breach of any condition shall
also constitute an unauthorized use of the public rights-of-way as defined in
Section
1060.110.
   (e)   If a permittee commits a second substantial breach as outlined above,
permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and not be allowed further
permits for one full year, except for emergency repairs.
   (f)   If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the Village
for the Village's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs
of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such
revocation.

excluding the County or Village shall deposit with the Building Department, in
a form acceptable to the Village Solicitor, an irrevocable, unconditional
letter of credit and/or surety bond in an amount determined by the Village
Engineer to be appropriate, based upon fair and reasonable criteria. Unless a
Construction default, problem, or deficiency involves an Emergency or endangers
the safety of the general public, the Village Engineer shall serve the
construction permittee with notice detailing any Construction default, problem,
or deficiency. If the Village Engineer determines that correction or repair of

officials, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors from all costs,
liabilities, claims, and suits for damages of any kind arising out of the
construction, presence, installation, maintenance, repair, replacement,
restoration, or operation of its facilities, or out of any activity undertaken
in or near a rights-of-way, whether any act or omission complained of is
authorized, allowed, or prohibited by a permit. A provider or permittee further
agrees that it will not bring, nor cause to be brought, any action, suit or
other proceeding claiming damages, or seeking any other relief against the
Village's agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers and
subcontractors for any claim nor for any award arising out of the presence,
installation, maintenance or operation of its facilities, or any activity
undertaken in or near a rights-of-way, whether the act or omission complained
of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by a permit. This section is not, as to
third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the
provider, permittee, or to the Village; and the provider or permittee, in
defending any action on behalf of the Village, if allowable by law, shall be
entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that the Village
could assert in its own behalf. Any and all exercise of the above shall be
consistent with, but not limited to, the following:
   (a)   To the fullest extent permitted by law, all providers and permittees
shall, at their sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Village, its agents, elected officials, officers, employees,
volunteers and subcontractors, from and against any and all lawsuits, claims

or others), causes of actions, actions, liability, and judgments for injury or
damages including but not limited to expenses for reasonable legal fees and
disbursements assumed by the Village in connection therewith:
      (1)   To persons or property, to the extent arising out of or through the
acts or omissions of provider, its subcontractors, agents or employees
attributable to the occupation by the provider or permittee of the rights-of-
way, to which permittee's or provider's negligence shall in any way contribute.
      (2)   Arising out of any claim for invasion of the right of privacy, for
defamation of person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement of
any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent or any other right
of any person, firm and corporation by the provider or permittee, but excluding
claims arising out of or related to Village programming.
      (3)   Arising out of provider's or permittee's failure to comply with the
provisions of any law applicable to provider or permittee in its business
hereunder.
   (b)   The foregoing indemnification is conditioned upon the Village:
      (1)   Giving provider or permittee reasonable notice of any claim or the
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is
sought;
      (2)   Affording the provider or permittee the opportunity to participate
in any compromise, settlement, or other resolution or disposition of any claim
or proceeding subject to indemnification; and
      (3)   Cooperating in the defense of such claim and making available to
the provider or permittee all pertinent information under the Village's
control.
   (c)   The Village shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any
such action or proceeding and to participate in the investigation and defense
thereof, and the provider or permittee shall pay all reasonable fees and
expense of such separate counsel if employed.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
1060.230  NON-EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.
   The remedies provided in this chapter are not exclusive or in lieu of other
rights and remedies that the Village may have at law or in equity. The Village

or threatened injury to the rights-of-way, including damages to the rights-of-
way, whether caused by a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or
other provisions of applicable law.
(Ord. 01-63. Passed 8-2-01.)
1060.231  SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this
chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or
administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a
separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect
the validity of the remaining portions thereof. If a regulatory body or a court
of competent jurisdiction should determine by a final, non-appealable order
that any permit, right or any portions of this chapter are illegal or
unenforceable, then any such permit or right granted or deemed to exist
hereunder shall be considered as a revocable permit with a mutual right in
either party to terminate without cause upon giving sixty days written notice
to the other. The requirements and conditions of such a revocable permit shall
be the same requirements and conditions as set forth in the permit, right or
registration, respectively, except for conditions relating to the term of the
permit and the right of termination. If a permit or right shall be considered a
revocable permit as provided herein, the permittee must acknowledge the
authority of the Village to issue such revocable permit and the power to revoke
it.

permit, or provider by applying for and being issued a certificate of
registration, agrees that all lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or
police power, or otherwise as are or the same may be from time to time vested
in or reserved to the Village, shall be in full force and effect and subject to
the exercise thereof by the Village at any time. A permittee or provider is

safety and welfare of the public and is deemed to agree to comply with all
applicable general laws enacted by the Village pursuant to such powers.

1222.01  DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   For the purposes of this chapter a subdivision of land is:
      (1)   The division of land into two or more tracts, sites or parcels of
one acre or less in area:
      (2)   The dedication of a road, highway or street through a tract of land
regardless of area; and
      (3)   Resubdivisions of land heretofore divided or platted into lots,
sites or parcels, containing two acres or more or a total area of two acres or
more.
   Any sale or contract of sale or agreement to purchase any lot or division of
land, either by lot description or by metes and bounds as defined in the
preceding portion of this section, shall constitute a subdivision of land and
require, prior to any sale or contract of sale or agreement to purchase and
before the delivery of a deed, the approval and recording of a plat as herein
required.
   (b)   Whenever the word "Commission" is used in this chapter, it shall be
deemed to refer to the Village Planning Commission.
(Ord. 28-53. Passed 10-6-53; Ord. 35-73. Passed 9-5-73.)
1222.02  APPROVAL OF SUBDIVISION PLATS.
   Every subdivision of land within the Village shall be shown upon a plat and
submitted to the Planning Commission for approval or disapproval. Any plat
which has been approved by the Commission, with the approval endorsed thereon
in writing, shall be submitted to Council for its consideration, approval or
disapproval. If the Commission does not approve the plat, it may then be
approved by Council only after a three-fourths vote of all members elected
thereto. No plat shall be recorded in the office of the Recorder of Deeds and
no lot shall be sold from such plat unless and until approved as hereinabove
provided.
(Ord. 28-53. Passed 10-6-53.)
1222.03  PRELIMINARY PLAN.
   (a)   In seeking to subdivide land into building lots, or to dedicate
streets, alleys or land for public use, or to subdivide land into building
lots, together with the dedication or reservation of public or private streets
respectively, the owner shall submit five black and white copies of a
preliminary sketch plan to the Planning Commission before submission of the
final plan.
   Plats containing three lots or less may be exempted from the provisions of
this section. The preliminary plan shall show:
      (1)   The location of present property lines, streets, buildings,
watercourses, tree masses and other existing features within the area to be
subdivided and similar facts regarding existing conditions on land immediately
adjacent thereto;
      (2)   The proposed location and width of streets, alleys, lots, building
lines and easements;
      (3)   Existing sewers, water mains, culverts and other underground
structures within the tract or immediately adjacent thereto. The location and
size of the nearest water main and sewer or outlet are to be indicated in a
general way upon the plat.
      (4)   The title under which the proposed subdivision is to be recorded
and the name of the subdivider;
      (5)   The names and adjoining boundaries of all adjoining subdivisions
and the names of record owners of adjoining parcels of unsubdivided land;
      (6)   Contours with intervals of five feet or less;
      (7)   The northpoint, scale and date;
      (8)   The zoning district or districts that affect the property to be
subdivided; and
      (9)   Grades and profiles of streets and plans or written and signed
statements regarding the grades of proposed streets; the width and type of
pavement; the location, size and type of sanitary sewers, or other sewage
disposal facilities, water mains and hydrants and other utilities; storm water
drainage facilities and other proposed improvements, such as sidewalks,
planting and parks.
   Preliminary plans not containing all of the above data will not be approved.
Preliminary plans must be approved by the Commission and by Council in
accordance with Section
1222.02.
   Approval of the preliminary plan does not constitute an acceptance of the
subdivision by the Village. One copy of the approved preliminary plan, signed
by the Chairman of the Commission and the Mayor, shall be retained in the
office of the Village Clerk. One signed copy shall be given to the subdivider.
   Receipt of this signed copy is authorization for the subdivider to proceed
with the preparation of plans and specifications for the minimum improvements
required in Section
1222.12, and with the preparation of the final plat. Prior to the construction
of any improvements required in Section
1222.12, or to the submission of any bond, the subdivider shall furnish Council
all plans, information and data necessary for such improvements. These plans
shall be examined by Council and will be approved if in accordance with the
requirements of Section
1222.12.  Following this approval, construction can be started or the amount of
a bond determined.
   If the final plat conforms to the approved preliminary plat and if the
necessary improvements are constructed in accordance with the approved plans
therefor or a satisfactory bond submitted assuring their construction in
accordance with the approved plans, the final plat will be approved by the
Commission and by Council.
(Ord. 28-53. Passed 10-6-53.)
   (b)   Anything contained in this section to the contrary notwithstanding, no
final plat shall be approved by the Commission and Council unless and until a
satisfactory bond has been submitted assuring satisfactory maintenance of the
improvements shown thereon for a period of two years.
(Ord. 37-70. Passed 5-21-70.)
1222.04  FINAL PLAT.
   The final plat on tracing cloth and five black and white prints thereof,
together with copies of any deed restrictions where such are too lengthy to be
shown on the plat, and three prints of certified plans showing the improvements
that have been constructed within the subdivision (or a bond assuring
construction of such improvements in accordance with plans previously approved)
shall be submitted to the Planning Commission. Before approving the plat of all
or part of a proposed subdivision, Council shall require proof that the
improvements and revisions thereof required in Section
1222.12 have been satisfactorily completed. The Commission and Council shall
act upon the final plat within thirty days after it has been submitted unless
the subdivider agrees to an extension of this period. The approval of the
Commission shall be shown on the plat, with the date of such approval, over the
signature of the Chairman of the Commission. The approval of Council shall be
shown on the plat, with the date of such approval, over the signature of the
Mayor.
   The final plat is to be drawn at a scale of 100 feet or less to the inth
from an accurate survey and on one or more sheets whose maximum dimensions are
twenty-nine inches by thirty inches.
   The final plat shall show:
   (a)   The boundary lines of the area being subdivided with accurate
distances and bearings;
   (b)   The lines of all proposed streets and alleys with their width and
names;
   (c)   The accurate outline of any property which is offered for dedication
for public use;
   (d)   The line of departure of one street from another;
   (e)   The lines of all adjoining lands and the lines of adjacent streets and
alleys with their widths and names;
   (f)   All lot lines and an identification system for all lots and blocks;
   (g)   Building lines and easements for rights of way provided for public
use, services or utilities with figures showing their dimensions;
   (h)   All dimensions, both linear and angular, necessary for locating
boundaries of subdivisions, lots, streets, alleys, easements for building lines
and of any other area for public or private use, the linear dimensions to be
expressed in feet and decimals of a foot;
   (i)   Radii, arcs and chords, points of tangency, central angles for all
curvilinear streets and radii for all rounded corners;
   (j)   All survey monuments and bench marks, together with their
descriptions;
   (k)   The name of the subdivision and a description of the property
subdivided, showing its location and extent, points of compass, scale of plan,
and name of owner or owners or the subdivider;
   (l)   Certification by a civil engineer or surveyor to the effect that the
plan represents a survey made by him and that all the necessary survey
monuments are correctly shown thereon;
   (m)   Private restrictions and trusteeships and their periods of existence.
Should such restrictions and trusteeships be of such length as to make the
lettering of same on the plat impractical, and thus necessitate the preparation
of a separate instrument, reference to such instrument shall be made on the
plat. Plats shall contain proper acknowledgments of owners and the consent by
the mortgagee to such plat and restrictions.
   (n)   Before it is recorded, a certificate shall accompany the final plat,
showing that all taxes payable have been previously paid in full.
(Ord. 28-53. Passed 10-6-53.)
1222.05  STREETS, ALLEYS AND EASEMENTS.
   The widths and arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall conform with
the street arrangement shown on the Official Street, School and Park Plan
adopted by the Planning Commission on August 3, 1953, including any amendment
thereof.
   The minimum width for minor streets shall be fifty feet. When streets adjoin
unsubdivided property, a half-street, not less, however, than thirty feet in
width, may be dedicated, and whenever the subdivided property adjoins a half-
street the remainder of the street shall be dedicated.
   Streets that are obviously in alignment with others already existing and
named shall bear the names of the existing streets.
   Alleys are not permitted in residential areas. Alleys may be provided in the
rear of business lots and, if provided, shall be at least twenty feet wide. A
five-foot cut-off shall be made at all acute angle alley intersections.
Adequate provision for off-street parking is to be made in accordance with the
provisions of the Zoning Code for all platted business lots. Where alleys are
not provided, easements of not less than seven and one-half feet in width shall
be provided on each side of all rear lot lines, and along side lot lines, where
necessary, for poles, wires, conduits, storm and sanitary sewers and gas, water
and heat mains. Easements of greater width may be required along or across lots
where necessary for the extension of main storm and sanitary sewers and other
utilities, and where both water and sewer lines are located in the same
easement.
   Intersections, streets and property access shall conform to O.K.I.
(Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana) Access Manual.
(Ord. 28-53. Passed 10-6-53; Ord. 36-84. Passed 8-16-84.)
1222.06  BLOCKS.
   (a)   Blocks over 750 feet in length shall have a crosswalk near the center
of the block. The right of way for such walks shall not be less than ten feet
in width.
   (b)   Where it is desirable to subdivide a tract of land, which, because of
its size or location, does not permit an allotment directly related to a normal
street arrangement, there may be established one or more "places." Such a place
may be in the form of a court, a dead-end street or other arrangement,
provided, however, that proper access shall be given to all lots from a
dedicated place (street or court). Such a place shall terminate in an open
space (preferably circular) having a minimum radius of fifty feet. Except in
unusual instances and when shown on the Official Street, School and Park Plan,
no dead-end street or place shall exceed 1,000 feet in length.
(Ord. 28-53. Passed 10-6-53.)
1222.07  LOTS.
   (a)   All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to straight street
lines, or radial to curved street lines, unless a variation to this rule will
give a better street and lot plan. Lots with double frontage should be avoided.
   (b)   No lot that is to be used for residential purposes shall contain an
area less than required by the Zoning Code.
   (c)   Corner lots shall have extra width sufficient to permit the
establishment of front building lines on both the front and the side of the
lots adjoining the streets.
   (d)   Lots on all street intersections shall have a minimum radius of twenty
feet at the street corner.
   (e)   All proposed lots in the subdivision of a previously plotted lot or
lots shall have a minimum frontage where the lot adjoins a public right-of-way
of the greater of the minimum lot width as provided in the Zoning Code; or, the
minimum frontage of lots adjoining public rights-of-way in the subdivision in
which the original lots to be subdivided, were subdivided.
(Ord. 28-53. Passed 10-6-53; Ord. 54-86. Passed 7-17-86.)
1222.08  BUILDING LINES.
   Building lines shall be shown on all lots. Such building lines shall not be
less than required by the Zoning Code. Restrictions requiring buildings to be
set back to such building lines shall either be shown on the plat or shall be
contained in a separately recorded instrument and referred to on the plat.
(Ord. 28-53. Passed 10-6-53.)
1222.09  CHARACTER OF DEVELOPMENT.
   The Planning Commission shall confer with the subdivider regarding the type
and character of development that will be permitted in the subdivision, and may
agree with the subdivider as to certain minimum restrictions to be placed upon
the property to prevent the construction of substandard buildings, and control
the type of structures, or the use of the lots which, unless so controlled,
would clearly depreciate the character and value of the proposed subdivision
and of adjoining property.
(Ord. 28-53. Passed 10-6-53.)
1222.10  PARKS, SCHOOL SITES, ETC.
   In subdividing property, consideration shall be given to suitable sites for
schools, parks, playgrounds and other common areas for public use so as to
conform to the recommendations of the Planning Commission in its adopted Plan
of the Village. Any provision for schools, parks and playgrounds should be
indicated on the preliminary plan in order that it may be determined when and
in what manner such areas will be dedicated or acquired.
(Ord. 28-53. Passed 10-6-53.)
1222.11  EASEMENTS ALONG STREAMS.
   Whenever any stream or important surface drainage course is located in an
area that is being subdivided, the subdivider shall dedicate an adequate
easement along each side of the stream for the purpose of widening, deepening,
sloping, improving or protecting the stream or for drainage, parkway or
recreational use.
(Ord. 28-53. Passed 10-6-53.)
1222.12  IMPROVEMENTS.
   Plans for improvements required in this section shall be prepared by a
registered engineer. The improvements listed below in subsections (a) through
(e) hereof, shall be installed prior to the approval of the final plat, which
Is prepared for recording purposes. In lieu of actual completion of such
improvements, the subdivider may file with Council a surety bond to secure to
Council the actual construction of such improvements in a manner satisfactory
to Council and within a period not to exceed two years. Such bond shall be in
an amount and with surety and conditions satisfactory to Council and shall be
adequate to cover the cost of the improvements.
   The owner of the tract may prepare and secure tentative approval of a final
subdivision plat of the entire area and may install the above improvements only
in a portion of such area, but the improvements must be installed in any
portion of the area for which a final plan is approved for recording, and the
owner may sell or lease lots, or offer lots for sale or lease, only in the
improved portion of property.
   (a)   Permanent Markers. All subdivision boundary corners and the four
corners of all street intersections shall be definitely marked with permanent
monuments. A permanent marker shall be deemed to be concrete with a minimum
dimension of four inches extending below the frost line or steel pipe firmly
embedded in concrete which extends below the frost line.  Should conditions
prohibit the placing of monuments on line, off-set marking will be permitted,
provided, however, that exact off-set courses and distances are shown on the
subdivision plat.  A permanent bench mark shall be accessibly placed and
accurately noted on the subdivision plat.
   (b)   Street Improvements. All streets shall be graded and the roadway
improved by surfacing. All grading and surfacing shall be done under the
supervision of the Village Engineer and shall be subject to his approval.
Roadway surfacing shall be of 3,000 pound concrete six inches thick with an
integral curb, or six inches of a water-bound macadam base plus a one and one-
half inch plant-mix asphaltic concrete wearing surface. Roadway surfacing shall
be at least twenty-six feet wide, including the curb, provided, however, that
pavement of cul-de-sac streets not over 400 feet in length need not be wider
than twenty feet, including the curb, and provided, further, that cul-de-sac
streets shall terminate in a paved turn-around with a minimum radius of twenty
feet, and provided, further, that in subdivisions where the average area of
lots exceeds one acre and the minimum width of any lot is 150 feet, the width
of the roadway surfacing may be reduced to twenty feet.
   (c)   Water Lines. The subdivider shall connect with the City of Cincinnati
water supply and make it available for each lot within the subdivided area.
Fire hydrants shall also be installed by the subdivider in accordance with the
requirements of the Village Engineer.
   (d)   Sewers. The subdivider shall connect with the sanitary sewerage system
of the Village and provide adequate sewer lines, accessible to each lot, or the
plat shall contain restrictions requiring each house to provide individual
sewage disposal facilities meeting the standards of, and receiving the approval
of, the Hamilton County Board of Health.  Adequate provision shall be made for
the disposal of storm water subject to the approval of Council.
(Ord. 28-53. Passed 10-6-53.)
   (e)   Utilities. The subdivider shall provide:
      (1)   Electric distribution facilities;
      (2)   Facilities for street lighting; and
      (3)   Telephone facilities to be installed by the appropriate utility
company to serve the subdivision underground within or along the right of way
of existing or proposed public streets, and all easements necessary for the
location, relocation and extension of such facilities shall be provided by the
subdivider.
   All service lines connecting the ultimate customer's service entrance
equipment to the utility company's main line facilities shall be installed by
the subdivider, at the subdivider's cost, at a point to be determined by the
utility company, the actual connection at the utility company's main line to be
made by the company.
   Installation of pad-mounted transformers are permitted, and nothing in this
chapter shall be construed as requiring the installation of underground
transformers, except on payment of an additional charge therefor in accordance
with requirements of the appropriate utility company.
   Prior to the paving of any street, the subdivider, at his or its cost, shall
install conduit crossovers for electric facilities as specified by the utility
company. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the
installation or maintenance of street lighting poles or standards or to require
the wider grounding of existing overhead or other electric facilities.
   The following definitions shall govern this subsection:
"Facilities" means wires, cables, transformers and appurtenances; "subdivider"
includes any owner, builder or developer; "electric distribution facilities"
and "telephone facilities" include only those facilities serving homes in
subdivisions of the kind described herein, and do not include facilities which
deliver power or telephone service through such subdivisions, or transmission
facilities which terminate in such subdivisions.
(Ord. 43-70. Passed 7-2-70.)
1222.13  VARIATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.
   Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape or is
surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict
application of the requirements contained in this chapter would result in real
difficulties and substantial hardships or injustices, Council, after a public
hearing, may vary or modify such requirements so that the subdivider is allowed
to develop his property in a reasonable manner, but so that at the same time,
the public welfare and interests of the Village are protected and the general
intent and spirit of this chapter are preserved.

1224.01  ORGANIZATION AND PREPARATION OF PLAN; FINDINGS.
   The development plan for the Village of Evendale is a guide to the future
land use and street layout of the Village of Evendale.  In future years,
specific plans may be adopted to supplement this development plan. This
development plan is designed to be flexible to permit changes and redevelopment
of certain areas of the Village as the need arises.
   (a)   Components of this development plan.  There are three components of
this development plan.  The first component is the zoning map and planning code
setting forth the specific uses for which each parcel of land in the village
may be used. The next component is the plan showing proposed street locations,
proposed green belt areas, and locations where streets must connect to one
another.  The final component of the development plan is the text.
   (b)   Background to creation of this development plan.  This development
plan has been developed through an analysis of the Proposed Development Plan of
1975 by Dalton, Dalton, and Little; a study of existing maps showing the street
layouts as of 1990; a 1990 study of unused vacant, or remaining agricultural
land; consideration of the Norris and Foote Reading Road Corridor Study of
1984; and an analysis of the effects of the Zoning Code of the Village of
Evendale adopted in 1953 and subsequent revisions.
   (c)   Conclusions drawn from material considered in developing this
development plan.
      (1)   The Village of Evendale is a municipality of 5.5 sq. mi. within the
Greater Cincinnati Metropolitan Area. Based on its geographical location, the
Village need not offer all type's of services, dwelling arrangements, and
employment which are available in the Greater Cincinnati Metropolitan Area as a
whole. Existing development has created four basic land uses within the
Village.  Major areas include:  (1) a large industrial area in the Mill Creek
Valley between Interstate 75 and the easternmost railroad tracks in the
Village; (2) a large residential area with churches, schools, and a cemetery
east of Reading Road; (3) a major commercial area centered along Reading Road;
and (4) a public facilities area located on the northeast corner of Glendale-
Milford Road and Reading Road.  In addition, west of Interstate 75 a mix of a
few single-family dwellings, large church-school areas, and a commercial/
industrial area exists.
      (2)   The major traffic arteries within the Village consist of an
Interstate Highway (I-75) running north and south completely through the
Village, two major east-west streets (Cooper and Glendale-Milford Roads) taking
a somewhat parallel course about a mile apart, and U.S. Route 42 (Reading Road)
running parallel to I-75 dividing the eastern residential area from the
commercial/industrial valley area.
      (3)   Externally, a circle freeway (I-275) runs east-west about three
miles north of the Village, an Interstate Highway (I-71) lies about three miles
to the east of the Village, and the uncompleted Cross County Highway parallels
I-275 three miles to the south.  It is anticipated that upon completion of the
Cross County Highway, Glendale-Milford will no longer be designated as a state
route.
      (4)   The topography of the Village is such that the commercial/
industrial areas are in the Mill Creek Valley and the residential areas arc
located in the highlands in the eastern and western areas of the Village.
      (5)   The economy of the Village is such that there are approximately ten
times the number of people working in the Village as living in it.  The tax
base of the Village is dominated by one of the largest employers in the Greater
Cincinnati Metropolitan Area with a number of small businesses providing
support to this employer.  In addition, there is a concentration of truck-
oriented businesses along Evendale Drive which runs parallel to I-75 north of
Glendale-Milford Road.
   (d)   Specific deficiencies in the land use of the Village.
      (1)   A number of parcels of industrial, commercial, office/research,
industrial truck and planned business development areas are undeveloped or
underdeveloped.
      (2)   Channelization of the Millcreek is incomplete.
   (e)   Specific successes of the land use of the Village.
      (1)   The greatest success in the development of the Village of Evendale
has been in its residential areas.  Aerial photographs demonstrate that the
development has preserved large green areas within the residential areas. 
Areas which in 1975 wore undeveloped have been fully developed as upscale
single-family detached housing areas.  Additional regulations have been
established to protect these areas from encroachment by commercial
establishments, the annoyance of through traffic, deterioration caused by
developments in neighboring communities, and to make all areas accessible to
the safety service of the Village.
      (2)   Other successes in Village planning which should not be overlooked
are the development of excellent public recreational facilities, the
development of a street system which moves large volumes of traffic in and out
of one of the largest employers in the metropolitan area efficiently without
long delays and traffic jams, and the addition of commercial and office
buildings on Reading Road.
(Ord. 91-93. Passed 4-2-92)
1224.02  GOALS The following goals are general statements of what is desired in
future land use patterns:
   (a)   Maintain to the fullest extent possible the natural topography and
landscape of the Village;
   (b)   Encourage controlled growth of the residential, commercial, and
industrial areas of the Village so that they can exist harmoniously within the
Village;
   (c)   Preserve the existing residential development pattern;
   (d)   Preserve local commercial areas to serve the residents of the Village
as well as industrial employees who enter and leave the Village each day.
(Ord. 91-93. Passed 4-2-92)
1224.03  OBJECTIVES FOR RESIDENTIAL AREAS.
   The objectives of the Zoning Map, the Zoning and Planning Code of 1986, with
subsequent revisions and the Development Plan of 1991 are to meet the goals and
needs of the Village of Evendale as outlined above.  Some specific objectives
are set out in this section and sections
1224.04 through
1224.07.
   (a)   The total population should not exceed 5000 persons, which enables
Evendale to maintain its status as a Village.
   (b)   The single-family residential areas begun in 1953 should be preserved
intact.
   The density of population in single-family residential areas should not
exceed two families per acre.
   (c)   The integration of churches and schools with the residential areas
should be continued.
   (d)   Regulations controlling recreational facilities within residential
areas should be continued.
   (e)   The residential areas east of Reading Road should be protected from
the industrial areas by the commercial strip along Reading Road.  They in turn
should be protected from the commercial strip by at least one of the following:
      (1)   A green belt owned by the Village of Evendale;
      (2)   The natural terrain whereby the residences are elevated above the
commercial areas;
      (3)   The Public Facilities Use Districts.
   (f)   Churches and schools should be required to have direct access onto
main roads.
   (g)   The location of required connections between existing undeveloped
tracts of land and existing streets is intended to assure that all residential
areas developed in the future are accessible.
(Ord. 91-93. Passed 4-2-92)
1224.04  OBJECTIVES FOR PUBLIC FACILITIES AREAS
   The Public Facilities Use District includes the Village grounds and the
areas occupied by Landmark Baptist Church and St. Rita's School for the Deaf. 
Specific objectives for the Public Facilities Use District are as follows:
   (a)   Population density should not exceed two families or six persons per
acre;
   (b)   Controlled development of each public facility is encouraged within
the scope of this plan.
(Ord. 91-93. Passed 4-2-92)
1224.05  OBJECTIVES FOR COMMERCIAL AREAS.
   Specific objectives for the Commercial Areas are as follows:
   (a)   Maintain the general commercial development on the East side of
Reading Road.
   (b)   Encourage development of the heavy commercial area on West side of
Reading Road, and along Glendale-Milford Road West of 1-75.
   (c)   Persons should not be permitted to reside in the Commercial District.
(Ord. 91-93. Passed 4-2-92)
1224.06  OBJECTIVES FOR INDUSTRIAL USE AREAS.
   Specific objectives for the Industrial Use Districts are as follows:
   (a)   The objective of the Industrial Truck Center District is to
concentrate truck traffic near I- 75 where it will not interfere with other
industrial users and will concentrate road damage in one area.
   (b)   The objective of the General Industrial Area is to provide areas for
large and small industries to operate.  The types of industries which are
allowed are those which create low off-site air, water, and noise pollution.
   (c)   Persons should not be permitted to reside in the Industrial Use
District.
(Ord. 91-93. Passed 4-2-92)
1224.07  OBJECTIVES FOR OFFICE/RESEARCH AREA.
   The Office/Research District is intended to be used for office
developments.  Specific objectives of the Office/Research District are as
follows:
   (a)   Establish business activities which are at present underdeveloped.
   (b)   Establish a transition between industrial and light commercial areas.
   (c)   Persons should not be permitted to reside in the Office/Research
District.
(Ord. 91-93. Passed 4-2-92)
1224.08  OBJECTIVES FOR PLANNED BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
   A mechanism for controlling and planning large multiple-use developments has
been established. This is the Planned Business Development, which enables a
large parcel with mixed uses to be developed in stages.  Essentially a large
parcel such as an office research parcel may be best developed with some
commercial or industrial uses which are consistent with the primary office
research. Internal use controls would assure that the subsidiary mixed use does
not detract from the primary use or interfere with adjoining parcels. The
objective of this District is to allow mixed use development in the Village.
(Ord. 91-93. Passed 4-2-92)
1224.09  OBJECTIVES FOR TRAFFIC PATTERNS AND ACCESS CONTROLS.
   (a)   The street pattern controls are intended to prevent any residential
street from becoming a through street or secondary artery connecting main
roads.
   (b)   The corporate line controls are to prevent areas beyond the zoning
control of the Village from using Evendale streets as primary or secondary
access ways for development uses inconsistent with detached single family
residences.
   (c)   The Street/Green Belt map permits a major artery to be built from
Glendale-Milford Road to the corner of Sharon and Mosteller Roads.  This would
serve two major objectives.  The first is to open remaining general industrial
land to development.  The second, and equally important, is to provide better
access to I-275 frown existing industries in the Village of Evendale.
   (d)   The final objective is to preserve both Cooper and Glendale-Milford
Roads east of Reading Road as streets with single-family detached residences.
Once the Cross County Highway is completed, commercial vehicle usage of
Glendale-Milford east of Reading Road should be restricted or curtailed.
(Ord. 91-93. Passed 4-2-92)
1224.10  OBJECTIVES FOR LAND AND PROPERTY REDEVELOPMENT.
   Specific objectives for all areas except Residential are as follows:
   (a)   Vacant building(s) which are offered for sale on the real estate
market should be sold within one year from the listing date.  After the one-
year limit has expired the Planning Commission should conduct a study of the
building(s) for possible referral to developers or to Village Council. Village
Council should exercise the options for purchase and subsequent redevelopment,
or leaving the building(s) on the market.
   (b)   Vacant building(s) which are not offered for sale on the real estate
market are the responsibility of the owner.  The external appearance of those
vacant building(s) is to be reviewed and reported to the owner at one-year
intervals by the Planning Commission Architectural Review Board relative to the
visual standards of other buildings in the area.
(Ord. 91-93. Passed 4-2-92)
1224.11  SCOPE OF PLAN.
   All development in the Village, whether proposed by a private developer or
the Village itself, is expected to comply with the goals and objectives set
forth above.
(Ord. 91-93. Passed 4-2-92)

1240.03  JURISDICTION.
   This Zoning Code shall apply to all land, structures and uses within the

(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1240.04  INTERPRETATION.
   (a)   The provisions of this Code shall be construed to achieve the purposes
for which they are adopted.  In interpreting and applying the provisions of
this Code, these provisions shall be held to be the minimum requirements for
the promotion of the public health, safety, morals, convenience, comfort,
prosperity and general welfare.
   (b)   It is not intended by this Code to interfere with or abrogate or annul
any easements, covenants, building restrictions or other agreements between
parties. However, where this Code imposes a greater restriction upon the use of
buildings or premises or upon the height of buildings, or requires larger open
spaces than are imposed or required by other laws, rules, regulations or
permits, or by easements, covenants, building restrictions or agreements, the
provisions of this Code shall govern. In the event of a conflict between the
text of these provisions and any caption, figure, illustration, table, or map,
the text of these provisions shall control. Additional rules of interpretation
for terms and words are found in §
1242.01.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1240.05  APPLICABILITY.
   This Code applies to all land uses, structures, subdivisions, and

this Code, for any person to establish or construct any land use or structure,
except in compliance with the requirements of this Code.
   (b)   Existing Land Uses or Structures. The requirements of this Code are
not retroactive in their effect on land uses or structures lawfully established
before the effective date of this Code or any applicable amendment.  Existing
land uses or structures are lawful and not in violation of the Evendale
Municipal Code only when operated and maintained in compliance with all
applicable provisions of this Code. Any alteration, expansion or modification
of existing land uses or structures shall comply with all provisions of this
Code.
   (c)   Subdivision of Land.  Any subdivision of land proposed within the
Village after the effective date of this Code shall be consistent with this
Code and
Chapter 1222 (Subdivision Regulations) of the Evendale Municipal Code.
   (d)   Effect of Zoning Code Amendments on Projects in Progress.  All land

to be complete before the effective date of this Code, or any amendment to this
Code, will be processed in compliance with the requirements in effect when the
application was accepted as complete.
   (e)   Other Permits and Requirements.  Nothing in this Code eliminates the
need for obtaining any other permits required by the Village, or any permit or
approval required by other provisions of the Evendale Municipal Code or the
laws, rules or regulations of any Village department, or any county, regional,
state, or federal agency.
   (f)   Conflicting Permits and Licenses. All permits shall be issued by the
Village in compliance with the provisions of this Code after the effective date
of this Code or any amendment to this Code.  Any permit issued in conflict with
this Code shall be void.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1240.06  RELATIONSHIP TO COMPREHENSIVE MASTER PLAN.
   This Zoning Code is the primary means by which the Village can implement its
Comprehensive Master Plan and accomplish the long-range goals that its citizens
have for the development and redevelopment of their community. Although the
Comprehensive Master Plan does not control all zoning decisions, it should be
followed to the extent that is reasonable and practicable, taking into account
the current facts and circumstances.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1240.07  SEVERABILITY.
   It is the intent of the Village of Evendale that nothing in this Code shall
be construed to conflict with the laws of the State of Ohio or to limit
additional requirements, if any, imposed by law. This Code and the various
chapters, sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases are severable; if
any chapter, section, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this Code shall
be declared unconstitutional by the degree of any court of competent
jurisdiction, such constitutionality shall not affect any of the remaining
chapters, sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases of this Code.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1240.08  REPEAL OF PREEXISTING CODE.
   (a)   The Evendale Zoning Code adopted by the Village of Evendale as
Ordinance No. 04-56 on August 12, 2004, and as subsequently amended, together
with the Zoning Map which is a part of that Zoning Code, is hereby superseded
and amended to read as set forth in this Code. However, this Code, including
the Zoning Map, shall be deemed a continuation of the previous Code, and not a
new enactment, insofar as the substance of revisions of the previous Code is
included in this Code, whether in the same or different language; and this Code
shall be so interpreted upon all questions of construction relating to tenure
of officers and board established by the previous Code, to questions of
conforming and nonconforming uses and structures, and to questions as to the
dates upon which such uses or structures become conforming or nonconforming.
   (b)   To the extent that this Code reestablishes a zoning district of the
same land use category and with the same district designation and name, this
district and its boundaries as indicated on the Zoning Map under the
preexisting Zoning Code shall be deemed as continuing until such time as it may
be amended pursuant to the provisions of this Code. To the extent that this
Code establishes a zoning district of the same land use category, but different
name from that under the preexisting Code, this new district name shall replace
the old zoning district name on the Zoning Map, but shall retain its existing
boundaries. A zoning district that is not reestablished by this Code is hereby
repealed as of the effective date of this Code.
   (c)   Zoning districts established by this Code in addition to the zoning
districts established under the preexisting Zoning Code shall become effective
upon the adoption of such Zoning Map amendments by the Village Council as are
necessary to give effect to the new districts.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1240.09  EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This Code shall be in full force and effect from and after the earliest
period allowed by law and, in accordance with §
1240.08, Repeal of Preexisting Code, shall supersede the regulations and Zoning
Map of the Zoning Code initially effective, and as subsequently amended.

1244.03  DESIGN GUIDELINES OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   Per §
1270.03(a)(4), the Planning Commission shall consider the most recently adopted
version of the Evendale Design Guidelines in its review of applications that
fall within this district.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1244.05  MAP OF ZONING DISTRICTS.
   Map Incorporated.  The location and boundaries of the base and planned unit
development districts established by this Code are as shown on a map entitled
“Zoning Map of the Village of Evendale, Ohio” hereinafter referred to as the
Zoning Map, which by this reference is incorporated as part of this Code.  All
notations, references and other information shown on the Zoning Map, and all
amendments thereto, shall be as much a part of this Code as if specifically set
forth and literally described herein.
   (a)   Omitted Land.  It is the intent of this Code that the entire area of
the Village be included in the districts established by this Code. Any area
lying within the Village but not shown on the Zoning Map as being included in
such a district shall be deemed to be, and it is hereby, classified in the
Residential District.
   (b)   Maintenance and Availability of Zoning Map.  The official copy of the
Zoning Map shall be maintained by the Village and shall be available for public
inspection during Village business hours at the Village Hall.  Any amendment to
zoning district boundaries or any change in any information shown on the Zoning
Map made by amendment to this Code shall be indicated on the official copy of
the Zoning Map.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1244.07  INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   In the event that any uncertainty exists with respect to the intended
boundaries of the various districts as shown on the Zoning Map, the following
rules shall apply:
   (a)   Centerlines. The district boundaries are the centerlines of highways,
streets, alleys, and other rights-of-way unless otherwise indicated. When the
designation of a boundary line on the Zoning Map coincides with the location of
any such right-of-way, the center line of such right-of-way shall be construed
to be the boundary of such district.
   (b)   Lot Lines.  When a district boundary does not coincide with the
location of the centerline of any right-of-way but does coincide with a lot
line, such lot line shall be construed to be the boundary of such district.
   (c)   Scale.  When a district boundary does not coincide with the location
of the centerline of any right-of-way or lot line, the district boundary shall
be determined by the use of the scale shown on the Zoning Map.
   (d)   Uncertainty. If any uncertainty remains as to the location of a
district boundary or other feature shown on the Zoning Map, the Building
Commissioner has the duty to determine the location.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1244.09  NUMBER OF PRINCIPAL STRUCTURES ON A ZONING LOT WITHIN DISTRICTS.
   Unless otherwise indicated in this Zoning Code, not more than one principal
structure shall be located on a zoning lot within the zoning districts
established in §
1244.01.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1244.11  ANNEXED LAND.
   (a)   Annexation of Land.  All land annexed to the Village after the
effective date of this Code shall be classified automatically in the
Residential District upon such annexation.
   (b)   Application for Different Classification.  When any land is classified
pursuant to this section, it shall remain so classified unless and until an
application to amend such classification is filed and approved pursuant to
Chapter 1286, Amendments.  Such application may be filed prior to or
contemporaneously with the annexation of the land in question.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1244.13  METHODS OF MEASUREMENT.
   The following explain how various measurements referenced in this Zoning
Code are to be calculated.
   (a)   Distances. The distances are measured horizontally. When determining
distances for setbacks and structure dimensions, all distances are measured
along a horizontal plane from the appropriate line, edge of building,
structure, storage area, parking area or other object. These distances are not
measured by following the topography of the land. When measuring a required
distance, such as the minimum distance between a structure and a lot line, the
measurement is made at the closest or shortest distance between the two
objects. Exceptions to this rule are as follows:
      (1)   Measurement of vehicle stacking or travel areas. Measurement of a
minimum travel distance for vehicles, such as garage entrance setbacks and
stacking lane distances, is measured down the center of the vehicle travel
area. For example, curving driveways and travel lanes are measured along the
arc of the driveway or traffic lane.
      (2)   Measurements involving a structure. Measurements involving a
structure are made to the closest wall of the structure. Chimneys, eaves and
bay windows up to 12 feet in length, are not included in the measurement. Other
features, such as covered porches and entrances, are included in the
measurement.
      (3)   Underground structures. Structures or portions of structures that
are entirely underground are not included in measuring required distances.
   (b)   Fractions. When calculations result in fractions the results are
rounded as follows:
      (1)   Minimum requirements. When a regulation is expressed in terms of a
minimum requirement, any fractional result over 0.5 is rounded up to the next
consecutive whole number.
      (2)   Maximum limits. When a regulation is expressed in terms of maximum
limits, any fractional result will be rounded down to the next lower whole
number.
   (c)   Structure Height.
      (1)   Principal structure height is measured from the finished grade at
the building line, if higher to the top of the cornice of flat roofs, or to the
deck line of a mansard roof, or to the mid-height of the highest gable or
dormer in a pitched or hipped roof, or, if there are no gables or dormers, to
the mid-height of a pitched or hipped roof.
      (2)   If the finished grade at the building line varies, the point from
which height is measured is the average of the highest and lowest elevation of
the building line at grade.
      (3)   Other structures. The height of other structures such as fences is
the vertical distance from the ground level immediately under the structure to
the top of a structure. Special measurement provisions are also provided below.
         A.   Measuring height of fences on top of retaining walls. Fences on
the top of retaining walls are measured from the top of the retaining wall.
         B.   Measuring height of decks. Deck height is determined by measuring
from the ground to the top of the floor of the deck if there is no rail, and
from the average finished grade to the top of the rails for all other
situations.
         C.   Building and mechanical equipment. Upon approval of the Planning
Commission, building and mechanical equipment within the Commercial,
Industrial, Office Research or Public Facilities Districts may be placed on the
roof of structures resulting in a combined structure and equipment height that
exceeds the height limit within the respective district, provided:
            1.   The equipment itself does not exceed ten feet in height;
            2.   The equipment is set back a minimum of 15 feet from exterior
walls; and
            3.   The equipment is adequately screened from view.
   (d)   Lot Width. The horizontal distance between the side lot lines as
measured from the midpoint of one side lot line to the midpoint of the other
side lot line.
   (e)   Minimum and Maximum Separation Distance. In cases where a minimum or
maximum separation distance applies, the minimum or maximum distance is
measured in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures, from the
closest property line of the use being regulated to the closest property line,
district boundary line or use from which the minimum or maximum distance is
required.

1248.09   Supplemental regulations.
1248.01  PURPOSE.
   The Commercial District regulations are intended to provide sufficient areas
in appropriate and convenient locations for business activities and the
exchange of goods and services.  Development within the Commercial Districts
shall be consistent with the most current Comprehensive Plan adopted by the
Village. The districts will encourage quality and variety in building and
landscape design as well as compatibility in use and form. Existing commercial
districts shall be maintained and enhanced, giving special consideration to
types of uses, scale, intensity and access. Appropriate standards are
established for reviewing proposals for new development and redevelopment in
commercial areas for compatibility with the surrounding development patterns.
   (a)   The GC General Commercial District is intended to provide locations
for commercial uses which share vehicular traffic characteristics and are
generally patronized on single purpose trips.
   (b)   The HC Heavy Commercial District is intended to provide for a variety
of commercial uses which share the common characteristic of being large-scale
and in some cases, requiring outdoor display or storage of materials,
merchandise or inventory. These uses have the need for larger expanses of land
than uses within the GC General Commercial District.

1250.01  PURPOSE.
   Development in the Industrial Districts should be consistent with the most
current Comprehensive Master Plan adopted by the Village. These districts are
established in areas of the Village generally adjoining railroads, interstates
and major vehicular thoroughfares, and are situated in such a manner so as not
to adversely affect adjacent residential neighborhoods. More specifically, each
individual industrial district has the following purpose:
   (a)   ITC District. The ITC Industrial Truck Center District is intended to
provide for the location of truck terminals and related general storage and
warehouse operations in an area with good interstate accessibility without
greatly affecting the levels of heavy truck traffic throughout the Village. 
   (b)   GI District. The GI General Industrial District is intended to provide
appropriate locations for a wide range of intensive industrial uses, including
fabrication, manufacturing, processing, packaging, assembly and bulk storage,
while also providing for uses that will benefit from the district's proximity
to the railroad.
   (c)   IF-1 District. The IF-1 Industrial Flex 1 District is intended to
create a high quality mix of light manufacturing, distribution, office,
research and development and other related industrial and office uses in
campus-like surroundings, while also providing for uses that will benefit from
the district's proximity to the railroad.
   (d)   IF-2 District. The IF-2 Industrial Flex 2 District is intended to
create a high quality mix of light manufacturing, distribution, office,
research and development and other related industrial and office uses in areas
that have a development pattern that is smaller in scale than that of ITC, GI
and IF-1.

that a use is permitted only after review and approval by the Planning
Commission pursuant to
Chapter 1282 Conditional Uses. “P-A” indicates that the use is permitted only
in conjunction with, and subordinate to, another use that is permitted or
conditional within the industrial district in which it is listed.
   All use classifications which are either not listed in
Schedule 1250.05, or that are indicated by an “X”, are prohibited. All
conditional and permitted uses may be subject to additional regulations as
indicated within the notes of the schedule or elsewhere in this Code. Use

   Except as otherwise provided in this section, off-street parking stalls for
each newly established principal use on a parcel shall be provided according to
the units of measurements indicated for that use in
Schedule 1258.04, Formula for Minimum Parking Stalls Required.
   (a)   Computation of Required Stalls. The following provision shall govern
the computation of the number of off-street parking stalls required.
      (1)   If more than one distinct use exists on any one parcel or in one
structure, the parking requirements for each will be calculated separately,
unless otherwise indicated as a single use within this Code.
      (2)   When the calculation of minimum required parking stalls for a
particular use results in a fractional number, any fraction up to 1/2 shall be
disregarded, and any fraction of 1/2 or more shall be rounded up to the next
consecutive whole number.
      (3)   In any places of assembly in which the seats in the auditorium or
assembly area consist of benches, pews or other similar seating facilities, and
the number of seats is a factor in the calculation of the minimum required
parking stalls, for the purpose of determining the minimum number of required
parking stalls, each 20 inches of such seating facilities shall be counted as
one seat.
      (4)   In any places of assembly in which there is no fixed seating, and
the number of seats is a factor in the calculation of the minimum required
parking stalls, for the purposes of calculations the minimum number of required
parking stalls, the number of seats in the assembly area shall be determined by
the fire code capacity.
      (5)   When parking stall requirements are calculated on the number of
faculty, staff, students or employees, the maximum number likely to be present
at any one time shall govern.
      (6)   For uses not expressly listed in
Schedule 1258.04 Formula for Minimum Parking Stalls Required, parking stalls
shall be provided on the same basis as required for the most similar use as
determined by the Village Council pursuant to
Chapter 1280.
      (7)   For the purposes of
Schedule 1258.04, unless indicated otherwise, a reference to floor area in the
parking stall quantity calculations means the floor area within the principal
structure devoted to the use.
   (b)   Spaces for the Handicapped.  Handicapped-accessible parking stalls
shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of the Ohio Building Code
and may be counted as part of the minimum parking stall requirements of this
chapter.
   (c)   Shared Parking.
      (1)   Joint use of up to 50% of required parking stalls may be permitted
for two or more uses located on the same parcel or adjacent parcels, provided
that:
         A.   There is no street between the two lots;
         B.   Pedestrian access is available from the shared parking stalls to
the use they are intended to serve;
         C.   The shared parking stalls are located no more than 300 feet from
the uses they are intended to serve; and
         D.   The applicant can demonstrate to the Village that the uses will
not substantially overlap in hours of operation or in demand for the shared
stalls.
      (2)   Written confirmation of arrangement. The shared parking arrangement
shall be guaranteed by a written agreement from the owner or between the owners
involved and all future owners or assigns which shall be submitted with the
required plan. 
      (3)   Method of measurement for purposes of shared parking arrangements. 
The maximum 300-foot distance permitted pursuant to §
1258.04(c)(1)C. between shared parking stalls and the use they are intended to
serve shall be calculated by determining the shortest traversable pedestrian
path from the nearest shared parking stall to the closest entrance to the use
intended to be served. This shall include sidewalks and off-street parking
areas, but shall exclude public vehicular right-of-way, landscaped areas
without pedestrian paths, and other areas not intended for pedestrian travel.

(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1260.03  LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS FOR NONRESIDENTIAL USES.
   The Planning Commission may require additional landscaping to soften the
appearance of building masses and reduce the impact of large paved areas of any
nonresidential property in any zoning district where those building masses or
large paved areas are visible from adjacent roads or properties.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1260.04  BUFFER REQUIREMENTS, THOROUGHFARES AND DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   (a)   Buffer Plan Required. For any landscaped buffer required by this
chapter a plan shall be submitted to the Planning Commission to review for
compliance with these regulations and any other application regulations. The
plan shall show the location of driveway entrances, provisions for vehicular
and pedestrian circulation, the location of sidewalks on or adjacent to the
property, the location of utilities, barriers, shelters and signs, the location
of landscaped areas and the types and location of vegetation to be planted in
them and any other relevant information requested by the Planning Commission.
   (b)   Types of Buffers. The following types of landscaped buffers shall be
required, as applicable, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
      (1)   Thoroughfare buffer.
         A.   Purpose. The purpose of a thoroughfare buffer is to shield or
enhance views into a parking lot, establish coordination among diverse
buildings, setbacks and uses, to retain the quality of the environment by
providing appropriate vertical mass in keeping with dimensions of horizontal
voids, and to diminish the presence of wires/poles, lights and other clutter
along the public right-of-way.
         B.   Thoroughfare buffer requirements.  All parcels with frontage on a
thoroughfare as defined in §
1242.04 shall provide a landscaped buffer along the property line abutting the
right-of-way of the public road when developed or redeveloped.
            1.   General provisions.
               a.   The thoroughfare buffer shall have a depth of ten feet or
greater, shall be located adjacent to the right-of-way and shall extend along
the entire road frontage.
               b.   No parking or pavement shall be allowed in the thoroughfare
buffer except for intersecting drives or required walkways.
                     Landscape material shall be required in accordance with
Figure 1260.04(A).
               c.   The thoroughfare buffer is subject to the limitations in §
1260.08 regarding clear sight triangle distance.
            2.   Determination of thoroughfare buffer requirements.  To
determine the required landscape materials the following procedure shall be
followed:
               Determine width of buffer.  Although the width of the buffer is
typically measured parallel to the property line, design variations are
allowed. The options for landscape material minimum quantity requirements as
found in
Figure 1260.04(A) are given as minimum number of plants required per 100 linear
feet.
               a.   Determine the length of a required thoroughfare buffer.
Measure the length along the street right-of-way that requires the buffer and
subtract any length covered by a clear sight triangle under §
1260.08.
               Determine thoroughfare landscape material quantity requirements.
Divide the length of the required thoroughfare buffer by 100.  Multiply the
result by the number of plants for the required thoroughfare buffer shown in
Figure 1260.04(A).
               b.   All thoroughfare landscape material quantity requirements
shall remain within the designated area and shall otherwise meet the standards
of the thoroughfare buffer.
               Thoroughfare buffers.  The minimum landscaping in thoroughfare
buffers shall be provided in accordance with
Figure 1260.04(A).

      (2)   Greenbelt/district boundary buffer. The greenbelt/district boundary
buffer shall comply with the following requirements:
         A.   Purpose.  The greenbelt/boundary buffer is for the purpose of
reducing the potential conflicts between residential uses and nonresidential
uses.
         B.   Requirements of the greenbelt and district boundary buffer.
            1.   Rear yard buffer yard. Where a parcel in the OR, GC or HC
district abuts the R Residential District on its rear lot line, that parcel is
required to have a minimum 60-foot deep rear setback.
            2.   Side yard buffer yard. Where a parcel in the OR, GC or HC
district abuts the R Residential District on its side lot line, that parcel is
required to have a minimum 60-foot deep side setback.
            3.   Obstruction prohibited. Structures, pavement, signage, and all
other site improvements are prohibited within the required greenbelt/boundary
buffer yard.
   Minimum landscaping materials. The greenbelt/boundary buffer yard shall be
landscaped with at least the minimum number of plantings as indicated in
Figure 1260.04(B).  Existing trees and shrubs may be counted toward the
requirements if they meet the standards established in §
1260.07.

         C.   Additional standards for relief.  In addition to the relief that
Planning Commission is authorized to give per the criteria in §
1260.10, Planning Commission may also consider the following factors in
reducing or eliminating the greenbelt buffer.
            1.   The presence of considerable changes in topography on either
the residential or commercial properties that provide for a natural buffer
between the uses;
            2.   The R-zoned parcel or parcels which the subject property abuts
consist of Village-owned park, farm, or conservation land; and
            3.   Where the applicant of the subject property donates a portion
of the parcel as greenbelt to the Village in accordance with the requirements
of the following §
1260.04(b)(2)D.
         D.   Procedure for granting a reduction in minimum greenbelt/district
boundary buffer area in connection with a donation of greenbelt land to
village.
            1.   The applicant of the subject property shall submit a site plan
to the body from whom the greenbelt reduction is granted that shows the
proposed lot split of the greenbelt parcel from the subject property.
            2.   The body from whom the applicant is seeking the reduction in
greenbelt depth may condition the reduction or variance upon the successful
subdivision and transfer of the greenbelt parcel to the Village.
            3.   When so conditioned, no certificate of occupancy of any type
may be transferred until the applicant obtains approval of the lot split or

(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13; Ord. 18-07. Passed 3-13-18.)
1260.05  OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS. 
   All off-street parking within the General Commercial, Heavy Commercial, and
Office/Research Districts shall comply with the following landscaping
requirements:
   (a)   Landscaping for Off-Street Parking Areas.
      (1)   Applicability.  This section applies to all parking lots in the
General Commercial, Heavy Commercial, and Office/Research Districts.
         A.   Exemption:
            1.   Vehicular use areas containing less than 20 parking spaces
shall be exempt from the requirements of this section.
            2.   Where the total parking provided is located in more than one
location on a site and each location contains less than 20 parking spaces, each
such area shall be exempt from this §
1260.05 if separated on all sides by at least 20 feet of non-paved area.
         B.   Alteration or expansion.  Where a vehicular use area is altered
or expanded and thereby contains 20 or more contiguous parking spaces,
landscaping for the entire area shall be provided and not merely to the extent
of its expansion.
      (2)   Perimeter landscaping. Perimeter landscaping shall be located in a
perimeter strip which shall surround the entire parking lot except where
adjacent to the main building and as provided in §
1260.05(a)(1)A. The edge of the parking lot shall be the edge of the perimeter
strip. The landscape perimeter strip shall have a minimum width of ten feet. No
parking or pavement is allowed in the perimeter strip except for intersecting
drives and required walkways. One tree is required for 50 linear feet of
perimeter.  If a perimeter area coincides with a buffer area, buffer
requirements shall control landscaping requirements.
      (3)   Landscaping standards in parking lots.  Interior landscaping shall
comply with the following standards:
         A.   Design.  Landscape areas should be peninsular or island types.
         B.   Maximum spacing. The maximum distance between landscape areas
shall be 180 feet.
         C.   Minimum  landscape area requirement. The minimum square feet of
landscaped area required for the interior of the entire parking area is one
square foot per one parking stall or 100 square feet, whichever is less.
         D.   Determination of minimum required interior landscape materials. 
The interior landscape requirements shall be computed as follows:
   Planting Requirements.  See
Figure 1260.05(B).
            1.   Credit for existing vegetation.  Existing trees and shrubs may
be counted toward the requirements if they meet the standards established in §
1260.07.
         E.   Distribution.  Interior landscape areas shall be evenly
distributed through the interior of the parking lot.
         F.   Surface. Any landscape area provided under this section shall not
contain bare soil. Any ground area shall be covered with stones, mulch,
vegetative ground cover, or other surface permeable by water.
   Minimum width. Interior landscaped areas between parking aisles and stalls
shall have a minimum dimension of 2.5 feet pervious overhang area adjacent to
stalls or 2.5 feet wheel stop clearance adjacent to stalls, and a planting area
that is at least six feet in width, as shown in
Figure 1260.05(A).
         G.   Traffic visibility.  No landscaping shall obscure visibility at
vehicular intersections with the parking area or other areas where clear
visibility is necessary to assure safe circulation. Where safe visibility is
impaired, canopy trees shall have branches removed from the trunk at least five
feet above the ground and shrubs or groundcover shall not exceed two feet in
height. Evergreen trees and understory trees that would impair visibility for
safe circulation shall not be planted in these areas.

   (b)   Landscaping for Off-Street Loading Areas.
      (1)   Screening of loading areas.  Except for parcels located within
industrial districts, if a there is a dock associated with the loading area of
an establishment, and it is visible from a public street, then Planning
Commission may require that all operations, materials, and vehicles within any
loading space shall be screened.
      (2)   Screening of loading space. The screening material shall be at
least six feet in height, 100% opaque, and must meet the following
requirements:
         A.   Planting requirements.  To be counted towards screening
requirements, evergreen trees and evergreen shrubs shall be planted in
accordance with the following spacing guidelines:
            1.   Evergreen trees should be planted 15 feet on center.
            2.   Evergreen shrubs should be planted not more than five feet on
center.
         B.   Combination of materials. Plant material may be used in
conjunction with fences, walls and berms but the overall effect shall be a
continuous 100% opaque screen at maturity.  Plants must be planted in rows or
be staggered, but the overall effect shall be a 100% opaque screen at maturity.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1260.06  SIGNAGE LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS
   (a)   Districts. A ground, monument, or pole sign that is required to comply
with this Code per §
1262.02 Scope, must also be landscaped if it is located in one of the following
districts:
      (1)   Residential District R;
      (2)   Public Facilities District PF;
      (3)   Industrial Flex-1 District IF-1 along Medallion Drive and South
Medallion Drive only;
      (4)   General Commercial District GC;
      (5)   Heavy Commercial District HC; or
      (6)   Office-Research District OR.
   (b)   Minimum Landscaped Area. The signage landscaped area shall surround
the base of the sign and be no less than three feet in width around the entire
perimeter of the base of the sign.
   (c)   Review and Approval.  If the proposed sign is part of a site plan that
is to be reviewed by the Planning Commission, the landscaping plan shall be
approved by the Planning Commission.  If a proposed sign does not require any
review or approval other than those required from the Building Commissioner,
such signage landscaping shall be approved by the Building Commissioner.
   (d)   Reduction of Signage Landscaping Requirements. Planning Commission may
reduce the landscaping requirement by up to 100% in instances where the
orientation of the sign impedes compliance with these signage landscaping
requirements and where the applicant has otherwise substantially complied with
the requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1260.07  CREDIT FOR EXISTING PLANT MATERIALS.
   Every three existing trees per 100 feet having a diameter at breast height
of at least four inches shall be counted as one standard plant unit as required
within any buffer or landscaping area; provided, however, that such trees must
be located within the area of the required buffer or landscaped yard.  Every
smaller tree may be counted as one required plant within a standard plant unit;
provided, however, that no tree shorter than six feet in height may be counted.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1260.08  CLEAR SIGHT DISTANCE AT STREET AND ACCESS ROAD INTERSECTIONS.
   (a)   Purpose.  To ensure that landscape materials do not constitute a
driving hazard, a clear sight triangle will be observed at all street
intersections or intersections of driveways with streets.
      (1)   Definition. A “clear sight triangle” is the triangular area formed
by a diagonal line connecting two points located on intersecting right-of-way
lines (or a right-of-way line and the edge of an access road), each point being
35 feet from the intersection, and the two intersecting right-of-way lines (or
a right-of-way line and an access road).  See
Figure 1260.08(A).
      (2)   Design. The entire area of the clear sight triangle should be
designed as illustrated in
Figure 1260.08(A) to provide the driver of the vehicle entering the
intersection with an unobstructed view to all points nine feet above the
roadway along the centerline.  The recommended distance depends upon the design
speed of the higher-order street and therefore is greater for arterial streets
than for collectors.
   (b)   Restrictions Within Clear Sight Triangles.  Within the sight triangle
no landscape material with a height greater than 12 inches shall be permitted
with the exception of trees which conform to the following standards. Trees
shall be permitted within the sight triangles as long as, except during early
growth stages, only the tree trunk (no limbs, leaves, etc.) is visible between
the ground and nine feet above the ground, or otherwise does not present a
traffic visibility hazard. Restrictions shall not apply to the following:
      (1)   Existing natural grades which, by reason of natural topography,
rise 12 or more inches above the level of the center of the adjacent
intersection;
      (2)   Fire hydrants, public utility poles, street markers, governmental
signs, and traffic control devices.

(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1260.09  OVERLAP OF LANDSCAPE REQUIREMENTS
   When this chapter subjects any portion of the parcel to more than one type
of landscaping requirement, the more stringent requirement shall control.  The
more stringent requirement is that which requires the highest fence, wall or
screen or, if no fence, wall or screen is required, the requirement with the
greatest quantity of landscaping.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1260.10  MODIFICATIONS TO LANDSCAPED AREAS AND BUFFER YARDS.
   In order to protect landscaping features or natural growth areas that the
Planning Commission determines to be in the best interest of the Village to
preserve, the Planning Commission may reduce any landscaped area required by
Chapter 1260 by no more than 10%, unless a greater reduction is otherwise
authorized by this chapter.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)

   (a)   Illumination.
      (1)   Location and design of light source.  Whenever an external
artificial light source is used for a sign, such source shall be located,
shielded, and directed so as to not be directly visible from any public street
or private residence. No receptacle or device housing a permitted light source
shall protrude more than 18 inches from the face of the sign or building to
which it is attached.
      (2)   Level of illumination.  In no event shall the illumination of any
sign, resulting from any internal or external artificial light source, exceed
50 foot candles when measured with a standard light meter held perpendicular to
the sign face at a distance equal to the narrowest dimension of such face. All
artificial illumination shall be so designed, located, shielded, and directed
as to illuminate only the sign face or faces and to prevent the casting of
glare or direct light upon adjacent property or streets.
      (3)   Signs adjacent to residential areas.  Any illuminated sign located
on a lot abutting or across a street from, and visible from, any residentially
zoned area, shall not be illuminated from the hours of 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.,
except that such sign may remain illuminated during such time as the activity
to which the sign pertains is open for business so long as such sign is not a
public or private nuisance.
      (4)   Flashing lights prohibited. Except for public service signs when
expressly permitted by this section, no flashing, blinking, or intermittent
lights shall be permitted.
   (b)   Structural Elements. The construction and structural components of all
signs shall be in accordance with the standards and regulations of the Village
Building Code.
   (c)   Minimum Height of Certain Signs. The bottom of every awning, canopy,
flat sign and wall sign shall be elevated at least eight feet above grade. Wall
signs on the same façade shall maintain the same top and bottom elevations
above grade.
   (d)   Minimum Setback. Except as otherwise provided, no sign shall be closer
than ten feet to a right-of-way or six feet from a side lot line.
   (e)   Obstruction of Access Ways. No sign or sign structure shall obstruct
free ingress to or egress from a fire escape, door, window, or other required
access way.
   (f)   Traffic Safety.
      (1)   Confusion with traffic signals. No sign shall be maintained at any
location whereby reason of its position, size, shape, content, color, or
illumination it may obstruct, impair, obscure, interfere with the view of, or
be confused with any traffic control sign, signal, or device or where it may
interfere with, mislead, or confuse traffic.
      (2)   Obstruction of sight triangles prohibited.  No sign, nor any part
of a sign other than a supporting pole or brace no greater than 18 inches in
width or diameter, shall be located lower than eight feet from grade within the
area of any sight triangle, as defined in §
1262.03 of this chapter, in districts where pole signs are allowed.
   (g)   Signs in Rights-of-Way.  No sign, except governmental signs, shall be
placed in or extend into or over any public property or public right-of-way.
   (h)   Sign Maintenance.  The owner of a sign and the owner of the premises
on which such sign is located shall be jointly and severally liable to maintain
such sign, including its illumination sources, in compliance with this Code and
applicable laws, in a safe and secure condition, and in neat and orderly
condition and good-working order at all times, and to prevent the development
of rust, corrosion, rotting, or other deterioration in the physical appearance
or safety of such sign. The premises around monument and pole signs shall be
kept clean and free of rubbish and weeds. No sign or sign structure shall be
maintained which, in the opinion of the Building Commissioner, is structurally
unsafe or constitutes a hazard to safety, health, and welfare by reason of
inadequate construction, maintenance, dilapidation or abandonment.
   (i)   Sign Measurement.
      (1)   Determination of sign face area.  The area of a sign shall be
determined by computing the entire area within a single polygon that completely
enclosed the sign face (i.e., the extreme limits of lettering, representations,
emblems or other figures, together with all surrounding material, color,
lighting, trim or ornamentation forming an integral part of the display or used
to differentiate the sign from the background from which it is placed) and in
which polygon no interior angle is greater than 180 degrees.
      (2)   Area of sign with more than one exterior face. The area of the sign
designed with more than one exterior face shall be computed as including 100%
of all sign face areas as defined above that are visible from any ground
position. A V-shaped sign whose interior angle is 90 degrees or less shall be
counted as two sign faces.
      (3)   Exceptions. In a residential development where the sign identifying
the name of the development is attached to a wall or fence, the area of the
entire wall or fence shall not be computed in determining the maximum sign
area.
   (j)   Signs on Lots with Multiple Users. When more than one user occupies a
zoning lot, the owner of that lot shall be responsible for allocating permitted
signage among such users.
   (k)   Sign Spacing. No sign shall be nearer than two feet to any other sign
or structure, other than a structure to which it is lawfully attached.

no sign shall be constructed or maintained in any area or in any manner so as
to create a nuisance or a threat to the public safety or welfare.

lot.

1263.03  APPLICATION PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Any person or company intending to apply for the placement or
operation of a wireless communications antenna or site within the Village shall
first schedule a pre-application conference with the Building Commissioner or
his or her assignee. At this conference, the prospective applicant must present
to the Building Commissioner or his or her assignee any proposed locations for
the equipment or site, also demonstrating the need for a tower and that all
alternatives to the construction of a new tower, such as co-location, have been
exhausted. This information should identify the area within which the tower may
be located, the maximum height of the proposed tower, and identify any possible
users that may co-locate at the site. The purpose of the pre-application
conference will be to evaluate the impact on adjacent areas and neighborhoods,
and to discuss possibilities of co-location, and other suitable sites.
   (b)   Upon completion of the pre-application conference, an application may
be filed with the office of the Building Commissioner. The application shall be
in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, and in compliance with all
applicable provisions of the Zoning Code except those in conflict with this
chapter, and in such form as approved by the Building Commissioner. If the
application does not conform with said provisions, the Building Commissioner
shall notify the applicant and no further consideration of the application
shall occur until it is in compliance with the terms of this chapter.
   (c)   Application Fee.
      (1)   Proposed location. The application fee for a wireless communication
system, tower, antenna, or site shall be a base application fee of $2,500 for
each proposed location. Additionally, the Village shall be reimbursed by
applicant for any additional costs above and beyond $2,500 that the Village
incurs through the use of professional services outside of Village employees
that are necessitated in order to effectively process the application. The
building permit for a proposed wireless communications system, tower, antenna
or site shall be withheld by the Building Commissioner until such time that the
applicant reimburses the Village for such additional costs.
      (2)   Proposed co-locator. The application fee for a wireless
communication system co-locator shall be $500 for each new user proposing to
co-locate.
      (3)   Upon compliance with the above application requirements:

not be subject to the setback requirements of other wireless communication
towers, provided it is placed on the roof of an existing building.
   (f)   All other uses accessory to the wireless communications antenna and
towers, including but not limited to business offices, maintenance depots, and
materials and vehicle storage, are prohibited from the site unless otherwise
permitted in the zoning district in which the wireless communications antenna
and/or tower is located.
(Ord. 12-64.  Passed 3-12-13; Ord. 18-16.  Passed 2-13-18.)
1263.05  STANDARDS FOR LOCATION.
   (a)   The following standards shall apply to all wireless communications
antennas and towers:
      (1)   The wireless communications company shall demonstrate, using the
latest technological evidence, why the antenna or tower must be placed in a
proposed location in order to serve its necessary function in the company's
grid system. Part of this demonstration shall include a drawing showing the
boundaries of the area around the proposed location which would probably also
permit the antenna to function properly in the company's grid system. This area
shall be considered the allowable zone.
      (2)   If the communications company proposes to build a wireless
communications tower (as opposed to mounting the antenna on an existing
structure), it is required to demonstrate that it has contacted the owners of
any nearby tall structures within the allowable district or area, asked for
permission to install the communications antenna on those structures, and was
denied for either non-economic reasons or that a clearly unreasonable economic
demand was made by the owner, based on prevailing market values.
   (b)   The Village may deny the application to construct a new wireless
communications tower if the applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount
the antenna on existing structures.
(Ord. 12-64.  Passed 3-12-13; Ord. 18-16.  Passed 2-13-18.)
1263.06  STANDARDS FOR APPROVAL.
   (a)   Antenna/Tower Height. The applicant shall demonstrate that the planned
height of a wireless communications tower is no higher than necessary to
function satisfactorily and to accommodate the co-location requirements as set
out in division (f) of this section. No tower that is taller than the necessary
height shall be approved, and the height of any tower to be greater than 200
feet must first be approved by the Planning Commission. Towers shall be
monopole construction unless it is demonstrated upon application that another
type of tower is required for safety purposes and it has been approved by the
Planning Commission.
   (b)   Setbacks from the Base of the Tower. If a new wireless communications
tower is to be constructed in an industrial zoning district, the minimum
distance between the base of the tower, or if so supported, between any guy
wire anchors supporting the tower, and any property line which abuts a zoning
district other than a residential district shall be no closer to that district
than the greater of 50% of the tower height or 50 feet.
   (c)   Incidental Equipment Housing and Structures. Any structures used to
house equipment that is incidental to the tower shall comply with the accessory
structure regulations of the district in which the tower is located to the
extent practicable.
   (d)   Wireless Communications Tower Safety.
      (1)   All wireless communications towers shall be fitted with anti-
climbing devices as approved by the manufacturers. Furthermore, the applicant
shall demonstrate that the proposed wireless communications tower and its
antenna are safe and that the surrounding properties will not be negatively
affected by tower failure, falling ice or other debris, electromagnetic fields
or radio frequency interference. However, if a specific safety issue in
question is determined to be regulated by either FCC Regulations or applicable
Building Code Regulations, and the operation or construction is in compliance
with such regulations, then this requirement for safety shall be deemed to have
been met.
      (2)   Subsequent to the installation of a wireless communications tower
site, if it is determined by the Village Council, upon presentation of proper
and sufficient documentation, and after a public hearing, that the operation of
a wireless communications tower is inherently dangerous or is a demonstrable
health hazard, the wireless communication tower shall be declared to be a
nuisance and all operation shall cease. The tower or antenna shall also be
removed as provided under Section
1263.08. However, no order of removal shall be made if it is inconsistent with
any provisions herein or with any existing FCC Regulations.
   (e)   Screening. A solid masonry wall or solid fence, not less nor more than
six feet in height, shall be required around the wireless communications tower
and its support structure(s), unless the antenna is mounted on an existing
structure.
   (f)   Landscaping. Landscaping in compliance with a plan approved by the
Planning Commission shall be provided to screen as much of the support
structure and ground level features as is possible. In addition, existing
vegetation on and around the site shall be preserved to the greatest extent
possible.
   (g)   Limiting the Number of Wireless Communications Towers.
      (1)   In order to reduce the number of antenna support structures needed
in the Village, the owner of an existing wireless communications tower shall
not unreasonably deny a request to accommodate other users, including other
wireless communications companies, and the antennas of local or joint police,
fire, ambulance and other emergency services. Nothing contained herein is
intended to prevent the owner of the existing wireless communications tower
from receiving reasonable compensation for the use of its tower by commercial
users.
      (2)   Unless waived for good cause by the Planning Commission to minimize
impact on adjoining property, for the purposes of encouraging co-location of
wireless antenna and other users, wireless communication towers shall be
designed, engineered, and constructed as follows:
         A.   Towers less than 75 feet tall shall be designed, engineered and
constructed to support antennas installed by at least two wireless
communication service users;
         B.   Towers more than 75 feet in height, but less than 150 feet shall
be designed, engineered and constructed to support antennas installed by at
least three wireless communication service users; and
         C.   Towers 150 feet in height or taller shall be designed, engineered
and constructed to support antennas installed by at least four wireless
communication service users.
      (3)   As used in divisions (g)(2)A. through (g)(2)C. hereof, the term
"users" shall include the antennas of police, fire and ambulance departments.
In addition, an applicant must demonstrate that the area acquired by lease or
otherwise acquired for the use and construction of the tower and accessory
structures is sufficient in size to accommodate any additional structures that
may be required if additional users are added to the tower.
   (h)   Licensing. The communications company must demonstrate to the Village
that it is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The owner
of the tower must also annually provide to the Village no later than January 31
of each year, and at such time as a new user is added, a list of all users of
the tower and each user shall provide the Village with a copy of that user's
license with the FCC. No approval will be granted to any applicant or user
unless proof of a current FCC license for the proposed use of the tower is
provided.
   (i)   Access/Required Parking. Access to the wireless communications site
shall be paved with concrete or asphalt, and the perimeter of the access drive
and parking lot shall be curbed. A parking space shall be provided for
maintenance workers.
   (j)   Appearance. Wireless communications towers under 200 feet in height
shall be painted silver or have a galvanized finish retained, or be finished
with a neutral color matching its background in order to reduce visual impact.
The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed wireless communication tower
is the least aesthetically intrusive facility for the neighborhood and
function. It is further recommended, that all buildings and structures be
architecturally compatible with the architecture of the adjacent buildings and
structures. Wireless communications towers shall meet all Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) regulations. Wireless communications towers may be
artificially lighted when required by the FAA. Furthermore, no wireless
communication tower or antenna and accessory buildings and structures shall
contain any signage except safety signage. All utility lines serving the towers
shall be underground, unless there is a demonstrated safety hazard created by
underground installation.
   (k)   Site Plan and Documentation Required. A full site plan shall be
required for all proposed wireless communications sites, except antennas to be
placed on existing structures, at a reasonable scale, but not smaller than one
inch to 20 feet (1 inch = 20 feet), indicating the following:
      (1)   The total area of the site and the identity of the owners(s).
      (2)   The existing zoning of the property in question and existing zoning
and ownership of all adjacent properties.
      (3)   All public and private right-of-way and easement lines located on
or adjacent to the property which is proposed to be continued, created,
relocated or abandoned.
      (4)   Existing topography with a maximum of five-foot contour intervals.
      (5)   The proposed finished grade of the development shown by contours
not exceeding five-foot intervals.
      (6)   The location of all existing buildings and structures and the
proposed location of the wireless communications tower and all wireless

or area nonconformity or increase the degree of nonconformity with any existing
parking, loading, bulk, yard or area requirement for such structure.
   (d)   Expansion of Use. A nonconforming use shall not be expanded, extended,
enlarged or increased in intensity. Such prohibited activity shall include,

use, or that is accessory to a nonconforming use, shall be moved, in whole or
in part for a distance whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any
other lot, unless both the structure and the use thereof shall thereafter
comply and conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is
located after being so moved; and
      (2)   No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part, for any
distance whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless
such use shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in
which it is located after being so moved.
   (f)   Change in Use. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to or replaced
with, in whole or in part, any use other than a use permitted in the zoning

reestablished in conformance with this Code, but the previously existing
nonconforming use shall not be restored unless it shall conform to all
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
      (2)   Damage to nonconforming structure - 50% or greater. Any structure
that houses a nonconforming use and that is damaged or destroyed, by any means,
to the extent of 50% or greater of the cost of replacement of such structure
new, the conforming structure may be reestablished in conformance with this
Code, but the previously existing nonconforming use shall not be restored
unless it shall conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it
is located.
      (3)   Damage to structure of less than 50% - time frame. If a structure
that is nonconforming or houses a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed by
any means not within the control of the owner thereof, to the extent of less
than 50% of the cost of replacement of such structure new, a building permit
shall be applied for within six months of the damage, and the structure may be
repaired or restored; provided, however, that no repair or restoration shall be
made that would create any new noncompliance not existing prior to such damage
or destruction, nor shall any repair or restoration except in compliance with
the applicable district regulations be made.
      (4)   Determination of extent of damage.  Replacement cost applicable to
§
1264.05(g)(1) and (2) above shall be determined by the Building Commissioner.
   (h)   Termination by Discontinuance of Nonconforming Use.
      (1)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, in whole or in part, is

resume such use, such use shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed. 
Any subsequent use or occupancy of such land or structure shall comply with the
use regulations of the zoning district in which such land or structure is
located.
      (2)   Any period of such discontinuance caused by government action,
strikes, material shortages or acts of God and without any contributing fault

1264.06(b) through (d).
   (b)   Repair, Maintenance, Alteration and Enlargement. Any nonconforming
structure may be repaired, maintained, altered or enlarged; provided, however,
that no such repair, maintenance, alteration or enlargement shall either create
any new nonconformity or increase the degree of the existing noncompliance of
all or any part of such structure.
   (c)   Moving. A nonconformity structure shall not be moved in whole or in
part, for any distance whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any
other lot unless the entire structure shall thereafter conform to the
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
   (d)   Damage or Destruction.
      (1)   Any nonconforming structure that is damaged or destroyed by any
means, to the extent of 50% or greater of the cost of replacement of such
structure new, shall not be restored unless it shall conform to all regulations
of the zoning district in which it is located.
      (2)   If a nonconforming structure that is damaged or destroyed, by any
means not within the control of the owner thereof, to the extent of less than
50% of the cost of replacement of such structure new, a building permit shall
be applied for within six months of the damage, and the structure may be
repaired or restored; provided, however, that no repair or restoration shall be
made that would create any new noncompliance not existing prior to such damage
or destruction, nor shall any repair or restoration except in compliance with
the applicable district regulations be made.

requirements of this Code, the following regulations shall apply:
   (a)   Parking. If the seating capacity or square footage occupied by the
building increases, or if the use changes so that more parking is required,
then all parking requirements of
Chapter 1258, Off-Street Parking and Loading, shall be met.
   (b)   Landscaping. If the landscaping requirements are not met, the owner of
the lot involved shall submit a landscaping plan for the completion of all
landscaping. The owner may do one of the following:
      (1)   Devote an amount of not less than 5% of the cost of the expansion
or new construction toward meeting the landscaping requirements of this Code;
or
      (2)   Complete all required landscaping required by this Code over a
period not to exceed three years with one third of the plan to be implemented
each year.  No new building permits will be issued until the landscaping plan
is fully complied with.
   (c)   Curb Cuts.  If the existing curb cuts are not in compliance with those
required by this Code, then all nonconforming curb cuts shall either be
eliminated or brought into compliance.
   (d)   Nonconforming Signs. A legal nonconforming sign may be continued as
long as it is kept in good repair and maintained in safe condition. A legal
nonconforming sign shall immediately lose its legal nonconforming status and

District.
   (e)   Satellite Dish and Antennas.
      (1)   Purpose and applicability.
         A.   The purpose of this division is to ensure that satellite dish and
antennas, other than those similar structures to which
Chapter 1263 apply, are neutral in color and, to the extent possible,
compatible in character and appearance with the surrounding neighborhood or
area of the zoning districts in which they are located.
         B.   In the Residential District, these provisions only apply to
satellite dishes or antennas greater than 24 inches in diameter.

consisting of a densely planted evergreen hedge of not less than six feet in
height, in combination with other landscaping materials.  Such screening shall
be provided between any such ground-mounted antenna or antenna support
structure and each lot line of the property on which such antennas or antenna
support structure is located so as to provide the maximum reasonably achievable
screening, as determined by the Building Commissioner, of such antenna and
antenna support structure from view from adjacent properties and public or
private streets.
   (f)   Outdoor Lighting.
      (1)   Purpose.  The regulations established in this division are designed
and intended to prevent excessive spillover of light and glare from the zoning
lot on which the light source is located.  The standards contained in this
division are deemed to be the minimum standards necessary to prevent nuisance
and adverse impacts on the public health, safety, and welfare;
      (2)   Outdoor lighting for single-family dwellings in the residential
district. Where lamp posts and similar lighting fixtures which are for the
purpose of illuminating walks and drives are used in conjunction with single-
family dwellings within the Residential District, the light may not exceed 0.5
foot candle at all property lines, with the exception of such lights that may
occur at driveway entrances, in which case they must not exceed 0.5 foot candle
at the street right-of-way line;
      (3)   Outdoor lighting in all nonresidential districts or for
nonresidential uses within the residential district.
         A.   Applicability.  All exterior lighting in nonresidential districts
and in conjunction with nonresidential uses occurring in the Residential
District, except street lighting and other Village-owned lighting, shall comply
with the following standards.
         B.   All outdoor lighting shall be designed and located such that the
maximum illumination measured in foot candles at the property line shall not
exceed 1.0.
         C.   All outdoor lighting for nonresidential uses shall be located,
screened, or shielded so that adjacent residential uses are not directly
illuminated.
         D.   No outdoor lighting shall be of such an intensity or brilliance
as to cause glare or to impair the vision of drivers.
         E.   The following factors shall be considered in the evaluation of
lighting plans:
            1.   Pole height
            2.   Type of luminaire
            3.   Site coverage - average maintained
            4.   Uniformity
            5.   Intensity at property line
   (g)   Home Occupations.
      (1)   Applicability. A home occupation as defined in
Chapter 1242 shall be permitted in the Residential district as an accessory use
to any permitted dwelling unit in accordance with the following standards.
      (2)   Employee limitations.
         A.   The entrepreneur of every home occupation shall be domiciled in

persons domiciled in the dwelling unit where such home occupation is conducted.
This limitation on the number of employees shall not apply to employees who do
not work at the dwelling unit devoted to such home occupation.
      (3)   Structural limitations.
         A.   No alteration of any kind shall be made to the dwelling unit
where a home occupation is conducted that would change its residential
character as a dwelling unit, including the enlargement of public utility
services beyond that customarily required for residential use.
         B.   No separate entrance shall be provided in connection with the
conduct of any home occupation.
      (4)   Operational limitations.
         A.   No more than a total of 600 square feet of floor area (exclusive
of garage floor area devoted to permissible parking of vehicles used in
connection with the home occupation) of any dwelling unit or any permitted
accessory structure shall be specially designed, arranged, or set apart for the
conduct of a home occupation; provided, however, that this division shall not
apply to a daycare home operated as home occupation.
         B.   No stock-in-trade shall be displayed or sold on the premises of
any home occupation.
         C.   No routine attendance of patients, clients, subcontractors, or
employees associated with any home occupation shall be allowed at the premises
of the home occupation, with the following exceptions:
            1.   Attendance of up to four persons at any one time may be
allowed for personal instruction services.
            2.   Attendance of up to six children at any one time may be

provisions of this Code, exclusive of use interpretations, and of any rule or
regulation issued pursuant to this Code.
      (2)   Purpose.  The interpretation authority established by this chapter
is intended to recognize that the provisions of this Code cannot address every
specific situation to which they may have to be applied. Many such situations,

provision of this Code in light of the general and specific purposes for which
those provisions have been enacted.  Because the interpretation authority

is not intended to add to or change the essential content of this Code but
rather is intended only to allow authoritative application of that content to
specific cases.

shall inform the applicant in writing of his or her interpretation, stating the
specific precedent, reasons, and analysis upon which the determination is
based. The failure of the Commissioner to act within 30 days, or such further
time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision denying
the application rendered on the date following such 30-day period.
         C.   Appeal. Appeals from interpretations rendered by the Building
Commissioner may be taken to the Zoning Board of Appeals pursuant to
Chapter 1284.
   (j)   Inspection and Enforcement.  In furtherance of the enforcement of this
Code, the Building Commissioner shall undertake such regular and continuing

or action shall be deemed an approval or a recommendation for approval, all
time periods shall be tolled during any period of non-payment, but shall
otherwise continue to run.

1280.04   Procedure.
1280.05   Standards for use interpretations.
1280.06   Effect of favorable use interpretation.
1280.01  AUTHORITY.
   The Village Council may render similar use interpretations of the provisions
of this Code in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. This
interpretation authority is established pursuant to the Village Council's
authority to act in an administrative capacity. Upon the Council making an
interpretation of similar use pursuant to the standards and procedures set
forth in this chapter, this Code shall thereafter be interpreted to include the
similar use for the zoning district or districts for which it was authorized,
and it is the duty of the Village Council to concurrently commence the filing
of an application for an amendment to the Code to be consistent with the
similar use interpretation.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1280.02  PURPOSE.
   The use interpretation authority established by this section is intended to
recognize that the provisions of this Code cannot possibly address every
specific use which may occur.  Many such uses, however, can be readily
addressed by an interpretation of this Code in light of the general and
specific purposes for which the Code has been enacted.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1280.03  PARTIES ENTITLED TO SEEK INTERPRETATIONS.
   Application for similar use interpretation may be filed by any person having
an interest in the circumstances giving rise to the need for such an
interpretation; provided, however, that a similar use interpretation shall not
be sought by any person based solely on hypothetical facts or where the
interpretation would have no effect other than as an advisory opinion.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1280.04  PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Application. Applications for similar use interpretations shall be
filed in accordance with the requirements of
Chapter 1276, Applications.
   (b)   Action by Building Commissioner. Upon receipt of a properly completed
application for a similar use interpretation, the Building Commissioner shall
forthwith transmit to the Planning Commission for its review and recommendation
to the Village Council.
   (c)   Recommendation by Planning Commission.  The Planning Commission shall
prepare a written report based on the standards set forth in §
1280.05 and forward its recommendation to the Village Council.
   (d)   Action by Village Council. Upon receipt of the Planning Commission's
recommendation, the Village Council shall make a finding of similar use based
on the standards set forth in §
1280.05.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1280.05  STANDARDS FOR USE INTERPRETATIONS.
   The following standards shall be applied in making a similar use
interpretation:
   (a)   The use is not listed in any other classification of permitted uses.
   (b)   The use does not create dangers to health and safety to an extent
greater than normally resulting from other uses listed in the classification to
which it is to be added.
   (c)   The use does not create traffic to a greater extent than the other
uses listed in the classification to which it is to be added.
   (d)   The use conforms to the intent of both the Comprehensive Master Plan
and this Code.
   (e)   The use is not of any greater intensity, nor would it be likely to
produce greater adverse impacts on adjacent properties, the neighborhood, or
the Village, than the use or uses to which it is interpreted to be similar.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1280.06  EFFECT OF FAVORABLE USE INTERPRETATION.
   No similar use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or
conditionally permitted in a particular district shall authorize the
establishment of such use nor the development, construction, reconstruction,
alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize
the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits and
approvals that may be required by the codes and ordinances of the Village.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
CHAPTER 1282
Conditional Uses
1282.01   Authority.
1282.02   Purpose.
1282.03   Parties entitled to seek conditional use permits.
1282.04   Procedure.
1282.05   General standards for conditional use permits.

1282.07   Conditions on conditional use permits.
1282.08   Affidavit of compliance with conditions.
1282.09   Effect of issuance of a conditional use permit.
1282.10   Limitations on conditional use permits.
1282.11   Amendments to conditional use permits.
1282.01  AUTHORITY.
   The Planning Commission may approve a conditional use if and only if the
conditional use is specifically listed in the applicable zoning district use
regulations as a conditional use. The Planning Commission may grant uses in
accordance with the procedures and standards enumerated in this chapter. The
Commission may approve an application for a conditional use if the proposal
conforms with all applicable laws, ordinances and regulations and is in the
public interest. In determining whether the proposed use is in the public
interest, the Commission has the duty to consider those general factors listed
below in §
1282.05, in addition to any specific standards applicable to the particular use
proposed as found in §
1282.06.  The failure of the proposed work to conform to any single factor or
guideline is not necessarily a sufficient basis for denial. The Commission
shall approve work that maximizes both the public interest and private
benefits.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1282.02  PURPOSE.
   Conditional uses are those uses having some special impact or uniqueness
that requires a careful review of their location, design, configuration, and
special impact to determine, against fixed standards, the desirability of
permitting their establishment on any given site.  They are uses that may or
may not be appropriate in a particular location depending on a weighing, in
each case, of the public need and benefit against the local impact and effect.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1282.03  PARTIES ENTITLED TO SEEK CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   An application for a conditional use permit may be filed by the owner of, or
any person having a legal or equitable interest in, the subject property.

1282.04  PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Application.  Applications for conditional use permits shall be filed
in accordance with the requirements of this
Chapter 1276.
   (b)   Public Hearing.  A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and conducted
by the Planning Commission in accordance with requirements of
Chapter 1278, Public Hearings.
   (c)   Action by Planning Commission.  Within 60 days of receipt of
Application, the Planning Commission will conduct a public hearing, either
granting the application for a conditional use permit; granting the application
subject to conditions; or denying the application.  The failure of the Planning
Commission to act within 60 days, or such further time to which the applicant
may agree, shall be deemed a denial of the application for a conditional use
permit.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1282.05  GENERAL STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   The Commission shall consider the following general standards when
considering a conditional use application:
   (a)   Zoning Code. The proposed work conforms to the underlying zone
district regulations and is in harmony with the general purposes and intent of
the Zoning Code.
   (b)   Plans. The proposed work conforms to the comprehensive master plan to
the greatest extent practicable.
   (c)   Design Guidelines. The proposed work conforms to any design guidelines
adopted or approved by Council that are applicable to the parcel upon which the
proposed work is located.
   (d)   Proposed Zoning Amendments. The proposed work is consistent with any
proposed amendment to the Zoning Code then under consideration by the Planning
Commission or Council.
   (e)   No Undue Adverse Impact.  The proposed use and development will not
have a substantial or undue adverse effect upon adjacent property or the
character of the area.
   (f)   Neighborhood Compatibility. The proposed work is compatible with the
predominant or prevailing land uses of the neighborhood surrounding the
proposed development and will not have a material net cumulative adverse impact
on the neighborhood.
   (g)   Public Benefits. The proposed use will positively impact the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
   (h)   Adequate Public Facilities. The proposed use and development will be
served adequately by essential public facilities and services such as streets,
public utilities, drainage structures, police and fire protection, refuse
disposal, parks, libraries, and schools, or that the applicant will provide
adequately for such services.
   (i)   Economic Benefits. The promotion of the economy of the Village.
   (j)   Job Creation. The creation of jobs both permanently and during
construction.
   (k)   Private Benefits. The economic and other private benefits to the owner

   (l)   No Destruction of Significant Features.  The proposed use and
development will not result in the destruction, loss, or damage of any natural,
scenic, or historic feature of significant importance.
   (m)   Traffic. Streets or other means of access to the proposed use are
suitable and adequate to carry anticipated traffic and will not overload the

uses.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1282.06  SPECIFIC FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED
   In addition to the general standards contained in §
1282.05 for approval of conditional uses, the Planning Commission shall
consider the following factors, where applicable, when such uses require a
conditional use permit pursuant to the applicable zoning district regulations.
No single factor is determinative of the appropriateness of a conditional use,
nor is every factor applicable to every proposed conditional use.
   (a)   Minimum Lot Size. Whether the site upon which the use is located has
adequate area to not only comply with minimum code requirements, but also to
account for additional space needed to take the mitigating measures necessary
to reduce the adverse impacts of the proposed conditional use.
   (b)   Principal Entrance Orientation.  Whether the principal entrance or
entrances are orientated in such a manner so as to reduce adverse impact on the
adjacent properties.
   (c)   Noise from Operations. Whether any equipment, process, or storage
associated with the use shall create odor, noise, vibration, glare, electrical
interference or other adverse impact that effects nearby properties.
   (d)   Noise from Occupants.  Whether other noise associated with the use
from vehicles, customers, employees, and any operations likely to occur on the
premises, will cause nuisances detectable from nearby properties.
   (e)   Peak Activity Periods. Whether the proposed use is of a nature where
it possesses peak activity periods, and whether these periods will be
adequately accommodated on the site without unduly interfering with adjacent
properties.
   (f)   Street Frontage. Whether a lack of street frontage is present that
will exacerbate any of the potentially adverse impacts on the site.
   (g)   Vehicular Access Points - Quantity.  Whether the vehicular access
points are adequate to serve the site.
   (h)   Vehicular Access Points - Quality. Whether the location and quantity
of vehicular access points are located in such a manner so as to reduce adverse
impact on adjacent properties, including an adequate distance from major
intersections.
   (i)   Access to Major Thoroughfares and Arterials. Whether the vehicular
access to the site is appropriately located on a road of adequate capacity to
serve such a use.
   (j)   Interior Site Circulation. Whether the interior vehicular circulation
on the site is adequate to serve the proposed use and reduce impact on adjacent
properties.
   (k)   Emergency Vehicles.  Whether the use will likely bring a greater
frequency of emergency vehicles to the site, and if so, whether the likely or
proposed access points of these vehicles are appropriate and adequate to serve
the site without creating undue adverse impact on adjacent sites by way of
traffic safety or noise issues.
   (l)   Accounting for Drop-off and Pick-up Needs. If any drop-off or pick-up
of individuals is likely to occur, whether the site has adequate area, outside
of the required vehicular circulation, fire lanes, off-street parking, and
loading/delivery areas, to provide an adequate drop-off and pick-up area.
   (m)   Accounting for Vehicle Stacking Needs. Whether the use is likely to
require a greater vehicular stacking area than what is typically required by
the Code, and if so, whether additional stacking area has been provided.
   (n)   Pedestrian Traffic and Use of Site.  Whether pedestrians likely
associated with the proposed use have been adequately and safely accommodated
on the proposed site by way of walkways and lighting.
   (o)   Additional Activities, Programs, Festivals, and Similar Events. 
Whether likely events that may be associated with the use, whether indoor or
outdoor, and whether requiring additional temporary use permits in the future,
are likely to occur in association with such a use, and if so, whether the
applicant has considered and provided for adequate area and facilities to
accommodate these anticipated events.
   (p)   Outdoor Activity Areas. If any outdoor play or activity areas are
associated with the use, whether adjacent properties are adequately buffered
from such areas.
   (q)   Landscaping and Buffering. Whether the applicant has proposed
landscaping, berms, buffer yards, fences, planters in such a manner so as to
promote an attractive site and reduce visual, light, and noise impact on
adjacent uses.
   (r)   Waste Disposal. Whether the use requires additional waste disposal,
such as disposal of bio-waste, chemicals, or other materials, and whether the
site adequately provides sufficient waste containers on the site that comply
with the refuse container requirements of the Code, Fire Code, EPA
requirements, and any other applicable regulations.
   (s)   Pedestrian Refuse. Whether the site includes adequate individual
outdoor waste receptacles to account for outdoor activities on the site.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1282.07  CONDITIONS ON CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   The Planning Commission may impose such conditions and limitations
concerning use, construction, character, location, landscaping, screening, and
other matters relating to the purposes and objectives of this Code upon the
premises benefitted by a conditional use permit as may be necessary or
appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other property and
improvements in the vicinity of the subject property or upon public facilities
and services. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in conditional use
permit, and the Planning Commission may require the unconditional consent of
the applicant to such conditions.  Violation of any such condition or
limitation shall be a violation of this Code and shall constitute grounds for
revocation of the conditional use permit.

1282.09  EFFECT OF ISSUANCE OF A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   The grant of a conditional use permit shall not authorize the establishment

alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize
the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any other permits
or approvals that may be required by the codes and ordinances of the Village,
including but not limited to a Zoning Certificate and building permit.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1282.10  LIMITATIONS ON CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   (a)   Subject to an extension of time granted by the Code, no conditional
use permit shall be valid for a period longer than one year unless a building
permit is issued and construction is actually begun within that period and is
thereafter diligently pursued to completion or unless a Zoning Certificate is
issued and a use commenced within that period.
   (b)   A conditional use permit shall be deemed to authorize only the
particular use for which it was issued, and such permit shall automatically
expire and cease to be of any force or effect if such use shall, for any
reason, be discontinued for a period of six consecutive months or more.
   (c)   Except when otherwise provided in the ordinance granting a conditional
use permit, a conditional use permit shall be deemed to relate to, and be for
the benefit of, the use and the lot in questions rather than the owner or
operator of such use or lot.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13.)
1282.11  AMENDMENTS TO CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.

1284.04  STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.
   An application for appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals properly filed

opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13; Ord. 15-06. Passed 1-20-15.)
1284.05  AUTHORIZED VARIANCES.
   (a)   Permitted Variances. Subject to the prohibitions set forth in this
chapter and proof by the applicant of each of the standards for variances, the
Zoning Board of Appeals may vary the provisions of this Code. The variance
procedures are intended to provide a means by which relief from dimensional,
numerical or locational standards may be granted from a particular application
of the Zoning Code that is unreasonable and creates practical difficulties.
   (b)   Prohibited Variances.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
chapter, no variance shall be granted that:
      (1)   Is intended as a temporary measure only;
      (2)   Is greater than the minimum variance necessary to relieve the
particular hardship or practical difficulty demonstrated by the applicant; or
      (3)   Constitutes a change in land use resulting in the establishment of
a use not normally permitted in the applicable use district.
   (c)   Standards for Variances Other than Sign Variances. The Board shall not
grant a variance as authorized by §
1284.05 unless it can determine that there are practical difficulties
encountered by the applicant in complying with this Zoning Code. The evaluation
shall include, but is not limited to, the following criteria, which need not
all be met in order to grant the requested variance.
      (1)   Whether the property will yield a reasonable return without the
variance or whether there can be beneficial use of the property;
      (2)   Whether the variance is substantial;
      (3)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
      (4)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services;
      (5)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of
the limitations currently imposed on it by this Zoning Code;
      (6)   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance; and
      (7)   Whether the spirit and intent behind this Zoning Code would be
observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance.
   (d)   Standards for Sign Variances. In order that the public welfare may be
guarded and substantial justice done, variances from the sign requirements of
may be recommended for the following reasons:
      (1)   Where the literal application of
Chapter 1262 would result in an unnecessary hardship peculiar to the property
involved and not based on conditions created by the owner.  As used in this
division, “unnecessary hardship” does not include reduction of economic
advantage.
      (2)   Where the granting of a variance will not unduly injure adjoining
or neighboring property.
   (e)   Variance Different or Less Than Requested.  A variance less than or
different from that requested may be granted when the record supports the
applicant's right to some relief but not to the relief requested.
   (f)   Conditions on Variances.  The Zoning Board of Appeals may impose such
specific conditions and limitations concerning use, construction, character,
location, landscaping, screening, and other matters relating to the purposes
and objectives of this Code upon the premises benefitted by a variance as may
be necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other
property and improvements in the vicinity of the subject property.  Such
conditions shall be expressly set forth in the resolution granting the
variance. Violation of any such condition or limitation shall be a violation of
this Code and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the variance.
   (g)   Compliance with Conditions.  Whenever any variance authorized pursuant
to this section is made subject to conditions and limitations to be met by the
applicant, the applicant shall upon meeting such conditions notify the Building
Commissioner for inspection of compliance.
   (h)   Effect of Grant of Variance. The grant of a variance shall not
authorize the establishment or extension of any use nor the development,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or
structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing
of applications for any permits and approval that may be required by the codes
and ordinances of the Village including, but not limited to, a building permit,
a certificate of zoning compliance, and site plan approval.
   (i)   Time Limitations on Variances. Subject to an extension of time granted
by the Building Commissioner, no variance from the provisions of this Code
shall be valid for a period longer than one year unless a building permit is
issued and construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter
diligently pursued to completion or unless a Zoning Certificate is issued and a
use in conformance with the variance requested is commenced within that period.
(Ord. 12-64. Passed 3-12-13; Ord. 15-06. Passed 1-20-15.)

or the Mayor disagrees with the determination made by the Board, an appeal may
be made to the Council. The following rules apply:

modify, vacate or reverse the decision of the Board, it may only do so through
a concurring vote of at least five members of Council. If at least five members
do not concur, the decision of the Board will be upheld without change.
   (e)   Notice of Decision. Upon the approval by the Council, the Village
Clerk will post the resolution for the period specified for all ordinances, and
send it to all interested parties, including the Secretary of the Board, who

1464.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS OF FACT; PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES.
   (a)   Statutory authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens.  Therefore, the Council of the Village of Evendale, State of Ohio,
does ordain this chapter.
   (b)   Findings of fact.  The Village of Evendale has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base.  Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss.  In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, this chapter is
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of purpose.  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote
the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designated to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of reducing flood loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

1464.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter the most reasonable application.
   "Accessory structure" means a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   "Appeal" means a request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
   "Base flood" means the flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year. The “base flood” may also be referred to as the “1% chance
annual flood” or “100-year flood.”
   "Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)" means the water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL).  In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from one
to three feet).
   "Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   "Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   "Enclosure below the lowest floor." See “Lowest floor.”
   "Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)" is the order issued by
President Carter in 1977. This order requires that no federally assisted
activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special
flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   "Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)" means the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   "Fill" means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   "Flood" or "Flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   "Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)," usually the initial map, produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
   "Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means an official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   "Flood insurance risk zones" means zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community. 
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   "Flood Insurance Study (FIS)" means the official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   "Flood Protection Elevation" means the Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood floodway elevation plus one foot of freeboard.  In areas
where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood
protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge.  A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height.  In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.  The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and
is usually characterized by any of the following:  Moderate to high velocity
flood waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to
high erosion forces.
   "Freeboard" is a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management.  Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   "Historic structure" means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the Village of Evendale whose historic preservation program has been
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   "Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis" means an analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   "Letter of Map Change (LOMC)" means a Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. 
LOMC’s are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   "Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)" means a revision based on
technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated
special flood hazard area.  A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance
Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special
flood hazard area.
      (2)   "Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)" means a revision based on technical
data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. 
One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   "Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)" means a formal review
and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria.  A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure.  This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in this chapter for enclosures below
the lowest floor.
   “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a “manufactured home” includes manufactured
homes and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   “Manufactured home park.” As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code 3701-
27-01, means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes used
for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and
includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is
subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale
or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is
not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   "National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)" is a Federal program enabling
property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance protection
against losses from flooding.  This insurance is designed to provide an
insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods. 
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   "New construction" means structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Evendale
Flood Insurance Rate Map, September 29, 1986, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   "Person" includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies.  An agency is further defined in Ohio R.C. 111.15 as
any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district, or state community college.  “Agency” does not include the general
assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s department, or any
court.
   "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is built on a single chassis,
400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection,
designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and
designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living
quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   "Registered professional architect" means a person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   "Registered professional engineer" means a person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   "Registered professional surveyor" means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   "Special flood hazard area," also known as "areas of special flood hazard",
it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of
flooding in any given year.  Special flood hazard areas are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99.  Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   "Start of construction" means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date.  The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation.  Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.  For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   "Substantial damage" is damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement.  This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. 
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   "Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with this chapter.

management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available.  These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;

Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)
hereof.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details.  Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of Village of
Evendale, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of Evendale have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Village of Evendale’s Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the Village
of Evendale boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
Village of Evendale suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the Village of Evendale has assumed
or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data use and flood map interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations.  Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
this chapter.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA.  Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard.  A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1464.06.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial damage determinations.
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.  After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process.  These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

      (3)   They shall be constructed and placed on the lot to offer the
minimum resistance to the flow of flood waters;
      (4)   They shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation;
      (5)   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall
be elevated or floodproofed to or above the level of the flood protection
elevation; and
      (6)   They shall meet the opening requirements of subsection (d)(5)C.
hereof;
   (g)   Recreational vehicles.  Recreational vehicles must meet at least one
of the following standards:
      (1)   They shall not be located on sites in special flood hazard areas
for more than 180 days, or
      (2)   They must be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
      (3)   They must meet all standards of subsection (d) hereof.
   (h)   Above ground gas or liquid storage tanks.  All above ground gas or
liquid storage tanks shall be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral movement
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads.
   (i)   Assurance of flood carrying capacity.  Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in this chapter, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.  Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1464.04(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas which
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of Village of Evendale and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point.    Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1) hereof.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse.  For the purpose of this chapter, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.  The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites:  An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique
or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished.  Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished.  The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Village of Evendale specifying the maintenance responsibilities.  If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1464.04(j) when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

1464.06  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board established.
      (1)   The Mayor with concurrence of the Village Council of the Village of
Evendale shall appoint an Appeals Board consisting seven members consisting of
the Fire Chief, a member of Council, and either Residents or Business
Representatives.  The members shall serve three-year terms after which time
they shall be reappointed or replaced by the Mayor with concurrence of the
Village Council of the Village of Evendale.  Each member shall serve until his
or her successor is appointed.
      (2)   A chairperson shall be appointed by the Mayor with concurrence of
the Village Council of the Village of Evendale.  Meetings of the Appeals Board
shall be held as needed and shall be held at the call of the Chairperson, or in
his or her absence, the Acting Chairperson.  All meetings of the Appeals Board
shall be open to the public except that the Board may deliberate in executive
sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in accordance with law.  The
Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each
member upon each question and shall keep records of all official actions. 
Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in The Village of Evendale
Building Department, 10500 Reading Road, Evendale, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of this
chapter.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within thirty days of the date of such notice and order, or other
official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the
mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator’s
decision.  Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be
filed with the Floodplain Administrator.  Upon receipt of the appeal, the
Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent
information on which the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made to the
Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance.  The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of this
chapter, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to
the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a
literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Notice for public hearing.  The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty days after the receipt of an application
for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator.  Prior to the hearing, a
notice of such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of general
circulation in the community at least ten days before the date of the hearing.
      (3)   Public hearing.
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence, as the Appeals Board requires.  In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
this chapter and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property.  Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of this
chapter does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of this
chapter, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A.1. to 11.
hereof have been fully considered.  As the lot size increases beyond one-half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses.  A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance
and service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision.  The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.

applicant requests an extension of time in writing in order to make amendments,
the Village Engineer shall endorse thereon his or her approval or disapproval
and forward the same to the Clerk of Council, together with all other
information that will assist Council in making the final decision. Council may
hold a public hearing on the submitted plan if it deems the same appropriate
and useful. A copy of the plan shall remain on file in the Clerk's office at
all times until acted on by Council, which action shall be not less than 30 or
more than 60 days after receipt of the plan from the Engineer. Council shall
either approve, disapprove, or return the plan to the applicant for revision
and amendment. The decision of Council shall be final, subject only to review
by the courts. If Council approves a plan, such approval shall be conditioned
upon, and not take effect until, the performance bond specified in such
approval by Council shall have been filed with the Building Commissioner.
Copies of an approved plan shall be filed with the Clerk, the Engineer, the
Building Commissioner, the Planning Commission and the County Soil and Water
Conservation District.

1466.06  RECOMMENDED MEASURES TO MINIMIZE EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION.
   The following measures are declared to be effective in minimizing erosion
and sedimentation and shall be included where applicable in the control plan:
   (a)   Stripping of vegetation, regrading, or other development shall be done
in such a way as to minimize erosion;
   (b)   Development plans shall preserve salient natural features, keep cut-
fill operations to a minimum and ensure conformity with topography so as to
create the least erosion potential and adequately handle the volume of velocity
of surface water runoff.
   (c)   Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected,
and supplemented;
   (d)   The disturbed area and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a
practical minimum;
