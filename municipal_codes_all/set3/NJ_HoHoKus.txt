General Program Purposes, Procedures
§ 2-1. Affordable housing obligation.
A. This section of the Borough Code sets forth regulations regarding the
low- and moderate-income housing units in the Borough consistent with
the provisions known as the "Substantive Rules of the New Jersey
Council on Affordable Housing," N.J.A.C. 5:93 et seq.;1 the Uniform
Housing Affordability Controls (UHAC), N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.1 et seq.,
except where modified by the terms of a settlement agreement between
the Borough and Fair Share Housing Center (FSHC) such that the
statutory requirement to provide very-low-income units equal to 13% of
affordable units approved and constructed after July 1, 2008, to be
affordable to households at 30% of the regional median income,
overrides the UHAC requirement that 10% of all low- and moderateincome
units must be affordable at 35% of the regional median income,
and the Borough's constitutional obligation to provide a fair share of
affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households. In
addition, this section applies requirements for very-low-income housing
as established in P.L. 2008, c. 46 (the "Roberts Bill," codified at N.J.S.A.
52:27D-329.1). [Amended 3-27-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-04]
B. This chapter is intended to assure that very-low-, low- and moderateincome
units ("affordable units") are created with controls on
affordability over time and that very-low-, low- and moderate-income
households shall occupy these units. This chapter shall apply to all
inclusionary developments and one-hundred-percent affordable
developments (including those funded with low-income housing tax
credit financing) except where inconsistent with applicable law.
[Amended 3-27-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-04]
C. The Ho-Ho-Kus Borough Planning Board has adopted a Housing
Element and Fair Share Plan pursuant to the Municipal Land Use Law
at N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq. The plan has also been endorsed by the
Borough Council of the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus. The Fair Share Plan
describes the ways the Borough shall address its fair share for low- and
moderate-income housing as determined by the Superior Court and
documented in the Housing Element.
D. This chapter implements and incorporates the Fair Share Plan and
addresses the requirements of N.J.A.C. 5:93, as may be amended and
supplemented.
E. The Borough shall file monitoring and status reports with the Superior
Court and place the reports on its municipal website. Any plan
evaluation report of the Housing Element and Fair Share Plan and
monitoring evaluation report prepared by the Special Master in
accordance with N.J.A.C. 5:912 shall be available to the public at the Ho-

Ho-Kus Borough Municipal Building, 333 Warren Avenue, Ho-Ho-Kus,
New Jersey 07423.
F. On or about January 12 of each year through the end of the period of
Third Round Judgment of Repose, the Borough will provide annual
reporting of the status of all affordable housing activity within the
municipality through posting on the municipal website with a copy of
such posting provided to all parties to the Borough's Court-approved
settlement agreements, using forms previously developed for this
purpose by the Council on Affordable Housing or any other forms
endorsed by the Special Master and Fair Share Housing Center (FSHC).
[Added 3-27-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-04]
G. The Fair Housing Act includes two provisions regarding action to be
taken by the Borough during the ten-year period of protection provided
in the Borough's agreement with FSHC. The Borough agrees to comply
with those provisions as follows:
(1) By July 1, 2020, the Borough must prepare a midpoint realistic
opportunity review, as required pursuant to N.J.S.A. 52:27D-313,
which the Borough will post on its municipal website, with a copy
provided to FSHC and the Intervenors, a status report as to its
implementation of its plan and an analysis of whether any unbuilt
sites or unfulfilled mechanisms continue to present a realistic
opportunity. Such posting shall invite any interested party to
submit comments to the municipality, with a copy to FSHC and the
Intervenors, regarding whether any sites no longer present a
realistic opportunity and should be replaced and whether any
mechanisms to meet unmet need should be revised or
supplemented. Any interested party may by motion request a
hearing before the Court regarding these issues. In the event the
Court determines that a site or mechanism no longer presents a
realistic opportunity and should be replaced or supplemented, then
the municipality shall have the opportunity to supplement or revise
its plan to correct any deficiency.
(2) Within 30 days of January 12, 2020 and January 12, 2023 the
Borough shall prepare a review of compliance with the very-lowincome
housing requirements required by N.J.S.A. 52:27D-329.1
and its settlement agreement with Fair Share Housing Center. The
Borough will post on its municipal website, with a copy provided to
FSHC and the Intervenors, a status report as to its satisfaction of
its very-low-income requirements, including the family very-lowincome
requirements referenced herein and in the Borough's
settlement agreement with FSHC. Such posting shall invite any
interested party to submit comments to the municipality and FSHC
and the Intervenors on the issue of whether the municipality has
complied with its very-low-income housing obligation.

§ 2-2 HO-HO-KUS CODE § 2-3
1:14
rezoning or Zoning Board action, use or density variance,
redevelopment plan, or rehabilitation plan that provides for densities
at or above six units per acre is required to include an affordable
housing set-aside of 20% if the affordable units will be for sale and
15% if the affordable units will be for rent. This requirement does not
give any developer the right to any such rezoning, variance or other
relief or establish any obligation on the part of Ho-Ho-Kus to grant such
rezoning, variance or other relief. No subdivision shall be permitted or

B. This Borough-wide mandatory set-aside requirement does not

C. Fractional units. [Added 3-27-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-04]
(1) In the event that the inclusionary set-aside percentage (15% or
20%) of the total number of residential units does not result in a full
integer, the developer may choose one of two options of addressing
the fractional unit:
(a) The developer shall round the set-aside upward to construct a
whole additional affordable unit; or
(b) If the set-aside includes a fractional unit equal to 0.49 or less,
the developer may round the set-aside downward and
construct the lesser whole number of affordable units but must
also make a payment in lieu of constructing the fractional
additional unit ("fractional payment in lieu").
[1] The fractional payment in lieu amount shall be calculated
as the fractional unit multiplied by the base payment in
lieu dollar amount established in § 2-4C(1) of the Borough
Code.
(2) For example, if seven total units are developed at an inclusionary
site, a set-aside of 20% would require 1.4 affordable units. Per the
requirements above:
(a) The developer shall round up the 0.4 unit to one whole
affordable unit so as to construct a total of two affordable
housing units, in accordance with § 2-3C(1)(a); or
(b) In accordance with § 2-3C(1)(b), the developer shall round the
set-aside downward so as to construct only affordable unit and
shall pay into the Borough's Affordable Housing Trust Fund a
fractional in-lieu payment equal to the dollar amount
established in § 2-4C(1) multiplied by 0.4 unit.
§ 2-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 2-4
1:15
§ 2-4. New construction.
The following requirements shall apply to all new or planned developments
that contain low- and moderate-income housing units:
A. Phasing. Final site plan or subdivision approval shall be contingent
upon the affordable housing development meeting the following
phasing schedule for low- and moderate-income units, whether
developed in a single-phase development or in a multiphase

accessible entrance shall be installed.
[2] To this end, the builder of restricted units shall deposit
funds within the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus's Affordable

the purchase price and the Federal Reserve H.15 rate of interest),
taxes, homeowner and private mortgage insurance and
condominium or homeowners' association fees do not exceed 28%

5:80-26.3, as may be amended and supplemented.
(9) The price of owner-occupied low- and moderate-income units may
increase annually based on the percentage increase in the regional
median income limit for each housing region. In no event shall the
maximum resale price established by the administrative agent be
lower than the last recorded purchase price. Income limits for all
units for which income limits are not already established through a
federal program exempted from the Uniform Housing Affordability
Controls pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.1 shall be updated by the
Borough annually within 30 days of the publication of
determinations of median income by HUD as follows: [Amended
3-27-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-04]
(a) Regional income limits shall be established for Region 1 based
on the median income by household size, which shall be
established by a regional weighted average of the uncapped
Section 8 income limits published by HUD. To compute this
regional income limit, the HUD determination of median
county income for a family of four is multiplied by the
estimated households within the county according to the most
§ 2-4 HO-HO-KUS CODE § 2-4
1:20
§ 2-5. Condominium and homeowners' association fees.
For any affordable housing unit that is part of a condominium association
and/or homeowners' association, the master deed shall reflect that the
recent decennial census. The resulting product for each county
within the housing region is summed. The sum is divided by
the estimated total households from the most recent decennial
census in Region 1. This quotient represents the regional
weighted average of median income for a household of four.
The income limit for a moderate-income unit for a household
of four shall be 80% of the regional weighted average median
income for a family of four. The income limit for a low-income
unit for a household of four shall be 50% of the HUD
determination of the regional weighted average median
income for a family of four. The income limit for a very-lowincome
unit for a household of four shall be 30% of the regional
weighted average median income for a family of four. These
income limits shall be adjusted by household size based on
multipliers used by HUD to adjust median income by
household size. In no event shall the income limits be less than
those for the previous year.
(b) The income limits calculated each year shall be the result of
applying the percentages set forth in Subsection G(9)(a) above
to HUD's determination of median income for the relevant
fiscal year and shall be utilized until the Borough updates the
income limits after HUD has published revised determinations
of median income for the next fiscal year.
(c) The regional asset limit used in determining an applicant's
eligibility for affordable housing pursuant to N.J.A.C.
5:80-26.16(b)3 shall be calculated by the Borough annually by
taking the percentage increase of the income limits calculated
pursuant to Subsection G(9)(a) above over the previous year's
income limits and applying the same percentage increase to
the regional asset limit from the prior year. In no event shall
the regional asset limit be less than that for the previous year.
(10) The rent levels of very-low-, low- and moderate-income units may
be increased annually based on the percentage increase in the
Housing Consumer Price Index for the Northeast Urban Area, upon
its publication for the prior calendar year. This increase shall not
exceed 9% in any one year. Rents for units constructed pursuant to
low-income housing tax credit regulations shall be indexed
pursuant to the regulations governing low-income housing tax
credits. [Amended 3-27-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-04]
(11) Tenant-paid utilities that are included in the utility allowance shall
be so stated in the lease and shall be consistent with the utility
allowance approved by DCA for its Section 8 program.

(a) A fine of not more than $500 or imprisonment for a period not
to exceed 90 days, or both. Each and every day that the
violation continues or exists shall be considered a separate and
specific violation of these provisions and not as a continuing
offense.
(b) In the case of an owner who has rented his or her low- or
moderate-income unit in violation of the regulations governing
affordable housing units, payment into the Borough of Ho-Ho-
Kus Affordable Housing Trust Fund of the gross amount of rent
illegally collected.
(c) In the case of an owner who has rented his or her low- or
moderate-income unit in violation of the regulations governing
affordable housing units, payment of an innocent tenant's
reasonable relocation costs, as determined by the Court.
(2) The municipality may file a Court action in the Superior Court
seeking a judgment, which would result in the termination of the
owner's equity or other interest in the unit, in the nature of a
mortgage foreclosure. Any judgment shall be enforceable as if the
same were a judgment of default of the first purchase money
mortgage and shall constitute a lien against the low- and moderateincome
unit.
C. Such judgment shall be enforceable, at the option of the municipality,
by means of an execution sale by the Sheriff, at which time the low- and
moderate-income unit of the violating owner shall be sold at a sale price
which is not less than the amount necessary to fully satisfy and pay off
any first purchase money mortgage and prior liens and the costs of the
enforcement proceedings incurred by the municipality, including
attorney's fees. The violating owner shall have the right to possession
terminated as well as the title conveyed pursuant to the Sheriff's sale.
D. The proceeds of the Sheriff's sale shall first be applied to satisfy the first
purchase money mortgage lien and any prior liens upon the low- and
moderate-income unit. The excess, if any, shall be applied to reimburse
the municipality for any and all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with either the Court action resulting in the judgment of
violation or the Sheriff's sale. In the event that the proceeds from the
Sheriff's sale are insufficient to reimburse the municipality in full as
§ 2-27 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 2-27
1:31
aforesaid, the violating owner shall be personally responsible for and to
the extent of such deficiency, in addition to any and all costs incurred
by the municipality in connection with collecting such deficiency. In
the event that a surplus remains after satisfying all of the above, such
surplus, if any, shall be placed in escrow by the municipality for the
owner and shall be held in such escrow for a maximum period of two
years or until such earlier time as the owner shall make a claim with the
municipality for such. Failure of the owner to claim such balance within
the two-year period shall automatically result in a forfeiture of such
balance to the municipality. Any interest accrued or earned on such
balance while being held in escrow shall belong to and shall be paid to
the municipality, whether such balance shall be paid to the owner or
forfeited to the municipality.
E. Foreclosure by the municipality due to violation of the regulations
governing affordable housing units shall not extinguish the restrictions
of the regulations governing affordable housing units as the same apply
to the low- and moderate-income unit. Title shall be conveyed to the
purchaser at the Sheriff's sale, subject to the restrictions and provisions
of the regulations governing the affordable housing unit. The owner
determined to be in violation of the provisions of this plan and from
whom title and possession were taken by means of the Sheriff's sale
shall not be entitled to any right of redemption.
F. If there are no bidders at the Sheriff's sale, or if insufficient amounts
are bid to satisfy the first purchase money mortgage and any prior liens,
the municipality may acquire title to the low- and moderate-income unit
by satisfying the first purchase money mortgage and any prior liens and
crediting the violating owner with an amount equal to the difference
between the first purchase money mortgage and any prior liens and
costs of the enforcement proceedings, including legal fees and the
maximum resale price for which the low- and moderate-income unit
could have been sold under the terms of the regulations governing
affordable housing units. This excess shall be treated in the same
manner as the excess which would have been realized from an actual
sale as previously described.
G. Failure of the low- and moderate-income unit to be either sold at the
Sheriff's sale or acquired by the municipality shall obligate the owner to
accept an offer to purchase from any qualified purchaser which may be
referred to the owner by the municipality, with such offer to purchase
being equal to the maximum resale price of the low- and moderateincome
unit as permitted by the regulations governing affordable
housing units.
H. The owner shall remain fully obligated, responsible and liable for
complying with the terms and restrictions of governing affordable
housing units until such time as title is conveyed from the owner.

§ 17-2. Basic requirements. [Amended 3-27-2018 by Ord. No.
2018-02]
A. In Holmdel Builder's Association v. Holmdel Township, 121 N.J. 550
(1990), the New Jersey Supreme Court determined that mandatory
development fees are authorized by the Fair Housing Act of 1985 (the
Act), N.J.S.A. 52:27d-301 et seq., and the State Constitution, subject to
the Council on Affordable Housing's (COAH's) adoption of rules.
B. COAH was authorized by P.L. 2008, c. 46, Section 8 (N.J.S.A.
52:27D-329.2), and the Statewide Nonresidential Development Fee Act
(N.J.S.A. 40:55D-8.1 through 40:55D-8.7) to adopt and promulgate
regulations necessary for the establishment, implementation, review,
monitoring and enforcement of municipal Affordable Housing Trust
Funds and corresponding spending plans. Municipalities that are under
the jurisdiction of COAH or a court of competent jurisdiction and have a
COAH or Court-approved spending plan may retain fees collected from
nonresidential development. [Amended 3-27-2018 by Ord. No.
2018-02]
C. In re: adoption of N.J.A.C. 5:96 and 5:9726 by the New Jersey Council on
Affordable Housing, 221 N.J. 1 (2015), also known as the Mount Laurel
IV decision, the Supreme Court remanded COAH's duties to the
Superior Court. As a result, affordable housing development fee
collections and expenditures from the municipal Affordable Housing
Trust Funds to implement municipal Third Round Fair Share Plans
through July 1, 2025, are under the Court's jurisdiction and are subject
to approval by the Court. [Added 3-27-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-0227]
D. This chapter establishes standards for the collection, maintenance, and
expenditure of development fees pursuant to COAH's regulations and in
accordance with P.L. 2008, c. 46, Sections 8 and 32 through 38.28 Fees
collected pursuant to this chapter shall be used for the sole purpose of
providing low- and moderate-income housing. This chapter shall be
interpreted within the framework of COAH's rules on development fees,
codified at N.J.A.C. 5:93-8.29 [Amended 3-27-2018 by Ord. No.
2018-02]
A. This chapter became effective when COAH approved the Borough's
development fee ordinance and remains effective pursuant to the
Superior Court's jurisdiction in accordance with N.J.A.C. 5:93-8.
B. COAH approved the Borough's initial Spending Plan on July 7, 1998.
Subsequently, in an Order of December 18, 2017, the Superior Court
conditionally approved the Borough's Amended Third Round Spending

(1) Within the R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4 and R-5 Zoning Districts, residential
developers, except for developers of the types of development
specifically exempted below, shall pay a fee of 1.5% of the equalized
assessed value for residential development, provided no increased

§ 17-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17-4
1:109
§ 17-5. Nonresidential development fees.
developers may be required to pay a development fee of 6% of
the equalized assessed value for each additional unit that may be
realized. However, if the zoning on a site has changed during the
two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance application,
the base density for the purposes of calculating the bonus
development fee shall be the highest density permitted by right
during the two-year period preceding the filing of the variance
application. Example: If an approval allows four units to be
constructed on a site that was zoned for two units, the fees could
equal 1.5% of the equalized assessed value on the first two units;
and the specified higher percentage up to six percent of the
equalized assessed value for the two additional units, provided
zoning on the site has not changed during the two-year period
preceding the filing of such a variance application.
B. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for residential
development.
(1) Affordable housing developments, developments where the
developer is providing for the construction of affordable units
elsewhere in the municipality, and developments where the
developer has made a payment in lieu of on-site construction of
affordable units shall be exempt from development fees.
(2) Developments that have received preliminary or final site plan
approval prior to the adoption of a municipal development fee
ordinance shall be exempt from development fees, unless the
developer seeks a substantial change in the approval. Where a site
plan approval does not apply, a zoning and/or building permit shall
be synonymous with preliminary or final site plan approval for this
purpose. The fee percentage shall be vested on the date that the
building permit is issued.
(3) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing
structure undergoes a change to a more intense use, is demolished
and replaced, or is expanded, if the expansion is not otherwise
exempt from the development fee requirement. The development
fee shall be calculated on the increase in the equalized assessed
value of the improved structure.
(4) Developers of one or two owner-occupied dwelling units,
residential structures demolished and replaced as a result of a
natural disaster, green buildings, etc., shall be exempt from paying
a development fee.
A. Imposed fees.
(1) Within all zoning districts, nonresidential developers, except for
developers of the types of development specifically exempted, shall
§ 17-4 HO-HO-KUS CODE § 17-5
1:110
pay a fee equal to 2.5% of the equalized assessed value of the land
and improvements for all new nonresidential construction on an
unimproved lot or lots.
(2) Nonresidential developers, except for developers of the types of
development specifically exempted, shall also pay a fee equal to
2.5% of the increase in equalized assessed value resulting from any
additions to existing structures to be used for nonresidential
purposes.
(3) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing
structure is demolished and replaced. The development fee of 2.5%
shall be calculated on the difference between the equalized
assessed value of the preexisting land and improvement and the
equalized assessed value of the newly improved structure, i.e., land
and improvement, at the time final certificate of occupancy is
issued. If the calculation required under this section results in a
negative number, the nonresidential development fee shall be zero.
B. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for
nonresidential development.
(1) The nonresidential portion of a mixed-use inclusionary or market
rate development shall be subject to the two-and-one-half-percent
development fee, unless otherwise exempted below.
(2) The two-and-one-half-percent fee shall not apply to an increase in
equalized assessed value resulting from alterations, change in use
within existing footprint, reconstruction, renovations and repairs.
(3) Nonresidential developments shall be exempt from the payment of
nonresidential development fees in accordance with the
exemptions required pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46, as specified in the
Form N-RDF, "State of New Jersey Nonresidential Development
Certification/Exemption" form. Any exemption claimed by a
developer shall be substantiated by that developer.
(4) A developer of a nonresidential development exempted from the
nonresidential development fee pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46, shall
be subject to it at such time the basis for the exemption no longer
applies and shall make the payment of the nonresidential
development fee, in that event, within three years after that event
or after the issuance of the final certificate of occupancy of the
nonresidential development, whichever is later.
(5) If a property which was exempted from the collection of a
nonresidential development fee thereafter ceases to be exempt
from property taxation, the owner of the property shall remit the
fees required pursuant to this section within 45 days of the
termination of the property tax exemption. Unpaid nonresidential
development fees under these circumstances may be enforceable
by Ho-Ho-Kus as a lien against the real property of the owner.
§ 17-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17-6
1:111
§ 17-6. Collection procedures.
A. Upon the granting of a preliminary, final or other applicable approval
for a development, the applicable approving authority shall direct its
staff to notify the Construction Official responsible for the issuance of a
building permit.

inspection, the Municipal Assessor shall confirm or modify the
previously estimated equalized assessed value of the improvements of
the development; calculate the development fee; and thereafter notify
the developer of the amount of the fee.
G. Should Ho-Ho-Kus fail to determine or notify the developer of the
amount of the development fee within 10 business days of the request
for final inspection, the developer may estimate the amount due and
pay that estimated amount consistent with the dispute process set forth
in Subsection b of Section 37 of P.L. 2008, c. 46 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-8.6).
H. Fifty percent of the development fee shall be collected at the time of
issuance of the building permit. The remaining portion shall be

E. Violations and penalties. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 26-8E of
the Code of the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus, any person or corporation,
including an officer, director or employee of a corporation, who or
which violates any of the provisions of this § 26-9 shall commit a
violation of the Uniform Fire Safety Act of New Jersey40 and shall be
subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 for a first offense and for each
and every subsequent and separate offense which shall be enforceable
by civil action in a summary manner under the Penalty Enforcement
Law, N.J.S.A. 2A:58-1 et seq.,41 with further provisions that a violator
who fails to pay may be imprisoned for up to six months. In case of
continuing violations, each day that the violation persists shall be
deemed a separate violation. In addition, the violator shall become
liable to the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus for the cost of suppressing any fire
directly or indirectly resulting from the violation pursuant to the
provisions of N.J.S.A. 52:27D-210.
A. The flood hazard areas of the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities
and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected
from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.

foot to three feet, a clearly defined channel does not exist, the path of
flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and velocity flow may be
evident.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  The land in the floodplain
within a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of
flooding in any given year.
BASE FLOOD  The flood having a one-percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.

ELEVATED BUILDING  A nonbasement building built, in the case of
a building in an area of special flood hazard, to have the top of the
elevated floor or, in the case of a building in a coastal high-hazard
area, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member
of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of
piling, columns (posts and piers) or shear walls parallel to the flow of
the water and adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural
integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of
the base flood. In an area of special flood hazard, "elevated building"
also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation
perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movement of floodwaters. In areas of coastal high hazard, "elevated
building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of

violation of other applicable nonelevation design requirements.
NEW CONSTRUCTION  Structures for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the effective date of this chapter.
START OF CONSTRUCTION  For other than new construction or
substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act

the building permit was issued, provided that the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement
was within 180 days of the permit date. The "actual start" means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure
on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footing, the installation of
piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of
excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of
streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement,
footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor
does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part

8-23-2005 by Ord. No. 901]
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any repair, reconstruction or
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50%
of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or
repair is started or, if the structure has been damaged and is being
restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this
definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of
the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however,
include either:[Amended 9-19-1995 by Ord. No. 750]
VARIANCE  A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter
which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be
prohibited by this chapter.
Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which
are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
(1)
Any alteration of an historic structure, provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structures continued designation as an
historic structure.

size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, provided that Subsection D(1)
§ 27-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 27-19
1:167
§ 27-20. Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
through (11) in § 27-18 have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases. [Amended 9-19-1995 by Ord. No.
750]
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as
an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure. [Amended
9-19-1995 by Ord. No. 750]
C. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
D. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause.
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant.
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense or create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public as identified in § 27-18 or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
F. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
A. General standards. In all areas of special flood hazard, the following
standards are required:
(1) Anchoring. All new construction and substantial improvements
shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement
of the structure.
(2) Construction materials and methods.
(a) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to
flood damage.
§ 27-19 HO-HO-KUS CODE § 27-20
1:168
(b) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood
damage.
(3) Utilities.
(a) All new and replacement water supply systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the system.
(b) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems and discharge from the systems into
floodwaters.
(c) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during
flooding.
(d) Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air-conditioning
equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components during conditions of flooding. [Added
2-27-1990 by Ord. No. 652]
(4) Subdivision proposals. [Amended 4-28-1987 by Ord. No. 603]
(a) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.
(b) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems,
located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
(c) All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage
provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
(d) Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development which contain at
least 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less.
(e) For all new construction and substantial improvements, fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to
flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the
entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
[1] A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed
area subject to flooding shall be provided.
§ 27-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 27-20
1:169
[2] The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
[3] Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers or other
coverings or devices, provided that they permit the
automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
B. Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood
elevation data have been provided as set forth in § 27-6, Basis for
establishing areas of special flood hazard, or in § 27-14, Use of other
base flood data, the following standards are required:
(1) Residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest
floor, including basement, elevated to or above base flood
elevation.
(2) Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential
structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to the level of the base flood elevation, together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities, or shall: [Amended
4-28-1987 by Ord. No. 603]
(a) Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure
is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water.
(b) Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
(c) Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance
with accepted standards of practice for meeting the applicable
provisions of this subsection. Such certification shall be
provided to the official as set forth in § 27-15B.
C. Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§ 27-6 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an
extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry
debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following
provisions apply:
(1) Encroachments shall be prohibited, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements and other development
unless a technical evaluation demonstrates that encroachments
shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence
of the base flood discharge.
(2) If § 27-20C(1) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
§ 27-20 HO-HO-KUS CODE § 27-20

Adjustment; except, however, that the running of the period of
limitation herein provided shall be tolled from the date of filing an

body or to a court of competent jurisdiction until the termination or
conclusion in any manner of such appeal or proceeding; and also

subdivision or site plan approval, the variance shall extend for the full
period of preliminary approval.
B. Upon a showing of good cause and if the reason(s) for the grant of a
variance have not changed, the Zoning Board of Adjustment is
authorized to, upon notice to all entitled property owners and the
publication of a legal notice in the official newspaper of the Borough,
grant an extension of time on the duration of the variance for a period
to be determined by the Board of Adjustment but not to extend beyond

upon which such Board is authorized by Chapter 85, Zoning, to
pass.
(3) Where, by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape
of a specific piece of property, or by reason of exceptional
topographic conditions, or by reason of other extraordinary and
exceptional situation or condition of such piece of property, the
strict application of any regulation in Chapter 85, Zoning, would
result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to or
exceptional and undue hardship upon the owner of such property,
grant, upon an application or an appeal relating to such property, a
variance from such strict application so as to relieve such
difficulties or hardship; provided, however, that no variance shall
be granted under this subsection to allow a structure or use in a
district restricted against such structure or use, and further
provided that the proposed development does not require approval

permitted floor area ratio as defined in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-4, except as
applied to the required lot area for a lot or lots for detached one- or
two-dwelling-unit buildings, which lot or lots are either an isolated

variance granted under this subsection shall be granted only by
affirmative vote of at least five members of the Board. [Amended

(5) Where an application or appeal relating to a specific piece of
property seeks a variance from any regulation adopted pursuant to
Article 8 of the Municipal Land Use Law, including without
limitation a variance from the requirements of Chapter 85, Zoning,
the purposes of the Municipal Land Use Law would be advanced by
a deviation from the requirements of Chapter 85, Zoning, and the
benefits of the deviation would substantially outweigh any
detriment, grant such a variance; provided, however, that no
variance from those departures enumerated in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d
shall be granted under this subsection. [Added 8-28-1990 by
Ord. No. 661]

1:281
the trees and shrubs to be planted. It shall also indicate what
protection or devices will be used to preserve existing trees
during construction and the method of accomplishing grade
changes at existing trees.
(b) Portions of all front, rear and side yards which are not used for

(d) Prior to any preliminary and/or final site plan approval, the
Board shall have received a report from the Shade Tree
Commission as to the adequacy of the landscape plan.
(e) The Mayor and Council of the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus finds that
lack of street trees is causing increased drainage problems,
soil erosion and sedimentation, decreased fertility of the soil,
degradation of water resources, decreased groundwater
recharge, increased buildup of atmospheric carbon dioxide,
the establishment of a heat island effects and increased dust
and pollution. All of the above can negatively affect the value of
the properties in Ho-Ho-Kus and overall quality of life.
Therefore, the Mayor and Council of the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus
finds that a street tree planting deposit is needed to ensure the
health, safety and welfare of its residents and to maintain a
high quality of life in the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus. [Added
5-26-2015 by Ord. No. 1039; amended 12-22-2015 by
Ord. No. 1045]
[1] Streets trees and plantings within the right-of-way of the
Borough, including Borough-owned parks and buildings,
are under the jurisdiction of the Shade Tree Commission.
The street planting deposit shall apply to any new house
constructed on a vacant parcel or on a lot where an
existing residence is demolished or the additional floor
area is increased by 25% as determined by the
§ 32B-10 HO-HO-KUS CODE § 32B-10
1:282
Construction Code Official and to all commercial
properties. The Shade Tree Commission shall inspect the
affected property and make a determination on the
requirement of a street tree planting deposit before a
building permit is issued. The Shade Tree Commission
shall be notified before a demolition permit is issued. Prior
notification would enable the Shade Tree Commission to
inspect the site to evaluate the existing street trees and
determine tree preservation and protection measures, if
required. [Amended 12-22-2015 by Ord. No. 1045-1]
[2] The Shade Tree Commission shall be notified by the
Planning Board or the Zoning Board of Adjustment upon
receipt of any application regarding Subsection E(1)
above. The Shade Tree Commission will review and
recommend street tree planting requirements within 15
business days. Plantings shall thereafter be done solely by
an independent contractor engaged by the Shade Tree
Commission and shall not be done by the owner or
developer. [Amended 12-22-2015 by Ord. No. 1045-1]
[3] The Shade Tree Commission requires that one tree be
planted every 30 feet to 50 feet of street curb with a
minimum of two trees per property or as deemed

§ 32B-11. Improvements.
forth the reasons for the exception in the peculiar case and
demonstrates that the exception will not have an adverse effect
on surrounding properties, the neighborhood or the Borough in
general.
A. Required improvements.
(1) Prior to the granting of final approval of a major subdivision or
major site plan, the subdivider or site plan applicant shall have
furnished performance guaranties for the ultimate installation of
the following and shall have completed to the satisfaction of the
Mayor and Council any required on-site, off-site, on-tract or offtract
improvements as follows:
(a) Streets. Streets shall be as approved by the Board and
constructed in accordance with Borough ordinances.
(b) Street signs. Street signs shall be of an approved type subject
to the approval of the Chairman of the Road Committee for the
Borough.
(c) Sidewalks. If sidewalks are designated by the Planning Board,
construction should be in accordance with the Borough
ordinances.
(d) Streetlighting. Streetlighting shall have the approval of the
Borough and shall be designed in conjunction with the utility
company serving the particular area in question.
(e) Shade trees. Shade trees should be located and of such types
as specified by the Shade Tree Commission of the Borough of
Ho-Ho-Kus.
(f) Soil protection. No soil shall be removed from the site or used
as spoil except in accordance with the Borough ordinance
covering the same. Topsoil moved during the course of
construction shall be redistributed so as to provide cover to all
areas of the subdivision and shall be stabilized by seeding or
planting.
(g) Monuments. Monuments should be of the size and shape
required by N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.11, known as "An Act Concerning
the Approval and Filing of Maps," and shall be placed in
accordance with said statute.
(h) Water mains, fire hydrants, gas mains, culverts, storm sewers
and sanitary sewers, or other means of sewage disposal,
drainage structures, erosion control, sedimentation control
devices, public improvements of open space and retaining
walls shall be as approved by the Board.
§ 32B-10 HO-HO-KUS CODE § 32B-11
1:286
(i) Any other improvements required by the Board upon approval
of the preliminary plat.
(j) All of the above-listed improvements shall be subject to
inspection and approval by the Borough Engineer, who shall be
notified by the subdivider at least 48 hours prior to the start of
construction. No underground installation shall be covered
until inspected and approved by the Borough Engineer.
(2) Before granting final subdivision or site plan approval, the Board
shall require that the applicant shall have installed all on-tract
improvements or shall have furnished performance guaranties for
the installation of all on-tract improvements in accordance with
Borough specifications.
B. Off-tract improvements. Any subdivision or site plan which the Board
determines requires off-tract improvements as defined herein shall
comply with the provisions of this subsection:
(1) An off-tract improvement shall be one or more required
improvements which are necessary for the successful completion of
a development in the interest of furthering the public health, safety
and general welfare and where said improvements are located off
tract.
(2) An off-tract improvement shall be required where either the
existing facilities serving the area or subarea are already operating
at a deficient level of service or the inclusion of a new development
will make such present level of service deficient according to
engineering standards utilized in determining such levels of
service.
(3) The proportionate contribution of any such off-tract improvement
to the applicant shall be reasonably related to the relative benefit
or use of the total area so served.
(4) Under the conditions of this subsection, off-tract improvements
shall be limited to new or improved water distribution, sanitary
sewage disposal and distribution and stormwater and drainage
distribution facilities and easements therefor located outside the
property limits of the subdivision or development that are
necessitated or required by construction or improvements within
such subdivision or development, and all necessary appurtenances
thereto and utility easements, and to new or improved street and
right-of-way widths, traffic regulation and control devices,
intersection improvements, utility relocation where not provided
elsewhere and other traffic circulation and safety factors which are
directly related to the property or properties in question. Off-tract
improvements shall not include the improvement costs for an entire
utility system or street system or major segment thereof, including
sewage treatment plants, water supply or treatment facilities or
substantial street construction or improvements or other similar
§ 32B-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 32B-11
1:287
undertaking, unless said improvement is significantly affected by
the property or properties in question.
(5) Each subdivision or site plan requiring authorization by the Board
shall be subject to a determination and finding as follows:
(a) That certain off-tract improvements are or are not necessary to
implement such subdivision.
(b) That, in instances where off-tract improvements are required,
the terms and conditions which shall be imposed upon the
applicant shall ensure the successful and reasonable
implementation of same.
(c) Regulations governing off-tract improvements shall be based
upon circulation and comprehensive utility plans pursuant to
the Master Plan or adopted utility or circulation plans of the
Borough or other governmental or utility authority.
(d) In the event that the Board determines that one or more
improvements constitute an off-tract improvement, the Board,
by resolution, shall notify the governing body of same
specifying the Board's recommendation relative to the
estimated cost of same, the applicant's pro rata share of the
cost and possible methods or means to implement same,
including but not limited to performance and maintenance
guaranties, cash contributions, developer agreements and
other forms of surety.
(e) Action by a Board relating to off-tract improvements shall be
deferred until the governing body has had an opportunity to
review the recommendations of the Board and has made a
determination as to the responsibility it shall accept. It is
clearly understood that the Borough is under no responsibility
to construct, install or provide off-tract improvements to
accommodate a subdivision or site plan approval.
(f) Where an applicant pays the amount determined as the pro
rata share under protest, he shall institute legal action within
one year of such payment in order to preserve the right to a
judicial determination as to the fairness and reasonableness of
such amount. No building permit shall be issued until the
expiration of said one-year period or until such time as the
applicant shall waive such provisions of this chapter.
(g) The Board shall not take any final action on a preliminary
subdivision or site plan until all aspects of such conditions have
been mutually agreed to by both the applicant and the
governing body and a written resolution to that effect by the
governing body has been transmitted to the Board.
§ 32B-11 HO-HO-KUS CODE § 32B-11
1:288
C. Procedure for determination and allocation of costs. In the event that
the Board shall determine that off-tract improvements are required in
connection with any subdivision or site plan, then prior to granting final
approval:
(1) The Board shall report to the Mayor and Council:
(a) The location, character and extent of the required off-tract
improvements;
(b) The Borough Engineer's estimate of the total cost of such offtract
improvements;
(c) The proposed allocation of said total cost determined in
accordance with the standards set forth in Subsection B.
(2) The Mayor and Council shall determine and report to the Board
whether the off-tract improvement will be constructed:
(a) By the Borough as a general improvement or as a local
improvement, or as a combination thereof; or
(b) By the developer with a formula specified by the Borough
providing for partial reimbursement if the improvement
specially benefits property other than that within the
subdivision or site plan.
(3) The Board shall require, as a condition for the approval of the final
plan:
(a) If the improvement is to be constructed by the Borough as a
general improvement, the developer shall deposit with the
Borough Treasurer an amount equal to the difference, if any,
between the estimated cost of the improvement and the
estimated total amount by which all properties, including the
subdivision to be serviced by the improvement or site plan, will
be specially benefited by the improvement;
(b) If the improvement is to be constructed by the Borough as a
local improvement, the developer shall deposit with the
Borough Treasurer, in addition to the amount specified in
Subsection C(3)(a), the estimated amount by which the
subdivision or site plan will be specially benefited by the
improvement; or
(c) If the improvement is to be constructed by the developer, he
shall file with the Borough Clerk a performance guaranty
meeting the requirements of § 32B-12 of this chapter in the full
estimated cost of the improvement.
D. Standards for allocating cost.
§ 32B-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 32B-11
1:289
(1) In determining the allocation of costs for off-tract improvements as
between the developer, other property owners and the Borough,
the Board shall be guided by the following factors:
(a) The total estimated cost of the off-tract improvements.
(b) The increase in market values of the lands affected and any
other benefits conferred.
(c) The needs created by the application.
(d) Population and land use projections for the land within the
general area of the subdivision or site plan and other areas to
be served by the off-tract improvements.
(e) The estimated time for construction of the off-tract
improvements.
(f) The condition and periods of usefulness of the improvements
which may be based upon the criteria of N.J.S.A. 40A:2-22.
(2) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Board may
take into account the following specific factors:
(a) With respect to street, curb, gutter, sidewalk, shade trees,
streetlights, street signs and traffic light improvements, the
Board may consider:
[1] Traffic counts.
[2] Existing and projected traffic patterns.
[3] Quality of roads and sidewalks in the area.
[4] Such other factors as it may deem relevant to the need
created by the subdivision or site plan.
(b) With respect to drainage facilities, the Board may consider:
[1] The relationship between the area of the subdivision or
site plan and the area of the total drainage basin of which
the subdivision or site plan is a part.
[2] The proposed use of land within the subdivision or site
plan and the amount of land area to be covered by
impervious surfaces on the land within the subdivision or
site plan.
[3] The use, condition or status of the remaining land area in
the drainage basin.
(c) With respect to water, gas and electric supply and distribution
facilities, the Board may consider the use requirements of the
use proposed for the subdivision or site plan and the use
§ 32B-11 HO-HO-KUS CODE § 32B-11
1:290
§ 32B-12. Performance guaranty.
requirements of all other properties to be benefited by the
improvements.
(d) With respect to sewerage facilities, the Board may consider:
[1] The anticipated volume of effluent from the use proposed
for the subdivision or site plan and the anticipated volume
of effluent from all other properties to be benefited by the
improvement.
[2] The types of effluent anticipated and particular problems
requiring special equipment or added costs.
E. Deposits. Any money received by the Borough Treasurer for off-tract
improvements to be constructed or installed by the Borough pursuant
to the provisions of this chapter shall be deposited in a suitable
depository therefor and shall be used only for the improvements for
which they are deposited or improvements satisfying the same purpose.
If construction of improvements for which the Borough is responsible
has not commenced within five years from the date of deposit, the
amount deposited with any income thereon shall be returned to the
developer or his successor in interest.
F. Actual costs. Upon completion of any improvement constructed by the
Borough as a general or local improvement, the total cost of such
improvement shall be determined by the Borough Treasurer. The
difference between the actual cost as so determined and the estimated
cost shall be computed. The developer or his successor in interest shall
make remittance to the Borough if the actual cost exceeds the
estimated cost or shall receive a refund from the funds deposited with
the Borough if the estimated cost exceeds the actual cost, in an amount
which bears the same relationship to the difference between the actual
and estimated costs as the amount deposited by the developer for his
proportionate share of the estimated cost bears to the total estimated
cost. Any sum payable by the developer or his successor in interest may
be levied and collected by the Borough in the same manner as is
provided by law for the levy and collection of real estate taxes.
G. Successors in interest. In the absence of an express provision in a deed
or deeds of conveyance, it shall be presumed that the fee owners of all
lots in the subdivision or site plan at the date any deposit or portion
thereof is returned or additional charge is made pursuant to
Subsections C and D are the lawful successors in interest to the
developer, and that each such fee owner shall be charged with or
entitled to receive a pro rata share, based on lot area, of any funds to be
returned or additional charge to be made pursuant to this subsection.
Upon payment of any such sums to said fee owners, the Borough shall
be released of liability to any other person.
§ 32B-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 32B-12
1:291
A. No final site plan or subdivision plat shall be approved by the Board
until the completion of all such required improvements have been
certified to said Board by the Borough Engineer, unless the applicant
shall have filed with the Borough a performance guaranty sufficient in
amount to cover the cost of all such on-site and off-site improvements or
uncompleted portions thereof as estimated by the Borough Engineer
and assuring the installation of such uncompleted improvements on or
before an agreed date.
B. To insure the installation and maintenance of improvements, the Board
may require:
(1) The furnishing of a performance guaranty in favor of the Borough
in an amount not to exceed 120% of the cost of installation for
improvements it may deem necessary or appropriate, including
streets, street signs, grading, pavement, gutters, curbs, sidewalks,
lighting, shade trees and landscaping materials, surveyors'
monuments as shown on the final map and required by the Map
Filing Law, P.L. 1960, c. 141,82 water mains, fire hydrants, culverts,
storm sewers, sanitary sewers or other means of sewage disposal,
drainage structures, erosion control and sedimentation control
devices, public improvements of open space, retaining walls and
other off-site improvements as may be required herein, and, in the
case of site plans only, other on-site improvements and guaranties,
provided that no more than 10% of the total performance guaranty
shall be required to be in cash, and the balance shall be in the form
of a bond from a bonding company approved by the Mayor and
Council and Borough Attorney.
(2) The furnishing of a maintenance guaranty to be posted with the
Mayor and Council for a period not to exceed two years after final
acceptance of the improvements, in an amount not to exceed 15%
of the cost of the improvement. In the event that other
governmental agencies or public utilities automatically will own the
utilities to be installed or the improvements are covered by a
performance or maintenance guaranty to another governmental
agency, no performance or maintenance guaranty, as the case may
be, shall be required for such utilities or improvements.
C. The Borough Engineer shall review the improvements required by the
Board which are to be bonded and itemize their cost. Said itemization
shall be the basis for determining the amount of performance guaranty
and maintenance guaranty required by the Board. The Borough
Engineer shall forward his estimate of the cost of improvements to the
applicant within 30 days of the date of receipt of a request sent by
certified mail for said estimate.
D. The time allowed for installation of the improvements for which the
performance guaranty has been provided may be extended by the
82.Editor's Note: See N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq.
§ 32B-12 HO-HO-KUS CODE § 32B-12
1:292
Mayor and Council by resolution. As a condition or as part of any such
extension, the amount of any performance guaranty shall be increased
or reduced, as the case may be, to an amount not to exceed 120% of the
cost of the installation as determined as of the time of the passage of
the resolution.
E. If the required improvements are not completed or corrected in
accordance with the performance guaranty, the developer and surety, if
any, shall be liable thereon to the Borough for the reasonable cost of the
improvements not completed or corrected, and the Borough may, either
prior to or after the receipt of the proceeds thereof, complete such
improvements.
F. Upon substantial completion of all required appurtenant utility
improvements and the connection of same to the public system, the
developer may notify the Borough in writing, by certified mail
addressed in care of the Borough Clerk, of the completion or substantial
completion of improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the
Borough Engineer. Thereupon, the Borough Engineer shall inspect all
improvements of which such notice has been given and shall file a
detailed report, in writing, with the Mayor and Council, indicating
either approval, partial approval or rejection of such improvements,
with a statement of reasons for any rejection. The cost of the
improvements as approved or rejected shall be set forth.
G. The Mayor and Council shall either approve, partially approve or reject
the improvements, on the basis of the report of the Borough Engineer,
and shall notify the developer, in writing, by certified mail, of the
contents of said report and the action of said Board with relation
thereto not later than 65 days after receipt of the notice from the
developer of the completion of the improvements. Where partial
approval is granted, the developer shall be released from all liability
pursuant to its performance guaranty, except for that portion
adequately sufficient to secure provision of the improvements not yet
approved, provided that 30% of the amount of the performance
guaranty posted may be retained to ensure completion of all
improvements. Failure of the Mayor and Council to send or provide
such notification to the developer within 65 days shall be deemed to
constitute approval of the improvements, and the developer and surety,
if any, shall be released from all liability pursuant to such performance
guaranty for such improvements.
H. If any portion of the required improvements is rejected, the Board may
require the developer to complete such improvements, and, upon
completion, the same procedure of notification, as set forth in this
section, shall be followed.
I. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed to limit the right of the
developer to contest by legal proceedings any determination of the
Mayor and Council or the Borough Engineer.
§ 32B-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 32B-12
1:293
§ 32B-13. Additional deposits.
§ 32B-14. Interpretation; variances.
These rules, regulations and standards shall be considered the minimum
requirements for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare
of the citizens of the Borough. Any action taken by either Board under
the terms of this chapter shall give primary consideration to the abovementioned
matters and to the welfare of the entire community. Nothing
herein contained shall be construed to prohibit or prevent the use of higher
or more restrictive standards or requirements than may appear in any
lawfully applicable statutes, ordinances, regulations, rules, deeds,
restrictions or covenants. However, if the subdivider can clearly
demonstrate that, because of peculiar conditions pertaining to this land,
the literal enforcement of one or more of these regulations is impracticable
or will exact undue hardship, either Board may permit such variance or
variances as may be reasonable and within the general purpose and intent
of the rules, regulations and standards established by this chapter and the
Municipal Land Use Act.83
J. The developer shall reimburse the Borough for all reasonable
inspection fees paid to the Borough Engineer for the foregoing
inspection of improvements, provided that the Borough may require of
the developer a deposit for all or a portion of the reasonably anticipated
fees to be paid to the Borough Engineer for such inspection.
A. In connection with a major subdivision or major site plan, after
preliminary approval by the Planning Board and before any work is
undertaken by the applicant, the applicant shall deposit with the
Borough Clerk of the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus an amount equal to 5% of
the estimated cost of installing the improvements required by the
Planning Board in connection with such major subdivision or site plan
as determined by the Borough Engineer, to cover the cost of periodic
inspection as the improvements are made, including engineering fees
and legal fees in connection therewith. If at any time the amount on
deposit shall fall below the sum of $100, the applicant shall deposit an
additional amount as determined by the Borough Engineer
representing 5% of the estimated cost to complete the improvements in
accordance with the final plat of such major subdivision or site plan.
B. There shall be deposited $250 for each stone monument to ensure
placing of such monument after grading has been completed.
C. All deposited funds shall be disbursed from the trust account of the
Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus by the Borough Treasurer upon submission of
properly certified Borough vouchers detailing the services rendered.
D. All such deposited funds in excess of the payments made therefrom
shall be refunded after the time of approval of the improvements by the
Borough Engineer and Mayor and Council.

conditioned on the final subdivision or site plan approval, any land
which forms a part of a subdivision or site plan for which Borough
approval is required by this chapter, such person shall be subject to
a penalty not to exceed $1,000, and each lot disposition so made
may be deemed a separate violation.
(2) Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the terms of this
chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine not to exceed

an interested party, in addition to other remedies, may institute any
appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such unlawful erection,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion,
maintenance or use; to restrain, correct or abate such violation; to
prevent the occupancy of said building, structure or land; or to prevent
any illegal act, conduct, business or use in or about such premises.
C. Civil remedy for unlawful sale of land.
(1) In addition to the other remedies set forth in this chapter, the
Mayor and Council, the Construction Official and the Building

which violates Subsection A of this section, institute and maintain
an action:
(a) For injunctive relief.
(b) To set aside and invalidate any conveyance made pursuant to
such contract of sale if a certificate as to approval of the
subdivision of land shall not have been issued for such
conveyance.
(2) In any such action, the transferee, purchaser or grantee shall be
entitled to a lien upon the portion of the land from which the
subdivision was made that remains in the possession of the
developer or his assigns or successors, to secure the return of any
deposit made or purchase price paid, and also to a reasonable
search fee, survey expense and title closing expense, if any. Any

suspension or revocation of the license is unlawful, and every day that such
violation continues shall constitute a separate and distinct defense.

or sidewalk or property of the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus within or near the
licensed area.

The licensee agrees, at the end of the license period or in the event that
the license is temporarily or permanently suspended or revoked, that the
licensee will, at his own cost and expense, vacate the sidewalk space and
promptly remove any property placed thereon. Failure to do so on five days'

the period of such training as is authorized by law. The paid leave of
absence shall be in addition to his or her vacation.
C. Employees, subject to the approval of the department head, may take
vacation leave from time to time during the fiscal year in half days,
provided that the department head shall advise the personnel officer by
written memorandum of said vacation arrangement prior to the
employee taking said vacation. Employees shall be required to take the

G. In order that employees may receive the maximum benefit from their
vacations, not more than five days of vacation may be taken one or two
days at a time.
H. All vacations must be scheduled and approved by the department head
or supervisor. It is his or her responsibility to schedule individual
vacations so that activities of the Borough will be carried on with a
minimum of interruption and inconvenience. Employees with seniority
will be given first preference in assignment of vacations. All vacations
over two weeks in length must be approved by the Personnel Officer or
Mayor and Council.
I. Unless specifically authorized by the Borough Council in advance, extra
compensation will not be allowed in lieu of unused vacation leave.
J. Upon the death of an employee, the Borough will pay to an individual

K. The department head shall annually arrange a vacation schedule for
each employee of the department. The department head shall file a
vacation schedule with the Personnel Officer. The department head may
alter the vacation schedule during the fiscal year, if necessary for the

A. Absences from duty are classified "illness," "excused absences,"
"absence without leave" or "vacations" and are to be so noted on the
time report. All authorized leaves of absence will be recorded, together
with the reason for the same.
B. It is the responsibility of each employee to notify their department head
without delay if they will be absent from or delayed in reaching their
assigned post. If unable to reach the department head, the Personnel
Officer should be notified. Failure to report when absent is a serious
offense which cannot be tolerated and may lead to disciplinary action or
dismissal by the Borough Council.
C. In the event of a death in the employee's immediate family or the death
of a close relative residing with the employee, the department head may
grant up to a three-day leave of absence with pay. For the purpose of
this chapter, "member of the immediate family" is interpreted as
§ 42-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 42-4
1:339
§ 42-5. Sick leave.
meaning father, mother, husband, wife, child, sister, brother or close
relative residing with the employee.
D. A leave of absence without pay may be requested by any employee who
will submit, in writing, all facts bearing on the request to their
department head and Council Committee, who will forward the request
to the Borough Council with their recommendations. The Borough
Council will consider each case on its merits and, without establishing a
precedent, make such decision as its judgment dictates at the next
scheduled Council meeting. No leave of absence without pay will be
granted for more than six months.
A. "Sick leave" is hereby defined to mean absence from post of duty of an
employee because of illness, accident or exposure to contagious
disease.
B. Absence of an employee on account of sickness or disability in their
immediate family which necessitates them remaining home to care for
the patient may be charged as sick leave when substantiated and
approved by their department head.
C. In all cases of reported illness or disability, the Borough reserves the
right to send a medical physician to examine and report on the
condition of the patient to the Mayor and Council.
D. When the absence on account of illness or disability does not exceed
three successive workdays, the employee's statement of the cause may
be accepted without a supporting statement from their attending
physician.
E. Every absence on account of illness or disability in excess of three
workdays must be certified by a written statement from the attending
physician, using the form provided by the Borough for that purpose.
The Borough also reserves the right to waive this requirement or to
require the employees to be examined and certified as fit for duty
before returning to work by a medical physician designated by the
Borough Council.
F. During protracted periods of illness or disability, the Borough may
require interim reports on the condition of the patient at weekly periods
from the attending physician and/or physician designated by the
Borough Council. When under medical care, employees are expected to
conform to the instructions of the attending physician if they wish to
qualify for salary payment during such period of illness of disability.
G. Payment of wages. [Amended 3-28-2000 by Ord. No. 824]
(1) The rules which follow apply to the payment of salaries or wages
during periods of illness or disability of full-time or permanent
employees. Temporary employees are not entitled to compensation
§ 42-4 HO-HO-KUS CODE § 42-5
1:340
for such absence. Full-time or permanent employees of the
Borough shall be entitled to the following periods of sick leave with
full pay, with the provision, however, that in the event that said sick
leave is not used in any one year, up to 20 days of such leave may
accumulate for use in future years, up to a maximum of 135 days'
accumulated sick leave:
(a) Six months to five years of continuous service: per annum sick
leave of 10 workdays.
(b) Five to 10 years of continuous service: per annum sick leave of
20 workdays.
(c) Ten or more years of continuous service: per annum sick leave
of 30 workdays.
(2) No employee shall be entitled to take sick pay in lieu of sick leave,
with the exception of a member who retires after 25 years of
service. Such a member shall, upon retirement, be entitled to a
lump sum payment for accumulated sick days at their rate of salary
existing at the time of retirement as follows:
(a) Full pay for sick days accumulated to a maximum of 135 days,
provided that no sick leave was taken during the calendar year
prior to retirement.
(b) In the event that sick leave was taken during the calendar year
prior to retirement, the number of sick days taken as sick leave
shall be deducted from the maximum sick days accumulated
(maximum 135 days) to determine the number of days to which
compensation will be received as a lump sum retirement
payment.
H. Sick leave with pay will not be allowed under the following conditions:
(1) If the employee, when under medical care, fails to carry out the
orders of the attending physician.
(2) If, in the opinion of the medical physician designated by the
Borough Council, the employee is ill or disabled because of selfimposed
contributory causes or actions occasioned by bad habits.
(3) If, in the opinion of the medical physician designated by the
Borough Council, the disability or illness is not of sufficient severity
to justify the employee's absence from duty.
(4) If, in the opinion of the medical physician designated by the
Borough Council, the employee on sick leave can be assigned to
other temporary Borough work of dissimilar nature than their
regular job and the employee refuses to perform the same.
§ 42-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 42-5
1:341
§ 42-6. Absence due to disability caused in performance of duties.
(5) If the employee does not cooperate with the medical physician
designated by the Borough Council and permit examination at the
Borough's convenience relative to their return to Borough work.
I. The recommendations of the medical physician designated by the
Borough Council, as well as those of the attending physician, as to the
justification of the absence from duty on account of disability or illness,
or of the fitness of the employee to return to duty, shall be considered
by the Borough Council. In the event that there is a disagreement, the
Borough Council will then make a decision in the matter.
J. If an employee is in need of frequent and/or weekly and/or biweekly
medical sessions and requests to be excused early, or at any time during
the work day, from assigned duties, then such requests must be made,
in writing, from the medical doctor or the physiotherapist or the
appropriate certified health care provider who is providing the
treatment. Such request must state the approximate time frame for the
appointments, the approximate number of visits required and that the
appointments could not be held at any other time and why. Employees,
at times, are faced with a decision regarding elective surgery. Elective
surgery should be scheduled for departmental nonpeak periods, and
the dates must be preapproved by the department head.
K. An employee shall be entitled to no credit for unused sick time for prior
services, if the employee's service to the Borough has been previously
terminated for any reason.
A. An employee who is certified as absent on account of a disability or
accident caused in the usual course of their employment and directly in
line of duty shall not have such absence charged against their sick
leave. All other provisions regarding absence on account of sickness or
disability apply.
B. If the injury is sufficiently severe to keep an employee off duty and they
have given notice of the disability or accident in accordance with this
chapter and the applicable laws and regulations, they shall receive
payment of such amount so that the payment from the Borough, made
together with payments received under the Workers' Compensation
Act, will equal their regular salary for the first three months and 1/2
their regular salary for the next three months, provided that they are
receiving payments under the Workers' Compensation Act. Should the
injury extend beyond six months and the employee is then unable to
return to work, the employee, at their option, may use sick leave and/or
vacation time.
C. Nothing herein contained shall be considered to be in derogation of or
restrictive of any statute now in effect limiting the period during which
municipal employees may be compensated for leave on account of
§ 42-5 HO-HO-KUS CODE § 42-6
1:342
§ 42-7. Tenure.

five or more years of consecutive service with the Borough shall not be
removed from Borough employment except for good cause shown after a
fair and impartial hearing, but shall continue to be employed during good
behavior and efficiency. This provision shall not apply to any employee who
is employed for a fixed term or who is given tenure of office by statute or
other ordinance. This section shall not apply to any employee hired after the
effective date hereof.
§ 42-8. Probation.
Any employee who is employed by the Borough shall be on probation for a
period of six months after the date of their employment, unless otherwise

administered in conjunction therewith.
D. An employee who is injured while working must make an immediate
report of such injury to their department head. All injuries, no matter
how slight, must be reported within eight hours. If the employee is
injured to such an extent that they require medical attention, the
employee shall immediately go to an authorized doctor/medical facility
for treatment. Department heads shall be responsible for notifying the
Personnel Officer and Borough Clerk. The Borough Clerk shall notify
the insurance company and the certifying agent of the appropriate
retirement system (where applicable) of all injuries reported by
employees under their supervision and shall make certain that the
proper written reports are made.
E. An employee shall reimburse the Borough for moneys he or she may
receive as workers compensation from any legal settlement or
judgment against the person(s) or entities responsible for the injury.
F. In the event that an employee shall sustain an injury which renders him
unable to return to work for the first three months thereafter, the
employee shall receive his regular net salary from the Borough, less any
amounts received from worker's compensation benefits, disability, nofault
or any other type or insurance coverage. For the next three
months thereafter, he shall receive 1/2 of his net salary from the
Borough, less any amounts received from workers' compensation
benefits, disability, no-fault or any other type of insurance coverage. To
the extent that any such salary benefits have been paid by the Borough,
the Borough shall have a lien against any recovery, whether by way of
settlement or verdict, against any person responsible for said injury.

notice and equal access to the promotional process, and to identify
the most qualified members of the department for promotion to
leadership positions within the department, the following
promotional process shall be employed for promotions to all
superior positions (Sergeant, Lieutenant, and Captain), other than
the Chief of Police.

compliance with N.J.S.A. 40A:14-129, which provides that a
promotion of any member or officer of the Police Department to a
superior position shall be made from the membership of the
department and due consideration shall be given to the length and
merit of his/her service and preference shall be given according to
seniority in service. The Chief of Police shall be responsible for the
administration of the promotional process.
B. Promotion to rank of Sergeant.
(1) Eligibility. No person shall be eligible for promotion to the rank of
Sergeant unless the candidate has served as a police officer with
the Ho-Ho-Kus Police Department for at least five years, and
possesses a minimum of an associate's degree (AA) or its
equivalent, i.e., a minimum of 60 college credits, preferably in a
social science, although not required.
(2) The testing process for the above position will consist of the
following:
(a) Written examination. Written examination administered by the
New Jersey State Association of Chiefs of Police ("Chief's
Association") or such other written examination approved by
the governing body and administered by the Chief of Police.
[1] The written examination shall account for 50% of a
candidate's total promotional score, up to a maximum of
50 total points.
[2] Each candidate's total point score for the written
examination shall be computed by taking a candidate's
score on the written exam (which exam shall have 100
points as its maximum score) and multiplying same by
50%. By way of example, a candidate receiving a score of
§ 46-8 HO-HO-KUS CODE § 46-9
1:360
80 points on his/her written examination shall receive 40
total points for the written examination element of the
promotional process (80 x 50% = 40 total points).
[3] To be eligible to proceed to the oral examinations by the
Interview Panel and the appropriate authority, a candidate
must achieve a minimum score of 70 points out of said
maximum of 100 points on the written examination (i.e., at

total points). Oral examinations by the Interview Panel
shall take place after the receipt of the written
examination scores.

(which examination and assessment shall have 100 points
as its maximum score) shall account for 25% of the
candidate's total promotional score, with 25 total points

and assessment. By way of example, a candidate receiving
a score of 80 points on his/her oral examination by the

appropriate authority's receipt of the results of the
Interview Panel's oral examination. The Chief of Police
shall be available to the appropriate authority during such
process, and may sit in on such process, for advice and
counsel. However, the scoring of this portion shall be
computed by the appropriate authority only. This
evaluation shall have 100 points as its maximum score and
shall account for 25% of the candidate's total promotional
score, with 25 total points being the highest possible
score. By way of example, a candidate receiving a score of
80 points shall receive 20 total points (80 x 25% = 20 total
points).
[4] Due consideration shall be given to the eligible candidate
for promotion based upon length of service and merit of
service, and preference shall be given according to
seniority pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40A:14-129.

[2] The oral examination and assessment by the Interview
Panel shall include an evaluation of the following criteria:

intervention summaries, annual performance evaluations,
merit, overall performance, demonstrated ability and
accomplishments, efforts supporting department goals
and objectives, in-service education and specialized
schools, specialized job assignments, responsibilities,

Such notice shall be in writing and shall include a concise statement of

prevention, cessation or cure of the condition violated cannot reasonably
be effected within the ten-day period; and, in such cases, the enforcement

other provision of this code, such order shall be effective immediately.

immediately, but, upon objection in writing to the enforcement officer, any
§ 47-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 47-16

such person shall be afforded a hearing before the governing body of the
Borough as soon as is reasonably possible. After such a hearing and decision

such order is continued.

any Borough officer or employee shall be deemed to be government records,
as that term is defined by N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1, and such records shall be
subject to inspection by the public unless exempt under the statute or other
regulation, common law practice, executive order of the Governor, Rules of
Court, federal law or judicial decision.
§ 51-2. Custodian of records; records request form.
In accordance with N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1, the Municipal Clerk is designated as
the custodian of records. The Clerk shall adopt a form for the use of any
person who requests access to a record, and such form shall contain all of
the information required by N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5f.
§ 51-3. Inspection and copying of public records.
A. Any person seeking to inspect, examine or copy a public record of this

public records shall be as specific as possible, including the type of
record and date created, if known.

examine, copy or provide a copy of a government record. If the Clerk is
unable to comply with a request for access, he or she shall indicate on
the request form the specific basis for such inability to comply and shall
promptly return it to the requestor. The Clerk shall sign and date the
form and provide the requestor with a copy thereof.
C. In those instances where the nature of the request or the record itself
leads the Municipal Clerk to doubt whether or not the record is a
government record as defined by law or is a record exempt from
disclosure, the Clerk shall request an opinion from the Municipal
Attorney. A copy of the request form shall be forwarded to the Attorney,
who, after review and investigation, shall issue an opinion and note
such opinion on the request form and promptly return it to the
Municipal Clerk. If any part of a particular record is exempt from public
access pursuant to N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 et seq., the Clerk shall delete,
redact or excise from a copy of the record that portion which is exempt
from access and shall promptly permit access to the remainder of the
record.
D. If the record requested is temporarily unavailable because it is in use or
in storage, the Clerk shall so advise the requestor and shall make
arrangements to make a copy of the record available.
E. If a request for access to a government record would substantially
disrupt municipal operations, the Clerk may deny access to the record
after attempting to reach a reasonable solution with the requestor that
accommodates the interests of the requestor and the municipality.

or executive order, the Clerk shall grant access to a government record or
deny a request for access to a record as soon as possible, but not later than
seven business days after receiving the request, provided that the record
is currently available and not in storage or archived. In the event that the
Clerk fails to respond within seven business days after receiving a request,
the failure to respond shall be deemed a denial of the request, unless the
requestor has elected not to provide a name, address or telephone number,
or other means of contacting the requestor. If the requestor has elected
not to provide a name, address, or telephone number, or other means of
contacting the requestor, the Clerk shall not be required to respond until
the requestor reappears before the custodian seeking a response to the
original request. If the government record is in storage or archived, the
requestor shall be so advised within seven business days after the Clerk
receives the request. The requestor shall be advised by the Clerk when the
record can be made available. If the record is not made available by that
time, access shall be deemed denied.

for a period of time exceeding 1/2 hour, the requestor shall be

shall be selected so it contains no stones. All backfill material for the
trench shall be placed by tamping in eight-inch layers so as to avoid any
settlement. When the trench has been filled to the proper height, the
surface material shall be replaced and heavily tamped and rolled.
C. Where the trench is excavated in rock, the rock must be carefully
excavated to a depth of six inches below the grade line of the sewer, and

curb in each such case, or, in any instance where the connection to the
house sewer lateral requires the performance of labor or the furnishing of
materials on the part of the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus, a minimum charge of
$100 will be made. Where, because of the nature and extent of the work
to be done or the pavement or terrain to be penetrated or the width of the
road or any such circumstances, the sum of $100 is not sufficient to cover
the costs and expenses of the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus, the Borough Engineer

the integrity of the employment relationship. Sexual harassment debilitates
morale and interferes with work productivity and, therefore, will not be
tolerated.
§ 56A-4. Complaint procedure.
§ 56A-5. Contents of filing.
A. Supervisory. In order to ensure the integrity of the work environment,
supervisory personnel are required to ensure adherence to and
compliance with this policy and, upon being informed of possible sexual
harassment, are required to take appropriate immediate action in
response, including informing employees of their right to file a
discrimination complaint with the Personnel Officer.
B. Employee. Employees are encouraged, whether directly or through a
third party, to notify the alleged harasser that the behavior in question
is offensive and unwelcome. However, failure to do so does not preclude
filing a complaint. Employees are encouraged to promptly report all
alleged incidents of sexual harassment to the Personnel Officer.
A. The complaint filed must include the following information:
(1) The name and department of the complainant;
(2) The name and department of the charged party;
(3) The nature and circumstances, in detail, of the alleged sexual
harassment, including but not limited to the injuries or
consequences suffered by the complainant, the names of any
witnesses to such actions and the duration of the actions
questioned; and
(4) Whether such harassment has been previously reported to a
supervisor or other person and, if so, when and to whom.
B. Nothing in this section shall prevent the complainant from providing
other information or documents they believe are essential to the fair
adjudication of their case.
C. The initial complaint must be made in writing.
D. The Personnel Officer is hereby designated as the sexual harassment
officer. The Chief Financial Officer of the Borough is hereby designated
as the alternate officer, unless the Chief Financial Officer is one and the
same as the Personnel Officer, in which event the Assistant Treasurer
will become the alternate. Persons who, by reason of the circumstances,
are uncomfortable directing a complaint to the Personnel Officer may
report the same to the alternate officer.
§ 56A-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 56A-6
1:499
§ 56A-6. Investigation of filed complaints.
A complaint of sexual harassment shall be investigated by the Personnel
Officer or the alternate in a timely manner and shall include, but not be
limited to:
§ 56A-7. Confidentiality.
To the extent possible, the sexual harassment investigative proceedings will
be conducted in a manner to protect the confidentiality of the complainant,
the alleged harasser and all witnesses. All parties involved in the
proceedings will be advised to maintain strict confidentiality, from the initial
meeting to the final decision, to safeguard the privacy and reputation of all
involved.
§ 56A-8. Retaliation prohibited.
It shall be a violation of this policy for any employee to take reprisals against
any person because she/he has filed a complaint, testified or assisted in any
proceeding under this policy. Threats, other forms of intimidation and/or
retaliation against the complainant or any other party based on involvement
in the complaint process may be cause for disciplinary action.
§ 56A-9. Protection of all parties.
All complaints will be addressed by the Personnel Officer or alternate. The
alleged harasser will be notified once a formal complaint is filed with the
Personnel Officer or alternate. A finding of no probable cause as a result of
an investigation does not necessarily establish that an accusation is false.
However, this policy shall not be used to intentionally bring frivolous or
malicious charges against an employee.
§ 56A-10. Disciplinary action.
Disciplinary action for employees found in violation of this policy may be
progressive in nature, but is not required to be, and may include:
A. Interviewing the complainant in detail.
B. Interviewing all potential witnesses, including those persons who may
have knowledge of similar incidents.
C. Interviewing the charged party in detail.
D. Reviewing municipal files for similar incidents involving the
complainant and the charged party.
E. Assessing the presence or absence of corroborative evidence for either
party.
A. Written reprimand.
B. Suspension (with or without pay).

obtained as a result of a decision of a nonlocal agency or court of superior
administrative remedies described herein.
§ 56A-12. Training.
Employees of the Borough shall be provided with training, by a person
trained to lead or implement such training, which shall include a detailed
discussion of the following:

Specifications
[Adopted 4-24-1962 by Ord. No. 380]
§ 58-1. Curbs.
All curbs in the Borough shall be constructed strictly in accordance with the
specifications hereinafter set forth.
A. Dimensions. Unless otherwise specified, concrete curbs shall be
constructed in accordance with the "Typical Curb Section for Municipal
Roads" herein shown as Figure 1.130 The approximate dimensions are:
depth, 18 inches; top width, six inches; width at 1/2 depth, nine inches;
and bottom width, nine inches. The batter on the front face shall be
three inches in nine inches and the rear face shall be vertical. The top
face of the curb shall be velled or sloped at the rate of 1/4 inch per foot,
and the radius of the outside edge shall be one inch.
B. Forms.
(1) The forms used may be of metal, or of thoroughly seasoned and
dressed lumber, not less than two inches in thickness. Forms must
be placed in proper alignment and thoroughly staked and braced.
Before any concrete is deposited, the forms shall be clean and free
from dirt and thoroughly oiled. Forms which have become bent or
warped, and which in the opinion of the Borough Engineer are
unsuitable for use, will be rejected and shall be removed from the
site of the work.
(2) Forms for radius curb may be of metal or, if constructed of wood,
shall be not more than 1/2 inch in thickness, dressed and
thoroughly battered together. They shall be so set to give the same
batter of the street face as straight curb.
C. Body of curbs. Concrete for curbs shall be Class B air-entrained
portland cement concrete, in accordance with the 1961 New Jersey
State Highway Department Standard Specifications, except that the
stone shall be 3/4 inch. As the concrete is placed into the forms, it shall
be thoroughly tamped and compacted or vibrated to insure that it
completely fills the forms and that all stone is completely imbedded in
the mortar. After the concrete has sufficient set and strength, the
outside edge of the curb shall be properly rounded with a curb-edging
tool having a radius of one inch. The face of the forms shall be removed
and the outside faces of the curb rubbed and finished with a steel float.
Plastering will not be permitted, and the use of gravel in any form is
absolutely prohibited. [Amended 10-24-1967 by Ord. No. 439]
D. Joints. The curb shall be constructed in sections 10 feet long. Each
section is to be separated by a three-sixteenths-inch metal form plate or

§ 58-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-1
1:513
§ 58-2. Sidewalks. [Amended 10-24-1967 by Ord. No. 439]
All sidewalks in the Borough shall be constructed strictly in accordance with
the specifications hereinafter set forth.
other accepted material having the approval of the Borough Engineer.
The plates shall extend through the whole thickness and depth of the
curb. The plates shall act as spacing plates to the forms, and the joints
so formed will serve to take up expansion and contraction.
E. Driveway openings. Where required, driveway openings shall be
provided by lowering or depressing the top of the curb five inches
below normal elevation across the entire width of the driveway. Care is
to be taken to provide a neat and attractive transition from the normal
curb height to the depressed curb height.
A. Excavation. The subgrade shall be prepared and properly tamped to a
depth of eight inches below finished grade of the sidewalk.
B. Dimensions. Unless otherwise specified, concrete sidewalk shall be
constructed in accordance with the sidewalk as shown on "Typical Half
Section of Road" herein shown as Figure 2.131
C. Forms. Sidewalk forms may be of metal or wood and, if of wood, shall be
not less than two inches by four inches and free from warps or bends.
All forms must be thoroughly braced and staked to the established lines
and grades.
D. Foundation. Upon the subgrade shall be placed a layer of clean sand
having a compacted thickness of four inches.
E. Body of sidewalk. Concrete for sidewalks shall be Class C air-entrained
portland cement concrete in accordance with the 1961 New Jersey
State Highway Department Standard Specifications, except that the
stone shall be 3/4 inch. Concrete shall be placed in the forms and on the
prepared foundation to a thickness of four inches, minimum. After
being placed, the concrete shall be tamped, screened and finished to
true grade and even surface. Care is to be taken to insure that the
concrete completely fills the forms and that all stone is completely
imbedded in the mortar. After the concrete has sufficiently set, the
finish shall be applied with a wooden float so that a slightly roughened
surface is obtained. The surface shall then be brushed with a wet softhaired
brush to obtain a neat surface. Expansion joints 3/16 inch wide
shall be provided every five feet, and the joints filled with sand. All
exposed edges of the sidewalk and joints shall be rounded with a
sidewalk-edging tool having a radius of 1/2 inch. [Amended
10-24-1967 by Ord. No. 439]

§ 58-3. Streets.
All streets in the Borough shall be constructed strictly in accordance with
the specifications hereinafter set forth:
concrete for the sidewalk shall be six inches, and the sidewalk
constructed in the manner outlined above. Between the sidewalk and
the curb, a concrete apron shall be constructed. This apron shall have a
uniform slope from the grade of the sidewalk to the top of the depressed
curb. This apron shall be constructed in the manner as outlined above
for a concrete sidewalk, except the concrete shall be five inches thick
and no sand shall be placed under the apron.
A. Dimensions. Roads and pavement shall be constructed in accordance
with "Typical Half Section of Road" herein shown as Figure 2.132
B. Formation of subgrade.
(1) The surface upon which the pavement is to be placed shall be
known as a subgrade and must conform to the lines and grades and
cross sections given.
(2) After all drains have been laid, and all frames and heads of
manholes, catch basins and other structures have been reset at
proper grade, and subgrade has been shaped correctly, it shall be
brought to a firm unyielding surface by rolling the entire area with
a three-wheel, ten-ton power roller. Any portions of the subgrade
which are not accessible to the roller shall be thoroughly
compacted with hand tampers weighing not less than 50 pounds,
the face of which shall not exceed 100 square inches. All places in
the subgrade which do not attain the required stability or compact
properly when rolled shall be excavated and replaced with suitable
material.
(3) No base or surface material shall be dumped or deposited on a
subgrade that has not the required stability, is not at the proper
grade, or does not have the specified cross section. The subgrade
shall not be disturbed by any unnecessary carting or hauling upon
it, but if the surface is disturbed, the same shall be reshaped and
rerolled before the spreading of any foundation material.
Projections or high places shall be reduced and all depressions
filled, and filling and rolling shall continue until the subgrade has a
uniform, even surface at the required grade and crown and has the
required density and solidity at all points. Should the existing
subbase material be judged unstable, or in any way not acceptable,
by the Borough Engineer, this material shall be excavated to a
depth that the Engineer shall deem necessary and replaced with an
acceptable subbase material, and the subgrade formed as outlined
above.
132. Editor's Note: Figure 2 is on file in the Borough offices.
§ 58-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 58-3
1:515
C. Macadam foundation.
(1) After the subgrade has been properly prepared as herein specified,
two-and-one-half-inch stone shall be deposited thereon in a uniform
layer having a depth when compacted of four inches unless
otherwise shown on plans. When ordered by the Engineer, the
thickness of the loose stone shall be measured by wooden blocks of
the required depth. No stone shall be placed upon a wet subgrade.
(2) As soon as the stone has been properly spread, it shall be rolled
with a three-wheel power roller, weighing not less than 10 tons,
until thoroughly consolidated and compacted to a smooth, even
surface. During the initial rolling, the roller shall travel parallel to
the axis of the pavement, beginning at each edge and working
toward the center. The subsequent rolling shall be both diagonal
and parallel to the axis of the pavement, so that every part of the
stone surface receives compression from the rear wheels of the
roller.
(3) After the stone has been properly rolled, screenings shall be spread
in layers not over 1/2 inch in thickness and worked into the voids
thereof with intermittent rolling between each application until all
voids have been filled and the stone ceases to creep or sink under
the roller and is at the proper grade. Before and until the surface
pavement is applied on this foundation, it must be firmly bound
together, be at the proper grade, have the required crown, and be
free from ruts, loose stone, places showing instability and stone
covered with sufficient binder as to hide the top faces and edges.
(4) If at any time during the construction of the foundation the
subgrade shows evidence of instability, is forced below grade or up
into the voids of the stone, the contractor shall dig out all such
loose or unstable material, reshape and repack the subgrade in the
manner ordered by the Engineer, and shall replace the stone
removed with the necessary additional stone, which, when bound
and rolled as herein specified, shall give the required stability.
D. Modified penetration macadam intermediate course.
(1) After the foundation course has been prepared as herein specified,
a uniform layer of one-and-one-half-inch stone shall be spread over
its surface to a depth of two inches compacted.
(2) As soon as the stone has been properly spread, it shall be rolled
with a three-wheel power roller, weighing not less than 10 tons,
until thoroughly consolidated and compacted to a smooth, even
surface. Additional three-quarter-inch stone shall be added when,
in the opinion of the Engineer, the interstices would require too
much bitumen to properly fill, and the rolling continued until the
surface is thoroughly compacted. During the initial rolling, the
roller shall travel parallel to the axis of the pavement, beginning at
each edge and working toward the center. The subsequent rolling

§ 58-4. Strict compliance required.
Any person who shall construct, remove, repair, replace, reset or alter
the curb, sidewalk or street or cause the construction, removal, repair,
replacement or altering of the curb, sidewalk or street shall do so strictly
in accordance with the above specifications and under the supervision and
inspection of the Borough Engineer and shall pay such reasonable fee for
said inspection as may be required.
§ 58-5. Violations and penalties.
A person violating any of the provisions of this article shall, upon conviction,
be subject to a fine not to exceed the sum of $100 and, upon default in the
payment of said fine, may be imprisoned in the county jail for a term not to

that every part of the stone surface receives compression from the
rear wheels of the roller.
E. Application of bitumen.
(1) Bituminous binder Grade OA-4 or NA-4 shall then be applied at the
rate of 1.65 to 1.75 gallons per square yard or surface, applied from
an approved pressure distributor, which must be equipped with
stationary Fahrenheit thermometers for accurately indicating
temperatures of bitumen. No bitumen shall be applied when the
atmospheric temperature is below 50° F. or has been below 40° F.
within the preceding eight hours.
(2) When bituminous binder is applied, it must have a temperature
between 300° F. and 350° F.
(3) While the bitumen is still warm, a uniform layer of five-eighths-inch
stone shall be spread in sufficient quantity to fill the voids. The
stone shall be taken from piles adjacent to the road deposited there
before the bitumen is spread. The road surface shall be rolled until
the stone is thoroughly imbedded in the bitumen and anchored in
place. If bitumen appears on the surface in such quantity as to stick
to the wheels of the roller, additional stone must be applied at such
points. The rolling shall be continued until the surface is firmly
bound together, hard and smooth, and shows no perceptible
movement under the roller.
F. Bituminous concrete surface course: hot mix. After the modified
penetration macadam intermediate course has been constructed, there
shall be placed upon it a bituminous concrete surface course 1 1/2
inches thick when compacted. The top course shall consist of hot mix
bituminous concrete, New Jersey State Highway Specifications, Type
FA-BC-1 or Type S.M.1. The top course shall be constructed in
accordance with the 1961 New Jersey State Highway Department
standard specifications.

permit granted pursuant to this article. The amount of the bond shall be
100% of the estimated cost of the work to be done by the permittee. The
term of the bond shall begin upon the date of posting thereof and shall

extended if permission is requested in writing and approved by the
Borough Council.
B. Restrictions upon opening streets. No permit shall be issued by the
Borough Clerk to any person given notice under Subsection A hereof

work be permitted or unless an emergency condition exists.
C. Penalty for opening streets. If, by a special action of the Borough
Council, a permit is issued to open any paved and improved street
surface less than five years old, a penalty charge shall be made for the
opening, except that the penalty shall be waived in the event the work is
of an emergency nature. The penalty charge shall be on a sliding scale
and shall be equal to 2% of the cost of restoring the opening for each
unelapsed month or fraction thereof of the five-year restricted period.

B. Notices to property owners and tenants. If the work to be undertaken

A. The general intent of this chapter is to manage the increased rate and
velocity of surface water runoff created by certain alterations of the
ground cover and natural runoff patterns.
B. This chapter is deemed essential and necessary to protect the public
health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus
and the surrounding communities by accomplishing the following
purposes:
(1) To reduce flood damage to public health, life and property.
(2) To minimize increased stormwater runoff from any new land
development.
(3) To maintain the adequacy of existing and proposed culverts and
bridges.
(4) To induce water recharge into the ground, where practical.
(5) To prevent, to the greatest extent feasible, any increase in nonpoint
source pollution.
(6) To maintain the integrity of stream channels for their biological
functions as well as for drainage and other purposes.
(7) To reduce the impact of development upon stream erosion in areas
where this would be detrimental.
(8) To reduce erosion from any development or construction project.
(9) To minimize the increases in runoff pollution due to land
development which otherwise would degrade the quality of water
and might render it both unfit for human consumption and
detrimental to biological life.
(10) To preserve and protect water supply facilities and water resources
by means of controlling harmful flood discharges, stream erosion
and runoff pollution.

A. General standards.
(1) The rate of surface water runoff from the site for ten-, thirty-, and
one-hundred-year frequency storms considered individually
following project completion shall not exceed that which prevailed
prior to the disturbance or which would have prevailed under total
site coverage in a pasture of good hydrologic condition, whichever
is most restrictive.
(2) Efforts shall be made to minimize the land disturbance, the
introduction of impervious surfaces and the alteration of recharge
areas.
(3) Natural retention areas such as ponds, depressions and marshes
shall be preserved and integrated into the management plan to the
greatest extent possible.
(4) Surface water shall not be transferred from one watershed to
another.

Requirements and Controls for Major Development
§ 66A-1. Policy; purpose; applicability; effect on other
requirements.
A. Policy statement. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant
reduction through nonstructural or low-impact techniques shall be
explored before relying on structural best management practices
(BMPs). Structural BMPs should be integrated with nonstructural
stormwater management strategies and proper maintenance plans.
Nonstructural strategies include both environmentally sensitive site
design and source controls that prevent pollutants from being placed on
the site or from being exposed to stormwater. Source control plans
should be developed based upon physical site conditions and the origin,
nature, and the anticipated quantity or amount of potential pollutants.
Multiple stormwater management BMPs may be necessary to achieve
the established performance standards for water quality, quantity, and
groundwater recharge.
B. Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for major
development, as defined in § 66A-2.
C. Applicability.
(1) This article shall be applicable to all site plans and subdivisions for
the following major developments that require preliminary or final
site plan or subdivision review:

§ 66A-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 66A-3
1:585
§ 66A-4. Specific requirements.
A. Stormwater management measures for major development shall be
developed to meet the erosion control, groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality standards in
§ 66A-4. To the maximum extent practicable, these standards shall be
met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater management strategies
into the design. If these strategies alone are not sufficient to meet these
standards, structural stormwater management measures necessary to
meet these standards shall be incorporated into the design.
B. The standards in this article apply only to new major development and
are intended to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on water
quality and water quantity in receiving water bodies and maintain
groundwater recharge. The standards do not apply to new major
development to the extent that alternative design and performance
standards are applicable under a regional stormwater management
plan or water quality management plan adopted in accordance with
Department rules. Such alternative standards shall provide at least as
much protection from stormwater-related loss of groundwater
recharge, stormwater quantity and water quality impacts of major
development projects as would be provided under the standards in this
article.
C. For site improvements regulated under the Residential Site
Improvement Standards (RSIS) at N.J.A.C. 5:21, the RSIS shall apply in
addition to this section, except to the extent the RSIS are superseded by
this section or alternative standards applicable under a regional
stormwater management plan or water quality management plan
adopted in accordance with Department rules.
A. The development shall incorporate a maintenance plan for the
stormwater management measures incorporated into the design of a
major development in accordance with § 66A-10.
B. Stormwater management measures shall avoid adverse impacts of
concentrated flow on habitats for threatened and endangered species
as documented in the Department's Landscape Project or Natural
Heritage Database established under N.J.S.A. 13:1B-15.147 through
13:1B-15.150, particularly Helonias bullata (swamp pink) and/or
Clemmys muhlenbergi (bog turtle).
C. The following linear development projects are exempt from the
groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater
runoff quality requirements of § 66A-4F and G:
(1) The construction of an underground utility line, provided that the
disturbed areas are revegetated upon completion;
§ 66A-3 HO-HO-KUS CODE § 66A-4
1:586
(2) The construction of an aboveground utility line, provided that the
existing conditions are maintained to the maximum extent
practicable; and
(3) The construction of a public pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk
or trail with a maximum width of 14 feet, provided that the access
is made of permeable material.
D. A waiver from strict compliance from the groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
requirements of § 66A-4F and G may be obtained for the enlargement of
an existing public roadway or railroad or the construction or
enlargement of a public pedestrian access, provided that the following
conditions are met:
(1) The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the
project that cannot be accomplished by any other means;
(2) The applicant demonstrates, through an alternatives analysis, that
through the use of nonstructural and structural stormwater
management strategies and measures, the option selected
complies with the requirements of § 66A-4F and G to the maximum
extent practicable;
(3) The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the requirements
of § 66A-4F and G, existing structures currently in use, such as
homes and buildings, would need to be condemned; and
(4) The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other
rights to areas, including the potential to obtain, through
condemnation, lands not falling under § 66A-4D(3) above within the
upstream drainage area of the receiving stream, that would provide
additional opportunities to mitigate the requirements of § 66A-4F
and G that were not achievable on site.
E. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in § 66A-4F and
G shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies set forth at § 66A-4E into the design. The
applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures incorporated
into the design of the project. If the applicant contends that it is not
feasible for engineering, environmental, or safety reasons to
incorporate any nonstructural stormwater management strategies
identified under § 66A-4E(2) below into the design of a particular
project, the applicant shall identify the strategy considered and
provide a basis for the contention.
(2) Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated
into the site design shall:

trash and debris in drainage systems, including features
that satisfy § 66A-4E(3) below;
[2] Site design features that help to prevent discharge of trash
and debris from drainage systems;
[3] Site design features that help to prevent and/or contain
spills or other harmful accumulations of pollutants at
industrial or commercial developments; and
[4] When establishing vegetation after land disturbance,
applying fertilizer in accordance with the requirements
established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and implementing rules.
(3) Site design features identified under § 66A-4E(2)(i)[2] above shall
comply with the following standard to control passage of solid and
floatable materials through storm drain inlets. For exemptions to
this standard, see § 66A-4E(3)(c) below.
(a) Grates.
§ 66A-4 HO-HO-KUS CODE § 66A-4
1:588
[1] Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a
storm drain or surface water body under that grate:
[a] The New Jersey Department of Transportation
(NJDOT) bicycle-safe grate, which is described in
Chapter 2.4 of the NJDOT Bicycle Compatible
Roadways and Bikeways Planning and Design
Guidelines (April 1996); or
[b] A different grate, if each individual clear space in that
grate has an area of no more than seven square inches
or is no greater than 0.5 inch across the smallest
dimension.
[2] Examples of grates subject to this standard include grates
in grate inlets, the grate portion (non-curb-opening
portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm sewer
manholes, ditch grates, trench grates, and grates of spacer
bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground surfaces
include surfaces of roads (including bridges), driveways,
parking areas, bikeways, plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields,
open channels, and stormwater basin floors.
(b) Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear
space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if
the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an
area of no more than seven square inches or be no greater than
two inches across the smallest dimension.
(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards.
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in § 66A-4G(1) are conveyed through any device
(e.g., end-of-pipe netting facility, manufactured treatment
device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed, at a
minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
[a] A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches
wide (This option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities.); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inch.
§ 66A-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 66A-4
1:589
[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has

[4] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
historic property listed on the New Jersey Register.
(4) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in § 66A-4F and G
shall meet one of the following requirements:
(a) Be dedicated to a government agency as approved by the

(5) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 66A-7 or found on the Department's website
at www.njstormwater.org.
F. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at § 66A-5, either:
§ 66A-4 HO-HO-KUS CODE § 66A-4
1:590
[a] Demonstrate, through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain 100% of the average annual
preconstruction groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate, through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, that the increase of stormwater runoff
volume from preconstruction to post construction for
the two-year storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the urban redevelopment area or to
projects subject to § 66A-4F(1)(b)[3] below.
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading.
"High pollutant loading areas" are areas in industrial
and commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or
applied; areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than reportable
quantities, as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with a Department-approved remedial action work
plan or landfill closure plan; and areas with high risks
for spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
downgradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 66A-5, complete one of the
following:
[1] Demonstrate, through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis,
that for stormwater leaving the site, post-construction
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten-, and one-hundred-
§ 66A-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 66A-4
1:591
year storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
[2] Demonstrate, through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis,
that there is no increase, as compared to the
preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten-, and onehundred-
year storm events, and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
and projected land uses assuming full development under
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage
area;
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
post-construction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten- and
one-hundred-year storm events are 50%, 75% and 80%,
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the post-construction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
site on which the proposed development or project is to be
constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to postconstruction
stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or
[4] In tidal flood hazard areas, a stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with § 66A-4F(1)(c)[1], [2] and [3]
above shall only be applied if the increased volume of
stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the
point of discharge.
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of "major development" at § 66A-2 shall be submitted to
the appropriate Soil Conservation District for review and approval
in accordance with the requirements of this section and any
applicable Soil Conservation District guidelines for stormwater
runoff quantity and erosion control.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
post-construction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in
stormwater runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the
developed site, expressed as an annual average. Stormwater
management measures shall only be required for water quality
control if an additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being
proposed on a development site. The requirement to reduce TSS
does not apply to any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated
§ 66A-4 HO-HO-KUS CODE § 66A-4
1:592
under a numeric effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New
Jersey Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules,
N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in a discharge specifically exempt under a
NJPDES permit from this requirement. The water quality design
storm is 1.25 inches of rainfall in two hours. Water quality
calculations shall take into account the distribution of rain from the
water quality design storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation
of the volume of runoff may take into account the implementation
of nonstructural and structural stormwater management measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 66A-7 or found on the Department's website
at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other sources of
technical guidance are listed in § 66A-7. TSS reduction shall be
calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2
below. Alternative removal rates and methods of calculating
removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides
documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative
rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any approved
alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be
provided to the Department at the following address: Division of
Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, P.O. Box 418, Trenton, New Jersey 08625-0418.
§ 66A-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 66A-4

Best Management Practice TSS Percent Removal Rate
Bioretention systems 90%
Constructed stormwater
wetland
90%
Extended detention basin 40% to 60%
Infiltration structure 80%
Manufactured treatment device See § 66A-6C
Sand filter 80%
Vegetative filter strip 60% to 80%
Wet pond 50% to 90%
(3) If more than one BMP in a series is necessary to achieve the
required eighty-percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall
utilize the following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A + B - (A x B)/100
Where:
R = Total TSS percent load removal from application of both
BMPs.
A = The TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first
BMP.
B = The TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second
BMP.
(4) If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the eighty-percent
TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the
runoff from the subareas converge on site, in which case the
removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a
weighted average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the post-construction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in § 66A-4F and G.
(6) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, which may
be obtained from the address identified in § 66A-7 of this article.

(7) In accordance with the definition of "FW1" at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
(8) Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated as Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and
perennial or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the
Category One waters as shown on the USGS quadrangle maps or in
the county soil surveys, within the associated HUC 14 drainage
area. These areas shall be established for the protection of water
quality, aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance,
exceptional recreational significance, exceptional water supply
significance, and exceptional fisheries significance of those
established Category One waters. These areas shall be designated
and protected as follows:
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A three-hundred-foot special water resource protection
area shall be provided on each side of the waterway,
measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of
the bank outwards or from the center line of the waterway
where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing
vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural
succession.
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under § 66A-4G(8)(a)[1] above
shall only be allowed where previous development or
disturbance has occurred (for example, active agricultural
use, parking area or maintained lawn area). The
encroachment shall only be allowed where the applicant
demonstrates that the functional value and overall
condition of the special water resource protection area will
be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no
case shall the remaining special water resource protection
area be reduced to less than 150 feet, as measured
perpendicular to the top of bank of the waterway or center
line of the waterway where the bank is undefined. All
encroachments proposed under this subsection shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(b) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the standard for off-site stability in the Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under
the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et
seq.

(c) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
standard for off-site stability in the Standards for Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under the Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq.,
then the stabilization measures in accordance with the
requirements of the above standards may be placed within the
special water resource protection area, provided that:
[1] Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150 feet
of the Category One waterway;
[2] Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
section shall achieve a ninety-five-percent TSS postconstruction
removal rate;
[3] Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
[4] The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable;
[5] A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate Department staff and Soil Conservation
District staff to identify necessary stabilization measures;
and
[6] All encroachments proposed under this section shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(d) A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan, or by a
municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to § 66A-4G(8) has been approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection, then the provisions
of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource
protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream
corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to § 66A-4G(8)
shall maintain or enhance the current functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection area
as defined in § 66A-4G(8)(a)[1] above. In no case shall a stream
corridor protection plan allow the reduction of the special
water resource protection area to less than 150 feet, as
measured perpendicular to the waterway subject to this
subsection.

§ 66A-5. Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater
recharge.
(e) Section 66A-4G(8) does not apply to the construction of one
individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Section 4, Hydrology, and
Technical Release 55 (or superseding document), Urban
Hydrology for Small Watersheds; or
(b) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition
of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at § 66A-5A(1)(a) and the Rational and
Modified Rational Methods at § 66A-5A(1)(b). A runoff coefficient
or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing condition may
be used on all or a portion of the site if the design engineer verifies
that the hydrologic condition has existed on the site or portion of
the site for at least five years without interruption prior to the time
of application. If more than one land cover has existed on the site
during the five years immediately prior to the time of application,
the land cover with the lowest runoff potential shall be used for the
computations. In addition, there is the presumption that the site is
in good hydrologic condition (if the land use type is pasture, lawn,
or park), with good cover (if the land use type is woods), or with
good hydrologic condition and conservation treatment (if the land
use type is cultivation).
(3) In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or
culverts, that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
§ 66A-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 66A-5
1:597
§ 66A-6. Standards for structural stormwater management
measures.
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55 (or superseding document), Urban
Hydrology for Small Watersheds, and other methods may be
employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater
management measures. Notwithstanding the preceding, where
tailwater will affect the hydraulic performance of a stormwater
management measure, the design engineer shall include such
effects in the measure's design.
B. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
following:
(1) The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32, A Method for
Evaluating Ground-Water Recharge Areas in New Jersey,
incorporated herein by reference, as amended and supplemented.
Information regarding the methodology is available from the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual; at
http://www.state.nj.us/dep/njgs/; or at New Jersey Geological
Survey, 29 Arctic Parkway, P.O. Box 427, Trenton, New Jersey
08625-0427; (609) 984-6587.
A. Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as
follows:
(1) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
take into account the existing site conditions, including, for
example, environmentally critical areas; wetlands; flood-prone
areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high water table; soil type,
permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage patterns; and
the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone).
(2) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and
ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the
intake to the outlet structure, as appropriate, and shall have
parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars to the
elevation of the water quality design storm. For elevations higher
than the water quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet
structure shall be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the
diameter of the orifice or 1/3 the width of the weir, with a minimum
§ 66A-5 HO-HO-KUS CODE § 66A-6
1:598
§ 66A-6.1. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
spacing between bars of one inch and a maximum spacing between
bars of six inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must
comply with the requirements of § 66A-8D.
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosion
resistant. Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions
of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3,
5:21-7.4, and 5:21-7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
(4) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin,
the orifice size shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 inches in diameter.
(5) Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins at
§ 66A-8.
B. Stormwater management measure guidelines are available in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. Other
stormwater management measures may be utilized, provided the
design engineer demonstrates that the proposed measure and its
design will accomplish the required water quantity, groundwater
recharge and water quality design and performance standards
established by § 66A-4 of this article.
C. Manufactured treatment devices may be used to meet the requirements
of § 66A-4 of this article, provided the pollutant removal rates are
verified by the New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology and
certified by the Department.
A. Buffers. Buffer areas are required along all lot and street lines
separating residential uses from arterial and collector streets,
separating a nonresidential use from either a residential use or
residential zoning district line, and along all street lines where loading
and storage areas can be seen from the street. The buffer area shall use
native vegetation, which requires less fertilization and watering than
non-native species. Buffer areas may be used for stormwater
management by disconnecting impervious surfaces and treating runoff
from these impervious surfaces. Preservation of natural wood tracts
and limiting land disturbance for new construction must be
incorporated where practical.
B. Curbs and gutters. Curb cuts or flush curbs with curb stops are
encouraged where practical to allow vegetated swales to be used for
stormwater conveyance and to allow the disconnection of impervious
areas where practical.
C. Drainage systems. Chapter 32B of the Ho-Ho-Kus Code may require
that all streets be provided with inlets and pipes where the same are
§ 66A-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 66A-6.1
1:599
necessary for proper drainage. The use of natural vegetated swales in
lieu of inlets and pipes are encouraged where practical.
D. Driveways and accessways. The use of pervious paving materials to
minimize stormwater runoff and promote groundwater recharge should
be considered for driveways and accessways where practical.
Consideration should be given for subsurface soil conditions. The use of
crowned driveways is also encouraged to promote disconnectivity
between impervious surfaces and grass areas to promote groundwater
recharge.
E. Natural features. Natural features, such as trees, brooks, swamps,
hilltops, and views, are to be preserved whenever possible, and care
shall be taken to preserve selected trees to enhance soil stability and
landscaped treatment of the area. In addition, forested areas shall be
maintained to ensure that leaf litter and other beneficial aspects of the
forest are maintained in addition to the trees.
F. Off-site and off-tract improvements. Any off-site and off-tract
stormwater management and drainage improvements must conform to
the design and performance standards described.
G. Off-street parking and loading. Parking lots with more than 10 spaces
and all loading areas should allow for flush curb with curb stop or
curbing with curb cuts to encourage developers to allow for the
discharge of impervious areas into landscaped areas for stormwater
management. The use of natural vegetated swales for the water quality
design storm, with overflow for larger storm events into storm sewers,
should be utilized where practical. A developer may demonstrate that
fewer spaces would be required, provided area is set aside for
additional spaces if necessary. Pervious paving could be provided
overflow parking areas.
H. Performance standards. Pollution source control must be evaluated in
order to prohibit materials or wastes from being deposited upon a lot in
such form or manner that they can be transferred off the lot, directly or
indirectly, by natural forces such as precipitation, evaporation or wind.
Materials and wastes that might create a pollutant or a hazard shall be
enclosed in appropriate containers.
I. Shade trees. Chapter 32B of the Ho-Ho-Kus Code may require a
minimum of shade trees per lot to be planted in the front yard. This
article recognizes that the preservation of mature trees and forested
areas must be considered in the management of environmental
resources, particularly watershed management, air quality, and
ambient heating and cooling. Identification of forested areas and the
percentage of wooded areas to be protected from disturbance shall be
provided.
J. Sidewalks. Sidewalks should be designed to discharge stormwater to
neighboring lawns where feasible to disconnect these impervious
surfaces or use permeable paving materials where appropriate.

§ 66A-7. Sources for technical guidance.
§ 66A-8. Safety standards for stormwater management basins.
K. Soil erosion and sediment control. The applicant shall comply with the
New Jersey Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Standards and should
incorporate signs to retain and protect natural vegetation; minimize
and retain water runoff to facilitate groundwater recharge; and install
diversions, sediment basins, and similar required structures prior to
any on-site grading or disturbance.

1:601
A. This section sets forth requirements to protect public safety through
the proper design and operation of stormwater management basins.
This section applies to any new stormwater management basin. The
provisions of this section do not preempt more stringent municipal or
county safety requirements for new or existing stormwater
management basins. Municipal and county stormwater management
plans and ordinances may, pursuant to their authority, require existing
stormwater management basins to be retrofitted to meet one or more of
the safety standards in § 66A-8B(1), (2) and (3) for trash racks, overflow
grates, and escape provisions at outlet structures.
B. Requirements for trash racks, overflow grates and escape provisions.
(1) A trash rack is a device designed to catch trash and debris and
prevent the clogging of outlet structures. Trash racks shall be
installed at the intake to the outlet from the stormwater
management basin to ensure proper functioning of the basin
outlets in accordance with the following:
(a) The trash rack shall have parallel bars, with no greater than
six-inch spacing between the bars.
(b) The trash rack shall be designed so as not to adversely affect
the hydraulic performance of the outlet pipe or structure.
(c) The average velocity of flow through a clean trash rack is not to
exceed 2.5 feet per second under the full range of stage and
discharge. Velocity is to be computed on the basis of the net
area of opening through the rack.
(d) The trash rack shall be constructed and installed to be rigid,
durable, and corrosion resistant and shall be designed to
withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300 pounds per
square foot.
(2) An overflow grate is designed to prevent obstruction of the
overflow structure. If an outlet structure has an overflow grate,
such grate shall meet the following requirements:
(a) The overflow grate shall be secured to the outlet structure but
removable for emergencies and maintenance.
(b) The overflow grate spacing shall be no less than two inches
across the smallest dimension.
(c) The overflow grate shall be constructed and installed to be
rigid, durable, and corrosion resistant and shall be designed to
withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300 pounds per
square foot.
(3) For purposes of this § 66A-8B(3), "escape provisions" means the
permanent installation of ladders, steps, rungs, or other features
that provide easily accessible means of egress from stormwater
§ 66A-8 HO-HO-KUS CODE § 66A-8
1:602
management basins. Stormwater management basins shall include
escape provisions as follows:
(a) If a stormwater management basin has an outlet structure,
escape provisions shall be incorporated in or on the structure.
With the prior approval of the reviewing agency identified in
§ 66A-8C, a freestanding outlet structure may be exempted
from this requirement.
(b) Safety ledges shall be constructed on the slopes of all new
stormwater management basins having a permanent pool of
water deeper than 2 1/2 feet. Such safety ledges shall be
comprised of two steps. Each step shall be four feet to six feet
in width. One step shall be located approximately 2 1/2 feet
below the permanent water surface, and the second step shall
be located one to 1 1/2 feet above the permanent water
surface. See § 66A-8D for an illustration of safety ledges in a
stormwater management basin.
(c) In new stormwater management basins, the maximum interior
slope for an earthen dam, embankment, or berm shall not be
steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.
C. Variance or exemption from safety standards. A variance or exemption
from the safety standards for stormwater management basins may be
granted only upon a written finding by the appropriate reviewing
agency (municipality, county or Department) that the variance or
exemption will not constitute a threat to public safety.
D. Illustration of safety ledges in a new stormwater management basin.

taken, equipment used and manpower requirements to
complete the recovery process in the safest manner and

equipment and manpower recovery, the contracted service
§ 75-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 75-10
1:643
§ 75-11. Miscellaneous provisions.

C. The Borough reserves the right to make periodic unannounced
inspections of the personnel, vehicles, equipment and storage areas of
all official towers.
D. The relationship between an official tower and the Borough is one of an
independent contractor. Neither party shall be construed in any manner
whatsoever to be an employee of the other, nor shall any employee or
agent furnished by any party be construed to be an employee or agent
of the other party. Inclusion on the official towers list shall not be
construed or considered as a joint venture, partnership, association,
contract of employment or profit-sharing agreement.

regulations concerning wages, hours and terms of employment.

to a motor vehicle while in custody of the tower, written notice of same
shall be provided by the Borough Administrator to the official tower
involved. The tower shall have the opportunity to respond, in writing,
within seven days.
B. Within 14 days of receipt of the tower's response, or within 21 days of
receipt of the complaint if no response is received, the matter shall be
presented by the Borough Administrator to the Mayor and Council.
C. The Mayor and Council shall thereafter consider the matter at the
regular public meeting and may request that the complainant and the
tower involved appear and give testimony regarding the complaint.
D. After considering the matter and the evidence presented, the Mayor
and Council shall make certain findings and conclusions relative to the
complaint, which shall constitute its decision. If the Council finds in
favor of the complainant and against the official tower, the Council may
consider and impose the following penalties:
(1) Suspension of the official tower's license;
(2) Revocation of such license for a fixed period or duration;
(3) Permanent revocation of the official tower's license;

into account factors, including, but not limited to, any prior
violations of the tower, the nature and seriousness of the complaint,
and the danger to the health, safety and welfare of the public.
E. Failure to surrender the license upon revocation shall constitute a
violation of this chapter.
F. Nothing contained herein shall prevent or limit the right of any person
to commence or maintain an action for damages or any other relief
directly against an official tower in a court of competent jurisdiction.

techniques and monetary losses that may result therefrom; that such
transient merchants often conduct business in violation of local zoning

§ 77-1. Establishment; composition; procedures.
§ 77-2. Examination and approval of permits; expiration and
cancellation.
A. Pursuant to P.L. 1975, c. 217, known as the "Uniform Construction Code
Act of the State of New Jersey" (hereinafter referred to as "the Act"),146
there is hereby established in the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus a State
Uniform Construction Code enforcing agency to be known as the
"Uniform Construction Code Department of the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus,"
consisting of a Construction Official, Building Subcode Official,
Plumbing Subcode Official, Electrical Subcode Official and Fire
Protection Subcode Official. The Construction Official shall be the chief
administrator of the enforcing agency. He shall have the power to
overrule a determination of a subcode official, based on an
interpretation of a substantive provision of the subcode which such
subcode official administers, only if the Construction Official is qualified
to act, pursuant to the Act, as a subcode official for such subcode. He
may serve as a subcode official for any subcode which he is qualified
under the Act to administer. A subcode official or Municipal Engineer
may serve as a Construction Official if otherwise qualified under the
provisions of the Act. The Plumbing Subcode Official shall be the
Plumbing Inspector as appointed by the Board of Health of the Borough
of Ho-Ho-Kus. Subcode officials or assistance staff may be employed on
a part-time basis or hold other positions within the Borough of Ho-Ho-
Kus.
B. Each official position created in Subsection A hereof shall be filled by a
person qualified for such position pursuant to P.L. 1975, c. 217, as
amended, and N.J.A.C. 5:23, provided that, in lieu of any particular
subcode official, an on-site inspection agency may be retained by
contract pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:23. More than one such official position
may be held by the same person, provided that such person is qualified
pursuant to P.L. 1975, c. 217, and N.J.A.C. 5:23 to hold each such
position.
C. The public shall have the right to do business with the Uniform
Construction Code Department of the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus at its
offices located in the Borough Hall, except for emergencies and
unforeseen or unavoidable circumstances.
A. The enforcing agency shall examine each application for a construction
permit. If the application conforms with the Act, the code and the
requirements of other applicable laws and ordinances, it shall be
deemed a completed application, and the enforcing agency shall
approve the application and shall issue a construction permit to the

applicant. Every completed application for a construction permit shall
be granted, in whole or in part, or denied within 20 business days. If
a completed application is denied, in whole or in part, the enforcing
agency shall set forth the reasons therefor in writing. If an enforcing
agency fails to grant, in whole or in part, or deny a completed
application for a construction permit within the period of time
prescribed herein, such failure shall be deemed a denial of the
application for purposes of an appeal to the Construction Board of
Appeals, unless such period of time has been extended with the consent
of the applicant. The enforcing agency may approve changes in plans
and specifications previously approved by it, if the plans and
specifications when so changed remain in conformity with law.
B. A construction permit, issued in accordance with the foregoing
provisions, pursuant to which no construction has been undertaken
above the foundation walls within one year from the time of issuance
shall expire. The enforcing agency may suspend, revoke or cancel a
construction permit in case of neglect or failure to comply with the
provisions of this Act or the code or upon a finding by it that a false
statement or representation has been made in the application for the
construction permit.
C. The enforcing agency shall have all other powers as enumerated in the
Act.

§ 79-13. Fees for parking.
It is hereby determined and stated that the parking of vehicles in the
parking lots provided and maintained by the Borough shall be limited and
regulated by the imposition of fees for the privilege of parking thereon, to
be determined by the length of time for which a vehicle may be parked,
except as otherwise herein provided. Such parking fees shall be payable in
advance, except as herein otherwise provided. Such fees are to be collected
through parking meters installed in said parking lots, or by the purchase of
permits as herein provided.
§ 79-14. Parking meter spaces.
The area available for the parking of vehicles in every parking lot
maintained by the Borough shall be suitably subdivided into parking meter
spaces. Every vehicle using such lots shall be parked head-in and entirely
within the parking meter space. Any vehicle not parked head-in or in such a
position so as to be entirely within the parking meter space or in any area
not designated as a parking meter space shall be deemed to be in violation
of this article.
§ 79-15. Operation of parking meters.
Except in a period of emergency determined by an officer of the Police
Department, or in compliance with the directions of a police officer or traffic
control sign or signal, or except as otherwise herein provided, when any
vehicle shall be parked in a parking meter space, the operator of such
vehicle shall, upon entering the said parking meter space, immediately
deposit or cause to be deposited in such meter such proper coin of the
United States of America hereinafter referred to as "coin or coins," as is
required for such parking meter, and as is designated by the directions of
the meter, and by this article, and after the deposit of the proper coin or
coins, shall also set in operation the timing mechanism on such meter in
accordance with the directions thereon; and the failure to deposit such coin
or coins and to set the timing mechanism in operation when so required
shall constitute a violation of this article. Upon the deposit of such coin or
coins and the setting of the timing mechanism in operation, the parking
meter space may be lawfully occupied by such vehicle for the period of
time prescribed for such parking meter space for the payment made by
such person. Should any person place a vehicle in a parking meter space
which indicates that unused time has been left in the meter by the previous
occupant of the space, such person shall not be required to deposit a coin so
long as his occupancy of such space does not exceed the indicated unused
parking time. If any vehicle shall remain in any parking meter space beyond
the unused time limit left in such meter or the time paid for, and such meter
shall indicate such illegal parking, then such vehicle shall be considered to
be parked overtime and in violation of this article.

customer, and a record of such tests will be kept. [Amended
1-23-1990 by Ord. No. 651; 3-25-2003 by Ord. No. 865]
B. (Reserved)163
C. No water meter shall be placed in service if on test it registers more
than 103% of the water passed or less than 97% of full capacity.
D. In case of a disputed account involving a question as to the accuracy of
a meter, such meter will be tested upon the request of the customer,
unless there has been an obvious waste of water by accident or neglect
of plumbing. In the event that the meter so tested is found to have an
error in the registration in excess of 3%, the bills will be corrected
accordingly.
E. When water is furnished by meter, the quantity recorded by it shall be
taken to be the amount passing the meter, except where the meter has
been found to be registering inaccurately or has ceased to register. In
such cases, the quantity may be determined by the average registration
of the meter when in order or by such fair and reasonable method as
shall be based upon the best information obtainable. Where excessive
leakage involving loss of water over $10 has been found, adjustment
may be made. [Amended 1-23-1990 by Ord. No. 651]
A. Bills for service and water shall be rendered quarterly and shall show
the readings of the meter at the beginning and end of the period for
which the bill is rendered. [Amended 1-23-1990 by Ord. No. 651]
B. When a bill is rendered a second time covering a period for which a bill
has been rendered, the period shall be clearly stated on the bill.
C. Where access to meters cannot be had, the Registrar may bill the
amount charged for the corresponding quarter of the preceding year or
for the period corresponding to that for which access is impossible, and,
in such cases, the amount paid will be treated as credit, the amount due
being determined by the next meter reading. Estimated bills rendered
under this clause shall indicate the fact that the same are estimated.
The Registrar may also use this procedure of billing on alternative
quarters as may be determined by the Water Committee. At no time
may a customer be estimated more than two quarters in a row. Where a
reading cannot be obtained for the third quarter, water will be
discontinued until such reading is provided. [Amended 1-23-1990 by
Ord. No. 651]

herein within 30 days after the bill is rendered will be required to pay,
in addition thereto, a penalty of 10%. In case any water rent or rents

under such conditions, it will remain off until the amount owing is paid
in full with interest and turnoff charges or until arrangements for
payment satisfactory to the Registrar have been made. If necessary to
call at the premises after such seven-day notice, a charge will be made
to cover the cost of the call, the amount of which shall be fixed by the
Borough Council. [Amended 1-23-1990 by Ord. No. 651]
C. The owner or owners of any store, house, building, buildings or
premises shall be and are liable for the payment of the water supply,
service charge and interest charges. The failure to pay for such water
supply, service charge and interest charges shall constitute and become
a lien upon such store, house, building, buildings or premises until such
charges shall have been paid and satisfied, and the Borough Council
may direct said premises to be sold to satisfy such lien, in the manner as
provided for by law.
D. Customers desiring the discontinuance of water supply shall give
written notice thereof, of at least five days, to the Water Registrar,
which notice must state whether the discontinuance is to be temporary,
or more or less permanent Until such notice is received by the Water
Registrar, water shall be charged for at the prescribed rate. For a
temporarily discontinued water supply where the meter remains on the
customer's premises or for a more or less permanent discontinuance
where the meter is removed from the customer's premises, a charge
shall be made against and be paid for by the customer, the amount of
which shall be fixed by the Borough Council.

emergency exists in the municipality in accordance with § 81-30 of this
article, all citizens shall be urged to observe voluntary indoor conservation
measures, and any of the following water use restrictions shall be imposed
and shall be applicable to all residents and tenants, except where a bona
fide health emergency exists and to exempt businesses, as specified herein,
during the water emergency.
A. Whenever the governing body shall be satisfied and finds that a water
emergency exists in the municipality, it may adopt a resolution
declaring that a water emergency exists in the municipality. Such
resolution shall be adopted by the governing body at any regular,
special, adjourned or emergency public meeting of the governing body.
Such resolution shall identify that portion of the municipality affected
by the water emergency, which may include the entire municipality and
shall specify which of the water use regulations contained in § 81-31 of
this article is being imposed as well as any exemptions as may be
authorized. Such resolution shall be effective immediately upon
publication according to law and shall continue in effect for 90 days,
unless extended or repealed as set forth in § 81-32 of this article.
B. For the purpose of this section, a water emergency shall exist if, for any
of the following reasons:
(1) The Water Department providing water service to all or a portion of
the municipality has notified the municipality, the New Jersey
Board of Public Utilities and the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection, as well as any other state, county of
local agency entitled to notice that an emergency exists, and has
recommended such restrictions for handling the emergency; or

emergency. At the expiration of the time period specified in the resolution,
the water use restriction shall lapse and be inapplicable and unenforceable.
If the governing body shall be satisfied that the water emergency has been
abated prior to the expiration of the time period specified in the resolution,
it shall adopt a resolution declaring the water emergency ended and the

resolution required by § 81-30 of this article which is reasonable under
the circumstances considering the nature and extent of the water

be limited in application to that portion of the municipality, which may
include the entire municipality, identified as being affected by the water
emergency in the resolution of the governing body adopted in
accordance with § 81-30 of this article.

Title and Purpose
§ 85-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and cited as the "Zoning Ordinance of the
Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus."
§ 85-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish a pattern for the use of land
based upon the Comprehensive Master Plan for the Borough of Ho-Ho-
Kus. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter
shall be held to be minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the
public health, safety, morals and general welfare. Among other purposes,
such provisions are intended to secure safety from fire, flood, panic and
other natural and man-made disasters; to provide adequate light, air and
open space; to ensure that development does not conflict with the
development and general welfare of neighboring municipalities; to avoid
undue concentrations of population by regulation and limiting of use of
land and the height and bulk of buildings wherever erected; to promote
a desirable visual environment through reasonable civic design and
arrangements; to promote the conservation of open space and valuable
natural resources and to prevent urban sprawl and degradation of the
environment through improper or unreasonable use of land; to regulate and
restrict the location, construction and use of buildings, structures and the
use of land; to regulate and determine the area and dimensions of yards
and other open spaces for buildings hereafter erected; and to divide the
Borough into districts, with a view to conserving the value of property and
encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the Borough of
Ho-Ho-Kus. This chapter establishes a Comprehensive Zoning Plan and Map
for the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus and implements the Land Use Element of the
Ho-Ho-Kus Master Plan, repealing Chapter 86, Zoning, of the Code of the
Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus, as amended and supplemented.
§ 85-3. Scope.
It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way
impair or interfere with existing provisions of other laws or ordinances.
Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings
or premises or upon the height of buildings or premises or lot coverage or
requires greater lot area or larger yards, courts or other open spaces than
are imposed or required by such existing provisions of law or ordinance or
by such rules, regulations or permits or by such private restrictions, the
provisions of this chapter shall control.

§ 85-13.1. Downtown Inclusionary Overlay Residential/Mixed-Use
Zones 1 Through 4. [Added 7-25-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-10]
Review. Such site plan shall be required for all new construction,
conversions and changes in type or use.
A. Purpose. To address its affordable housing unmet need obligation, the
Borough shall implement an Inclusionary Overlay Zone Ordinance that
creates a realistic opportunity for housing in the Borough's downtown
that is affordable to low- and moderate-income households. This
chapter establishes the Downtown Inclusionary Overlay Zone and
permits the creation of multifamily housing within the downtown area
(as outlined in the appended maps),177 provided that such housing
complies with a required twenty-percent inclusionary set-aside
requirement and with the requirements of this chapter.
B. Area affected. The Downtown Inclusionary Overlay Zone is comprised
of four subzones shown on the maps in the appendix to this code.178
Overlays 1 and 2 (OL-1 and OL-2) comprise the blocks and lots
surrounding North Maple Avenue and Sheridan Avenue. Overlay 3
(OL-3) includes commercial lots fronting on Franklin Turnpike,
Sycamore Avenue, and Warren Avenue, and Overlay 4 (OL-4) includes
the first three lots north of Warren Avenue, between Sycamore Avenue
and Sheridan Avenue.
C. Special rules. Inclusionary multifamily development is permitted in
each OL overlay zone, conditioned on compliance with this chapter and
the following limitations:
(1) Where a property in the OL-1, OL-2, or OL-3 Zone is to be
developed with a multifamily inclusionary residential use and the
underlying zone is GB General Business, residential uses are
restricted to the upper stories of a building and the ground-story
use shall be a nonresidential use.
(2) Where multifamily inclusionary development is to occur on a
property in the OL-1 or OL-3 Zone, and the underlying zone is an
R-2 or R-4 Residential Zone, nonresidential uses are prohibited
from occurring on the same property.
(3) Where multifamily inclusionary development is to occur on a
property in the OL-4 Zone, such property may be developed for and
contain a mix of multifamily residential use and public use.
(4) In any multifamily inclusionary development permitted by this
section, at least 20% of the residential units must be affordable to
low- and moderate-income households. In the event that 20% of the
total number of residential units does not result in a full integer, the
177. Editor's Note: Said maps are on file in the Borough offices.
178. Editor's Note: Said maps are on file in the Borough offices.
§ 85-13 HO-HO-KUS CODE § 85-13.1
1:778
developer/property owner shall refer to § 2-3C with regard to
addressing the fractional unit. [Amended 3-27-2018 by Ord. No.
2018-03]
(a) The developer/property owner may round the fractional
number of units upward to provide one additional whole unit;
or
(b) The developer/property owner provides the whole number of
units resulting from the twenty-percent set-aside on the full
unit count of the development and pays a six-percent
affordable housing development fee on the number of the
balance of the total units at the site that do not generate a
whole affordable housing unit from a twenty-percent set-aside.
The number of market rate units subject to the six-percent
development fee will be calculated as follows: Total no. of units
- (Affordable units to be constructed x 5) = No. of market rate
units subject to dev. fee.
(c) Examples:
[1] If there are four total units at a site, at least one must be
affordable or the developer must provide a development of
6% on each of the four market rate units, because four
total units do not generate one full affordable housing unit
based on the 20% set-aside requirement. Units subject to
six-percent development fee: 4 units - (0 affordable units x
5) = 4 market rate units subject to dev. fee.
[2] If there are 18 total units, the developer must create four
affordable units or create three affordable units and pay a
fee of 6% on three units that do not generate one whole
affordable housing unit based on the twenty-percent setaside
requirement. Units subject to 6% development fee:
18 units - (3 affordable units x 5) =
= 18 units - 15 units
= 3 market-rate units subject to development fee
(d) The amount of the development fee shall be determined by the
Borough prior to the issuance of a building permit and shall be
imposed as a condition of development approval.
(e) In any multifamily development having five or more residential
units, at least one unit must be established as affordable to
low- and moderate-income households.
(5) All affordable units produced in an overlay district must comply
with the Borough's Affordable Housing Ordinance at Chapter 2 of
the Borough Code.
§ 85-13.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 85-13.1
1:779
(6) The effects and requirements of this chapter shall supersede the
requirements of the Borough-wide mandatory set-aside at § 2-3.
D. Permitted principal uses in the Downtown Overlay District shall be
limited to the following:
(1) All uses permitted by the underlying zoning, except that:
(a) Where the GB District is the underlying zoning, only those uses
permitted in the GB District by § 85-13A(2) through (10), (15)
and (16) are permitted as the ground-story uses in any mixeduse,
multifamily inclusionary development.
(b) Uses permitted by § 85-13A(11) through (14) are permitted as
stand-alone uses and are not subject to any other conditions of
the overlay zone ordinance. However, if a use permitted by
§ 85-13A(11) qualifies as an eligible affordable housing credit,
then such use may be permitted as an upper-story use.
(2) A multifamily inclusionary residential use is permitted, conditioned
on compliance with § 85-13.1C, Special rules, in this chapter.
(3) In the OL-4 Overlay Zone, the following uses are permitted
individually or as mixed-use, provided that compliance with the
density and building height requirements for the OL-4 Zone are
observed and each use has separate building entrances and
parking areas.
(a) Municipal government uses; and
(b) Inclusionary, multifamily residential uses.
E. Accessory buildings, structures and uses shall be permitted when used

dining/cafes, in this chapter.
(10) Other customary accessory uses and structures which are clearly
incidental to the principal structures and uses.
F. Prohibited uses.
(1) Where inclusionary multifamily uses are permitted by this chapter,
nonresidential uses are prohibited on a second or third story.
However, where a mixed-use development is permitted by this
chapter with a ground-floor nonresidential use, an office, utility
room, or storage room associated with a ground-story
nonresidential use in a three-story building may occupy not more
than one-fifth (20%) of the gross floor area of the second story,
provided that it is not accessed by any hall or stairway shared with
residential uses in the same building.
(2) Where the underlying zoning is GB, residential uses are prohibited
from occupying the ground story.
(3) Except in the OL-4 Zone, where the underlying zoning is R-2 or R-4,
nonresidential uses are prohibited.
G. Bulk standards.

the following standards for any new multifamily development,
provided that it conforms to the inclusionary set-aside standards of
this chapter, as follows:
(a) Maximum improved lot coverage: 60%.
(b) Maximum lot coverage: 40%.
(c) Minimum open space requirements of the R-2 and R-4 Zones
do not apply.
(d) Front yard setback: 15 feet.

record. The owner of the shared parking area shall enter
into a written developer's agreement with the Borough
with enforcement running to the Borough providing that
the land comprising the parking area shall never be
disposed of except in conjunction with the sale of the
building which the parking area serves so long as the
facilities are required and that the owner agrees to bear
the expense of recording the agreement and such
agreement shall bind his or her heirs, successors, and
assigns. An attested copy of the agreement between the
owners of record shall be submitted to the administrative
officer for recordation in a form established by the
Borough attorney. Recordation of the agreement must take
place before issuance of a building permit or certificate of
occupancy for any use to be served by the shared parking
area. A shared parking agreement may be revoked only if
all required off-street parking spaces will be provided on
site in accordance with the off-street parking schedules in
this section. The written agreement shall be voided by the
Borough if other off-street facilities are provided in accord
with these zoning regulations.

variance or waiver relief for fewer parking spaces than
required by § 85-13.1H(1) and (2) above, a payment shall be
made to the Borough in the amount to be determined for each
parking space in which said relief has been granted.
[1] The fee required under this § 85-13.1H(3)(c) shall only
apply to new deficiencies in parking spaces resulting from
a change in use.
[2] An applicant is permitted to pay the fee in lieu of parking
for not more than half of its required parking.
[3] An applicant requesting to pay the fee in lieu of more than
half of its required parking must receive permission from
the Borough, based on a determination that the applicant
cannot provide adequate parking on or off site without
compromising the economic viability of the proposed
residential and nonresidential use and that there are no
available shared parking opportunities meeting the
requirements of this chapter.
[4] The said payment shall be deposited by the Borough into a
dedicated account designated as the "Borough of Ho-Ho-
Kus Parking Fund." The payment shall be due prior to
issuance of a building permit. Any funds deposited into
said account shall be utilized by the Borough for the
express purpose of installing, replacing or repairing

§ 85-13.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 85-13.1
1:787
In an effort to ensure a visually attractive environment, new
buildings and reconstructions are encouraged to incorporate such
building elements as recessed or extended entrances, enhanced
corner treatments, graphic panels, display windows, and vertical
and horizontal articulations, as detailed below. The following
design and related streetscape standards are to be addressed as
part of all development applications in the Overlay Zones.
(2) Goals of design standards.
(a) To provide designs that complement the historic developed
character of the downtown and its surrounding neighborhoods,
through appropriate massing, scale, use of building materials
and original architectural details, and fenestration.
(b) To provide multistory buildings to be designed with horizontal
and vertical articulation to facilitate an enhanced visual
interest in the neighborhood's architecture and discourage
buildings that are characterized by nondescript blank walls.
(c) To provide the use of such building materials as brick, wood,
native stone and clapboard to ensure complementary visual
interest such as is found in the neighborhood and discourage
use of vinyl, cement block and aluminum.

facades that are characterized by substantial window areas as
a total proportion of the first-story elevation to maximize
visibility of store interiors and thereby enhance visual interest
for pedestrian experiences.
(3) Building design elements.
(a) Facade design.
[1] Horizontal articulation between floors. Each facade should
be designed to have a delineated floor line between street
level and upper floors. This delineation can be in the form
of a masonry belt course, a concrete lintel or a cornice line
delineated by wood detailing.
[2] Vertical articulation. Each building facade facing a public
right-of-way must have elements of vertical articulation
comprised of columns, piers, recessed windows or entry
designs, overhangs, ornamental projection of the molding,
different exterior materials or wall colors, or recessed
portions of the main surface of the wall itself. The vertical
articulations shall be designed in accordance with the
following:

clear window glass. This percentage shall be calculated within
the area of the building facade that is located between three
feet and 10 feet above sidewalk level.
(b) A minimum of 40% of the front entrance of retail development
shall consist of glass in order to maximize the visibility of store
interiors.
(c) Materials. Exterior building materials shall be classified as
either primary, secondary or accent materials. The facade shall
be designed in accordance with the following:
[1] The primary material shall cover at least 60% of the facade
of the building.
[2] Secondary materials shall cover not more than 40% of the
facade.
(5) Rooflines/building height.

(b) The rooflines of at least 30% of the number of units attached in
a structure are to be staggered in height by not less than 2.5
feet of the height of the rooflines of the other units in such
structures and/or by other features which will provide relief or
articulation to the roofline.
(9) Streetscape design. All properties shall comply with the following
requirements:
(a) Where buildings are set back from the street 10 feet or more, a
landscaped area with a minimum width of five feet shall be
provided.

impacts of towers and antennas;
(b) Require the location of towers in nonresidential zones;
(c) Minimize the total number of towers throughout the
community;
(d) Require the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a
primary option rather than construction of additional singleuse
towers;
(e) Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the
extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the
community is minimal;
(f) Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a
way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and
antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening
and innovative camouflaging techniques;
(g) Enable the ability of the providers of telecommunications
services to provide such services to the community quickly,
effectively and efficiently;
(h) Consider the public health and safety of communication
towers, as appropriate; and
(i) Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower
failure through engineering and careful siting of tower
structures.
(2) In furtherance of these goals, the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus shall give
due consideration to the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus Master Plan,

existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation
of an antenna or tower on such lot.
(2) Lot size. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a
tower or antenna complies with zone development regulations,
including but not limited to setback requirements, lot coverage
requirements and other such requirements, the dimensions of the
entire lot shall control even though the antennas or towers may be
located on leased parcels within such lot. The minimum lot size for
new towers and antennas is 7,500 square feet.
(3) Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or
tower shall provide to the Borough Engineer an inventory of its
existing towers, antennas or sites approved for the towers or
antennas, as well as all sites where an application is pending, that
are either within the jurisdiction of the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus or
within five miles of the border thereof, including specific
information about the location, height and design of each tower.
The Borough Engineer may share such information with other
applicants applying for administrative approvals or permits under
this section or other organizations seeking to locate antennas
within the jurisdiction of the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus; provided,
however, that the Borough Engineer is not, by sharing such
information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites
are available or suitable.

(4) Aesthetics. Towers and antennas shall meet the following
requirements:
(a) Towers shall maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to
any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color
so as to reduce the visual obtrusiveness. Monopoles may
include a design commonly referred to as a "monopole tree" to
provide camouflaging.
(b) At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related
structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors,
textures, screening and landscaping that will blend them into
the natural setting and surrounding buildings.
(c) If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment
must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely
compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to
make the antenna and related equipment as visually
unobtrusive as possible.
(5) Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by
the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the
lighting alternatives and design chosen must cause the least
amount of disturbances to the surrounding views.
(6) State or federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed
current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any
other agency of the state or federal government with the authority
to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations
are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed
by this section shall bring such towers and antennas into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations within 120
days of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless
a different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling
state or federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall
constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the
owner's expense.
(7) Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity
of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in
compliance with standards contained in applicable state, local and
appropriate industry building codes. If, upon inspection, the
Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus concludes that a tower fails to comply with
such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or
property, then, upon notice being provided to the owner of the
tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into
compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into
compliance within said 30 days shall constitute grounds for the
removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense.
§ 85-39.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 85-39.1
1:841
(8) Measurement. For purposes of measurement, tower setbacks and
separation distances shall be calculated and applied to facilities
located in the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus irrespective of municipal and
county jurisdictional boundaries.
(9) Not essential services. Towers and antennas shall be regulated and
permitted pursuant to this section and shall not be regulated or
permitted as essential services, public utilities or private utilities,
unless mandated by federal or state law.
(10) Franchises. Owners and/or operators of towers or antennas shall
certify that all franchises required by law for the construction and/
or operation of a wireless communication system in the Borough of
Ho-Ho-Kus have been obtained and shall file a copy of all required
franchises with the Borough Engineer.
(11) Public notice and hearing. For purposes of this section, any
conditional use request, variance request or appeal of an
administratively approved use or conditional use shall require
public notice to all abutting property owners and all property
owners of properties that are located within the corresponding
separation distance listed in Subsection F(2)(e)[2], Table 2, in
addition to any notice otherwise required by this chapter. A public
hearing must be held before the Ho-Ho-Kus Planning Board for all
conditional use requests under this section.
(12) Signs. No signs or advertisements shall be allowed on an antenna
or tower.
(13) Buildings and support equipment. Buildings and support
equipment associated with antennas or towers shall comply with
the requirements of Subsection G.
(14) Multiple antenna/tower plan. The Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus
encourages the users of towers and antennas to submit a single
application for approval of multiple towers and/or antenna sites.
Applications for approval of multiple sites shall be given priority in
the review process.
(15) Height. The maximum height of new towers shall be 130 feet in
height.
E. Conditional and prohibited uses.

1:844
(b) Factors considered in granting conditional use permits for
towers. In addition to any standards for consideration of
conditional use permit applications pursuant to the Borough
Code, the Planning Board shall consider the following factors
in determining whether to issue a conditional use permit:
[1] Height of the proposed tower;
[2] Proximity of the tower to residential structures and
residential district boundaries;
[3] Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
[4] Surrounding topography;
[5] Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
[6] Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or
eliminating visual obtrusiveness;
[7] Proposed ingress and egress;
[8] Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or
alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or
structures, as discussed in Subsection F(2)(c) of this
section; and
[9] Availability of proposed tower to other potential users.
(c) Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or
alternative technology. No new tower shall be permitted unless
the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Planning Board that no existing tower, structure or
alternative technology that does not require the use of towers
or structures can accommodate the applicant's proposed
antenna. An applicant shall submit information requested by
the Planning Board related to the availability of suitable
existing towers, other structures or alternative technology.
Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower,
structure or alternative technology can accommodate the
applicant's proposed antenna may consist of the following:
[1] No existing towers or structures are located within the
geographic area which meet applicant's engineering
requirements.
[2] Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to
meet applicant's engineering requirements.

structural strength to support applicant's proposed
antenna and related equipment.
§ 85-39.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 85-39.1
1:845
[4] The applicant's proposed antenna would cause
electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the
existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the
existing towers or structures would cause interference
with the applicant's proposed antenna.
[5] The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the
owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to
adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are
unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development
are presumed to be unreasonable.
[6] The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting
factors that render existing towers and structures
unsuitable.
[7] The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology
that does not require the use of towers or structures, such
as cable microcell network using multiple low-powered
transmitters/receivers attached to a wireline system, is
unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed
new tower or antenna development shall not be presumed
to render the technology unsuitable.
(d) Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply to all
towers for which a conditional use permit is required:
[1] Towers must be set back a distance equal to at least 50%
of the height of the tower from any adjoining lot line.
