provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING — A designated AO, AH or VO Zone on
a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one-percent or greater
annual chance of flooding to an average annual depth of one to three feet where a
clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable
and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding
or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD — The land in the floodplain within a
community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
This area may be designated as Zone A, AE, AH, AO, A1-A30, A99, V, VO, VE,
or VI-V30. It is also commonly referred to as the base floodplain or one-hundredyear
floodplain. For purposes of this chapter, the term "special flood hazard area
(SFHA)" is synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard."
BASE FLOOD — The flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT—That portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
BUILDING — See "structure."
CELLAR — Has the same meaning as "basement."
CRAWL SPACE — An enclosed area beneath the lowest elevated floor, 18 inches
or more in height, which is used to service the underside of the lowest elevated
floor. The elevation of the floor of this enclosed area, which may be of soil, gravel,
concrete or other material, must be equal to or above the lowest adjacent exterior
grade. The enclosed crawl space area shall be properly vented to allow for the
equalization of hydrostatic forces which would be experienced during periods of
flooding.
DEVELOPMENT — Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or
materials.

ELEVATED BUILDING — A nonbasement building built, in the case of a
building in Zone A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, or D, to have the top
of the elevated floor or, in the case of a building in Zone V1-30, VE, or V, to
have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor,
elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers),
or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water and adequately anchored so as
not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the
magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zones A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH,
B, C, X, or D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of
fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the
unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of Zone V1-V30, VE, or V,
"elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of
elevated building even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway
walls that meet the federal standards.

Administration
§ 184-10. Designation of local administrator.
The Director of Code Enforcement is hereby appointed local administrator to administer
and implement this chapter by granting or denying floodplain development permits in
accordance with its provisions.
§ 184-11. Floodplain development permit.
§ 184-12. Application for permit.
The applicant shall provide the following information as appropriate. Additional
information may be required on the permit application form.
A. Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for all construction
and other development to be undertaken in areas of special flood hazard in this
community for the purpose of protecting its citizens from increased flood hazards
and ensuring that new development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its
exposure to flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any development in an area
of special flood hazard, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map enumerated in
§ 184-6, without a valid floodplain development permit. Application for a permit
shall be made on forms furnished by the local administrator and may include, but
not be limited to, plans, in duplicate, drawn to scale and showing the nature,
location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question, existing or proposed
structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the
foregoing.
B. Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be accompanied by
an application fee of $250. In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for
reimbursing the Village of East Syracuse for any additional costs necessary for
review, inspection and approval of this project. The local administrator may require
a deposit of no more than $500 to cover these additional costs.
A. The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor (including
basement or cellar) of any new or substantially improved structure to be located in
Zone A1-A30, AE or AH, or Zone A if base flood elevation data is available. Upon
completion of the lowest floor, the permittee shall submit to the local administrator
the as-built elevation, certified by a licensed professional engineer or surveyor.
B. The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any new or
substantially improved nonresidential structure will be floodproofed. Upon
completion of the floodproofed portion of the structure, the permittee shall submit
to the local administrator the as-built floodproofed elevation, certified by a
professional engineer or surveyor.

Duties of the local administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
§ 184-17, Nonresidential structures.
E. A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as
a result of proposed development. Computations by a licensed professional
engineer must be submitted that demonstrate that the altered or relocated segment
will provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. The
applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material required by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the documents
enumerated in § 184-6, when notified by the local administrator, and must pay any
fees or other costs assessed by FEMA for this purpose. The applicant must also
provide assurances that the conveyance capacity of the altered or relocated stream
segment will be maintained.
F. A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, if required by the local
administrator, which shows whether proposed development to be located in an area
of special flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property.
G. In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data is available from other sources, base
flood elevation data shall be provided by the permit applicant for subdivision
proposals and other proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured
home and recreational vehicle parks and subdivisions) that are greater than either
50 lots or five acres.
A. Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the following
permit application review before issuing a floodplain development permit:
(1) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the requirements
of § 184-12, Application for permit, and for compliance with the provisions
and standards of this chapter.
(2) Review subdivision and other proposed new development, including
manufactured home parks, to determine whether proposed building sites will
be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is located in an
area of special flood hazard, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall meet the applicable standards of Article V, Construction
Standards, and, in particular, § 184-14A, Subdivision proposals.
(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special flood
hazard may result in physical damage to any other property (e.g., stream bank
erosion and increased flood velocities). The local administrator may require
the applicant to submit additional technical analyses and data necessary to
complete the determination. If the proposed development may result in
physical damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
Article V, Construction Standards, no permit shall be issued. The applicant
may revise the application to include measures that mitigate or eliminate the
adverse effects and resubmit the application.
(4) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from those

special flood hazard on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
but has neither produced water surface elevation data (these areas are
designated Zone A or V on the FIRM) nor identified a floodway, the local
administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source,
including data developed pursuant to § 184-12G, as criteria for requiring that
new construction, substantial improvements or other proposed development
meet the requirements of this chapter.
(2) When base flood elevation data is not available, the local administrator may
use flood information from any other authoritative source, such as historical
data, to establish flood elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for
the purposes of this chapter.
(3) When an area of special flood hazard, base flood elevation, and/or floodway
data is available from a federal, state or other authoritative source but differs
from the data in the documents enumerated in § 184-6, the local administrator
may reasonably utilize the other flood information to enforce more restrictive
development standards.
C. Alteration of watercourses. The local administrator shall:
(1) Notify adjacent municipalities that may be affected and the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting any alteration
or relocation of a watercourse and submit evidence of such notification to the
Regional Administrator, Region II, Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(2) Determine that the permit holder has provided for maintenance within the
altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying
capacity is not diminished.
D. Construction stage.
(1) In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood elevation data is
available, upon placement of the lowest floor or completion of floodproofing
of a new or substantially improved structure, obtain from the permit holder a
certification of the as-built elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed
elevation, in relation to mean sea level. The certificate shall be prepared by or
under the direct supervision of a licensed land surveyor or professional
engineer and certified by the same. For manufactured homes, the permit holder
shall submit the certificate of elevation upon placement of the structure on the
site. A certificate of elevation must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle
if it remains on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is fully
licensed and ready for highway use).
(2) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval of the
§ 184-13 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION § 184-13
184:15
certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local administrator shall
review all data submitted. Deficiencies detected shall be cause to issue a stopwork
order for the project unless immediately corrected.
E. Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's engineer or architect
shall make periodic inspections at appropriate times throughout the period of
construction in order to monitor compliance with permit conditions and enable said
inspector to certify, if requested, that the development is in compliance with the
requirements of the floodplain development permit and/or any variance provisions.
F. Stop-work orders.
(1) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a stop-work order for
any floodplain development found ongoing without a development permit.
Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject the violator to the penalties
described in § 184-8 of this chapter.
(2) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a stop-work order for
any floodplain development found noncompliant with the provisions of this
chapter and/or the conditions of the development permit. Disregard of a stopwork
order shall subject the violator to the penalties described in § 184-8 of
this chapter.
G. Certificate of compliance.
(1) In areas of special flood hazard, as determined by documents enumerated in
§ 184-6, it shall be unlawful to occupy or to permit the use or occupancy of
any building or premises, or both, or part thereof hereafter created, erected,
changed, converted or wholly or partly altered or enlarged in its use or
structure until a certificate of compliance has been issued by the local
administrator stating that the building or land conforms to the requirements of
this chapter.
(2) A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the local administrator upon
satisfactory completion of all development in areas of special flood hazard.
(3) Issuance of the certificate shall be based upon the inspections conducted as
prescribed in Subsection E, Inspections, and/or any certified elevations,
hydraulic data, floodproofing, anchoring requirements or encroachment
analyses which may have been required as a condition of the approved permit.

flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threat to public
safety.
D. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in
flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased
flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public

floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written notice over the
signature of a community official that:
(a) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood
level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
(b) Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and
property.
(2) Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as

Nuisance Abatement
[Adopted 8-2-2004 by L.L. No. 1-2004 (Part 67 of the 2003 Code)]
§ 233-7. Findings.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of East Syracuse finds that public nuisances exist
in the Village of East Syracuse, New York (hereafter "East Syracuse"), in relation to
certain properties within the Village and/or certain persons and/or animals associated
with certain properties within the Village in violation of local, state and federal laws
relating to controlled substances, dangerous drugs, alcohol, animal fighting, gambling
licenses, prostitution, firearms, possession of stolen property and forgery; the Village
of East Syracuse Municipal Code (hereafter "Municipal Code") relating to disorderly
conduct, public nuisance, licenses, noise abatement, storage of material, storage of
motor vehicles, domestic animals and plants and zoning; the Property Maintenance Code
of New York; and the New York State Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code.
The Board of Trustees further finds that there is an inordinate application of Village
personnel and resources to certain properties due to the repeated violation of these laws
at the properties or by persons associated with the property as an owner, tenant and/or
guest or the repeated calls to certain properties by the East Syracuse Police Department
and or the East Syracuse Fire Department. The Board of Trustees further finds that the
continued occurrence of such activities, violations and inordinate application of Village
personnel and resources to certain properties is detrimental to the commonweal of the
Village and the health, safety and welfare of its citizens, businesses and visitors. It is
the purpose of the Board of Trustees in adopting this article to create additional legal
and equitable remedies relating to the subject matter encompassed by this law, without
prejudice to the use of procedures available under existing and subsequently enacted law,
and to strengthen existing laws on the subject.

regulations or orders and seeking the eviction of a tenant who or whose guest or
other person at the tenancy violated this article, and authorizing the Village to
investigate and enforce this article and any other related law.
B. An owner of real property may be named and be subject to the penalties for offenses
as provided herein as a defendant or additional defendant in any action based upon
a violation of any provision of this article by a tenant, tenant's guest, person or
animal on or at the tenancy.

§ 244-3. Regulations.
Licenses for pawnbrokers shall be subjected to the following regulations:
§ 244-4. Penalties for offenses.
Any person committing an offense against any provision of this article shall, upon
conviction thereof, be guilty of a violation pursuant to the Penal Law of the State of

244:3

ARTICLE II
Secondhand Dealers
§ 244-5. Findings.
§ 244-6. Intent.
A. There is no control in the Village of East Syracuse governing the activities of those
persons engaged in the business of buying and selling secondhand merchandise.
Some of these dealers represent to those persons involved in crime an opportunity
to dispose of stolen property. If the law enforcement agencies are to function, a
local law regulating these secondhand establishments is necessary.
B. The ease with which some secondhand dealers buy and dispose of personal property
indicates the need for the enactment of laws to control and regulate their everyday
business transactions. A few of the dealers require scant or very often no
identification when purchasing personal property and rarely, if ever, is proof of
ownership requested.
C. It is a fact that secondhand dealers are not required at the present time to forward
reports of acquired used property to any police agencies. With the passage of this
article, reports would be required from dealers in secondhand jewelry, marine
equipment, antiques, cameras, coins, stamps, musical instruments, firearms and
televisions, as well as stereophonic equipment. As a result of the reporting, there
would be a marked increase in the number of restitutions for the sole reason that
now these merchants would be committed to keeping accurate records of the used
property purchased and disposed of, by forwarding the proper reports to the police,
on a daily basis, at the close of each business day.
D. This problem involving stolen property is not confined solely to the small dealers.
Some of the very largest retailers in the nation buy large quantities of old gold,
jewelry and diamond and forward not one single report of purchase to any police
agency in the county. The scope for the exploitation of stolen property is further
broadened due to the operations of these merchandising giants.
E. For small or large business enterprises to be allowed to continue to operate without
laws to control and regulate the purchase of secondhand articles not only
jeopardizes the property rights of many people but extremely hampers the police
agencies in their efforts to recover stolen property and identify suspects.
A. The security involved in the handling of secondhand property has become a matter
of concern to the police agencies charged with the duty and responsibility therein.
The increase in the incident of property thefts, the widespread use of alcohol and
drugs, the decline in the value of the dollar, the increase in price of gold and
diamonds and the specter of inflation where barter becomes more a reality all point
to the imperative that the best interests of the people of the Village of East Syracuse
would be served by the enactment of this article.
B. This article will ensure a dramatic rise in the percentage of the stolen property
recovered, an increase in the probability that the general public will receive a fairer
deal in their business transactions and will better the means to allow the police

[Adopted 10-23-2006 by L.L. No. 7-2006 (Part 75 of the 2003 Code)]
§ 265-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this legislation is to establish a uniform program for the registration
and inspection of rental properties within the Village in an effort to help protect and
safeguard the rights, health, safety and welfare of landlords and tenants. Also, the intent
of the program is to ensure proper maintenance of the rental housing stock through the
participation of owners, tenants, the Village and the community through annual building
inspections and registration.
§ 265-2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
AGENT — A representative of a property owner or landlord at least 18 years old and

for residential use. Any special circumstances or conditions under which occupancy is
permitted may be specified on that rental permit.
TENANT — Any person who occupies a non-owner-occupied rental unit.
UNFIT RENTAL UNIT — When a structure or unit(s) is found to be unsafe, unfit for

other than the owner until a rental unit occupancy permit has been obtained for that
unit. A temporary rental unit occupancy permit will be issued upon initial
registration, and that temporary permit will be valid until an initial inspection is
completed. After inspection, the Village may issue a property owner a rental unit
occupancy permit. Following the adoption of this article, all rental unit occupancy
§ 265-1 RENTAL PROPERTY § 265-3
265:3
shall be prohibited without a rental unit occupancy permit, and rental unit
occupancy without a valid permit shall result in the issuance of an "order to vacate"
the occupants of the rental units.
B. Separate registration. The possession of a valid rental unit occupancy permit does
not relieve a landlord of the requirement to re-register each rental unit by December
1 of each and every calendar year.

occupation of a residential dwelling unit within the Village of East Syracuse
(including mixed use properties) for residential use by someone other than the

thereafter, on a form provided by the Village of East Syracuse. All rental units must
be re-registered within 30 days of change of ownership. All fees and the "consent
to inspect" form shall be submitted with the registration form. Landlords whose
primary residence is outside Onondaga, Madison, Oswego, Cortland or Cayuga
County must register an agent on their behalf who lives in Onondaga, Madison,
Oswego, Cortland or Cayuga County and is responsible for the rental property. No
vacant property shall be rented until a rental unit occupancy permit is issued.
D. Inspections. The Housing Inspector(s) and Code Enforcement Officer shall be
authorized, in the performance of their duties, to conduct inspections of properties,
or parts of properties, at such times and in such manner as they may find necessary,
with the consent of the person in possession or occupancy.
E. Independent special inspections. As scheduled by the code enforcement official or
as required by this article or other provisions of law where there is reasonable
question of safety, owners of properties shall be responsible for the inspection and
testing of systems, materials and workmanship that are critical to the integrity of
the building structure and safety of tenants.
F. Qualified personnel. Independent special inspections and tests shall be made by
qualified persons who, because of experience or education, are recognized as
competent by the Code Enforcement Officer. Reports of inspections and tests,
signed by the tester and a witness, together with a statement of any remedial
measures to be taken, shall be filed with the Code Enforcement Officer within 10
days after each inspection and test. If any equipment or system is found to be
defective or not in proper operating condition upon inspection or test, the landlord
shall promptly remedy such defect or condition.
G. Notice of violations. The code enforcement officials shall, in their discretion,
determine the severity of any code violations following an inspection. If a property
owner is cited with a code violation, the inspector will notify the landlord of the
violation and provide the landlord with a reasonable amount of time in which to
make repairs. This provision does not apply to emergency situations or code
infractions deemed to be "serious" in nature. If the violations are not corrected by
the re-inspection date, an appearance ticket may be issued, and a court appearance
will be required.
H. Order to vacate premises. Whenever a notice of violation, as provided in Subsection
§ 265-3 EAST SYRACUSE CODE § 265-3
265:4
§ 265-4. Revocation of rental unit occupancy permit.
The Village of East Syracuse reserves the right to revoke or suspend any rental unit
occupancy permit at any time due to violations of any codes, laws and ordinances of
New York State and the Village of East Syracuse.
§ 265-5. Fees; penalties for offenses.
§ 265-6. Exemptions.
All units annually monitored by the Village of East Syracuse Housing Authority and
New York State Dormitory Authority are exempt from registration and inspection
provisions as outlined in this article.
§ 265-7. Inspection refusals.
If a landlord/tenant refuses to cooperate with an inspection request, after being provided
reasonable notice, an administrative search warrant will be requested from the courts and
the inspector will return with the warrant and police personnel to make the inspection.
§ 265-8. Rules and procedures.
The Village of East Syracuse Board of Trustees shall establish by resolution and may
periodically amend administrative rules, procedures, fees and other provisions of this
article.
G, has not been complied with, or the determination has been made that a property
or unit(s) is unsafe, unfit for human occupancy, unlawful or "serious" in nature,
the Housing Inspector/Code Enforcement Officer may order the rental property or
rental unit(s) to be vacated within such reasonable time as the Code Enforcement
Officer shall direct.
I. Approval to occupy. No such property or unit(s) previously ordered to be vacated
shall be used again for human occupation until written approval and a rental unit
occupancy permit is secured from the Code Enforcement Officer.
A. Fees. Registration and inspection fees shall be set by resolution of the Village of
East Syracuse Board of Trustees. Failure to pay registration and inspection fees
within 60 days of annual registration date will result in the charges being levied
against and added as an additional tax to the subject property.
B. Penalty for offenses. Any person, firm or corporation who or which violates,
disobeys, neglects or refuses to comply with any of the terms of this article shall be
guilty of a violation and be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000. Each week a
violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense.
C. Prior payment. All fees and penalties shall be paid prior to the issuance of any rental
unit occupancy permit.

of the abandoned communications facilities, poles, support
structures or towers. Upon the issuance of a permit, the provider
shall provide a removal bond in the amount estimated for the
removal of all of the communication facilities that are the subject
of an application, such estimated amount to be determined by the
Code Enforcement Officer, after consultation with the Engineer for
the Village.
[4] If the provider fails to timely protect, support, temporarily or
permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter any of its
communications facilities, poles, support structures or towers or
remove any of its abandoned communications facilities, poles,

Waste Haulers
[Adopted 3-24-2003 by L.L. No. 1-2003 as § 714 of the 2003 Code]
§ 289-5. Findings.
Reducing solid waste and recycling are important due to increasing costs of disposal
and environmental impacts. Separating and collecting recyclables is in the public interest
and complies with the County Source Separation Law (L.L. No. 12 of 1989) and
other applicable laws. In 1988, to conserve energy and natural resources, the state
enacted a Solid Waste Management Act establishing a solid waste hierarchy of waste
reduction, reuse, recycling and waste to energy (see State Environmental Conservation
Law § 27-0106), with burial as a last resort. Section B-35 of the State Solid Waste
Management Plan, 1997-98 Update, recommended the County take immediate steps to
develop environmentally acceptable facilities to manage its solid waste. In December of
1991, the County adopted a comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan subsequently
approved by the State Department of Environmental Conservation. This plan, applicable
to county municipalities, preferred waste-to-energy as a safe and sanitary alternative to
the threat to the groundwater supply and other liabilities posed by burying waste, for
reasons listed in § 5 of the Plan. Public Authorities Law § 2045-e, Subdivisions 7 and
8, allow OCRRA to contract with municipalities for the delivery and processing of solid
waste. In compliance with both the State and County Solid Waste Management Plans,
the solid waste generated here and destined for disposal within the state must be disposed
of at the site designated in § 289-10.

ARTICLE I
Stormwater Control
[Adopted 10-15-2007 by L.L. No. 4-2007 (Part 77 of the 2003 Code)]
§ 300-1. Findings; purpose; authority; applicability; exemptions.
A. Findings of fact. It is hereby determined that:
(1) Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover
often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase
stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, or
sediment transport and deposition;
(2) This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of water-borne
pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable
species;
(3) Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add
to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat;
(4) Improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can
increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank
erosion and sedimentation;
(5) Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow;
(6) Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the
waters of the municipality;
(7) Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from
land development activities;
(8) The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates
and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source
pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will
minimize threats to public health and safety; and
(9) Regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards
governing stormwater management and site design will produce development
compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed
and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from
development.
B. Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health,
safety, and welfare of the public residing within this jurisdiction and to address the
findings of fact in Subsection A hereof. This article seeks to meet those purposes
by achieving the following objectives:
(1) Meet the requirements of minimum measures four and five of the SPDES
§ 300-1 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT § 300-1
300:3
General Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Municipal Separate
Stormwater Sewer Systems (MS4s), Permit No. GP-02-02, or as amended or
revised;
(2) Require land development activities to conform to the substantive
requirements of the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) General
Permit for Construction Activities GP-02-01 or as amended or revised;
(3) Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development activities in
order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and stream
bank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels;
(4) Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land
development activities which would otherwise degrade local water quality;
(5) Minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows from any
specific site during and following development to the maximum extent
practicable;
(6) Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint source
pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management practices and
to ensure that these management practices are properly maintained and
eliminate threats to public safety; and
(7) Improve water quality within the Onondaga Lake watershed as Onondaga
Lake has been identified as a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) water body
impaired by the effects from stormwater runoff.
C. Statutory authority. In accordance with § 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law of
the State of New York, the Village of East Syracuse has the authority to enact local
laws and amend local laws and for the purpose of promoting the health, safety, or
general welfare of the Village and for the protection and enhancement of its
physical environment.
D. Applicability.

with the approved plans and specifications and that a one-year inspection has
been conducted and the facilities have been found to be acceptable to the
Village.
(2) Maintenance guarantee. Where stormwater management and erosion and
sediment control facilities are to be operated and maintained by the developer
or by a corporation that owns or manages a nonresidential facility, the
developer, prior to construction, may be required to provide the Village with a
cash escrow or irrevocable letter of credit from an approved financial
institution or surety to ensure proper operation and maintenance of all
stormwater management and erosion control facilities both during and after

subsequent offense, all of which were committed within a period of five years,
punishable by a fine not less than $700 nor more than $1,000 or imprisonment for
a period not to exceed six months, or both. However, for the purposes of conferring
jurisdiction upon courts and judicial officers generally, violations of this article
shall be deemed misdemeanors and for such purpose only all provisions of law
relating to misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each week's continued
violation shall constitute a separate additional violation.
A. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the
notice of violation or, in the event of an appeal, within five business days of the
decision of the municipal authority upholding the decision of the SMO, then the
SMO shall request the owner's permission for access to the subject private property
to take any and all measures reasonably necessary to abate the violation and/or
restore the property.
B. If refused access to the subject private property, the SMO may seek a warrant in a
court of competent jurisdiction to be authorized to enter upon the property to
determine whether a violation has occurred. Upon determination that a violation has
occurred, the SMO may seek a court order to take any and all measures reasonably
necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. The cost of
implementing and maintaining such measures shall be the sole responsibility of the
discharger.

§ 310-7. Notice.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may be given by

to such person at the address given by him in the last return filed by him under this
article, or, if no return has been filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The
mailing of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the
person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the
provisions of this article by the giving of notice shall commence to run from the date of
mailing of such notice.
A. In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or unsatisfactory
to the Village Treasurer, and if a corrected or sufficient return is not filed within 20
days after the same is required by notice from him, or is no return is made for any
period, the Village Treasurer shall determine the amount of tax due from such
information as he is able to obtain, and, if necessary, may estimate the tax on the
basis of external indices or otherwise. He shall give notice of such determination to
the person liable for such tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix
such tax, unless the person against whom it is assessed shall, within 30 days after
the giving of notice of such determination, apply to the Village Treasurer for a
hearing, or unless the Village Treasurer, of his own motion, shall reduce the same.
After such hearing, the Village Treasurer shall give notice of his decision to the
person liable for the tax. Such decision may be reviewed by a proceeding under
Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the State of New York if
application therefor is made within 90 days after the giving of notice of such
decision. An order to review such decision shall not be granted unless the amount
of any tax sought to be reviewed, with interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall
be first deposited with the Village Treasurer and an undertaking filed with him, in
such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve,
to the effect that, if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the applicant
will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such
proceeding, or, at the option of the applicant, such undertaking may be in a sum
sufficient to cover the tax, interest, penalties, costs and charges aforesaid, in which
event the applicant shall not be required to pay such tax, interest and penalties as a
condition precedent to the granting of such order.
B. Except in the case of wilfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax,
no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of more than three
years from the date of the filing of a return; provided, however, that where no return
has been filed as required by this article the tax may be assessed at any time.

310:5
§ 310-8. Failure to file.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return, or to pay any tax or any portion
thereof, within the time required by this article shall be subject to a penalty of five per
centum of the amount of tax due, plus one per centum of such tax for each month of
delay or fraction thereof, excepting the first month, after such return was required to be
filed or such tax became due, but the Village Treasurer, for cause shown, may extend the
time for filing any return, and, if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or
any portion of the penalty fixed by the foregoing provisions of this section.
§ 310-9. Refund.
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer thereof shall make
application for a refund thereof and the Village Treasurer or the court shall determine
that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof was erroneously or illegally collected,
the Village Treasurer shall refund the amount so determined. For like cause and within
the same period, a refund may be so made on the initiative of the Village Treasurer.
However, no refund shall be made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination
of the Village Treasurer as hereinbefore provided unless the Village Treasurer, after a
hearing as hereinbefore provided, or of his own motion, shall have reduced the tax or
penalty or if it shall have been established in a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil
Practice Law and Rules of the State of New York that such determination was erroneous
or illegal. All refunds shall be made out of moneys collected under this article. An
application for a refund, made as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an application
for the revision of any tax or penalty complained of and the Village Treasurer may
receive additional evidence with respect thereto. After making his determination, the
Village Treasurer shall give notice thereof to the person interested, and he shall be
entitled to an order to review such determination under said Article 78 of the Civil
Practice Law and Rules of the State of New York, subject to the provision hereinbefore
contained relating to granting of such an order.
§ 310-10. Tax not to be added to bill.
The tax imposed by this article shall be charged against and be paid by the utility and
shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by the utility to customers or others
but shall constitute a part of the operating costs of such utility.
§ 310-11. Failure to pay tax.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this article, the
Village Attorney shall, upon the request of the Village Board, bring an action to enforce
payment of the same. The proceeds of any judgment obtained in any such action shall be
paid to the Village Treasurer. Each such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property
of the person liable to pay the same, in the same manner and to the same extent that the
tax and penalty imposed by § 186-a of the Tax Law is made a lien.
§ 310-12. Rules and regulations of Treasurer.
In the administration of this article, the Village Treasurer shall have power to make such
reasonable rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law, as may be necessary for the
exercise of his powers and the performance of his duties, and to prescribe the form of

provisions of this article, or on behalf of the State Tax Commission in an action or
proceeding under the provisions of the Tax Law of the State of New York, or on
behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under the provisions of this article,

proceeding, in either of which events the court may require the production of, and
may admit in evidence, so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby as are
pertinent to the action or proceeding, and no more. Nothing herein shall be
construed to prohibit the delivery to a person, or his duly authorized representative,
of a copy of any return filed by him, nor to prohibit the publication of statistics so
classified as to prevent the identification of particular returns and the items thereof,
or the publication of delinquent lists showing the names of persons who have failed
to pay their taxes at the time and in the manner provided for by this article together
with any relevant information which in the opinion of the Village Treasurer may
assist in the collection of such delinquent taxes, or the inspection by the Village
Attorney or other legal representative of the Village of East Syracuse, New York,
of the return of any person who shall bring action to set aside or review the tax

provisions of this article.

§ 340-6. Accessory uses.
Note: Section 340-3 defines "accessory use" as any use conducted as an essential part of
a primary use, as governed by § 340-6.
A. Single-family, which is any building wholly occupied a single dwelling unit.
B. Two-family, which is any building wholly occupied by two dwelling units.
A. Permissibility of accessory use. Accessory uses are part of the primary use and need
not be permitted, conditionally permitted or specially permitted themselves;
however, attributes of the accessory use can disqualify it as detrimental to the
§ 340-5 ZONING § 340-6
340:9
§ 340-7. Nonconformances.
intentions of any section of this Municipal Code during site plan permit review.
B. On adjacent lots. Accessory uses conducted on adjacent lots, any lots within a group
of adjacent lots owned by the same entity, or on lots at some point opposite each
other on a street right-of-way, may be authorized as part of the site plan permit.
C. On non-adjacent lots. Accessory uses on any other lots other than those specified in
Subsection B shall require a special permit.
D. Limits on accessory use. Any accessory use which would require a special permit
or variance if it were the primary use must be specifically authorized as part of the
site plan permit. Such specification should include, where practicable, the portion
of the site occupied by the accessory use and any limitations on noise, light or other
potentially objectionable emissions emanating from the site.
E. Alteration of accessory use. Where any change in operations will place the
accessory use beyond any of the limits specified in the site plan permit, the owner
shall file an amended site plan permit, which shall be reviewed and approved by the
Planning Board. The Planning Board Chair shall require such material and
information with the submission as he or she deems necessary to adequately
consider the proposed changes.
A. Nonconformance defined. A nonconformance is a legally preexisting use or
condition which now is prohibited by, or requires a special permit or compliance
with conditional requirements under, this chapter.
B. Expanding nonconformances. Note: This subsection operates with the clear
understanding that only primary and secondary uses can be nonconforming.
Accessory uses which would be specially permitted or prohibited as primary or
secondary uses, and changes thereto, are governed by § 340-6.
(1) Expansion defined. Expanding a legal nonconformance includes:
(a) Increasing the footprint or number of stories of any structure in which the
nonconforming use is conducted.
(b) Extending the nonconforming use into portions of the lot not previously
so used or to additional lots.
(c) Increasing the scope of the nonconforming use, such as adding
nonconforming offices or warehousing to a nonconforming retail
business, or increasing the height of a fence which is nonconforming due
to its existing height.
(d) Adding equipment in support of the nonconforming use, such as
increasing the number of fuel-dispensing pumps.
(e) Increasing the degree of any area nonconformance, such as increasing the
percentage of the lot occupied by structures where these already exceed
the limits or decreasing an already nonconforming setback.
§ 340-6 EAST SYRACUSE CODE § 340-7
340:10
(f) Changing any other area requirement which is already nonconforming,
such as reducing the number of parking spaces, the width of a driveway
or the dimensions of a loading area.
(g) Changing the nonconformance to a different business within the same use
definition where doing so will increase the level of nuisance to nearby
lots.
(2) Permissible expansion. No expansion of any nonconformance shall be allowed
except where the Planning Board, in the process of reviewing a site plan permit
application for that purpose, finds that such expansion:
(a) Reduces the extent of the nuisance of the nonconformance to nearby lots.
(b) Is reasonably necessary to the viability of the business conducted thereon
and does not increase the objective level of nuisance.
C. Duration of nonconformances. The following applies to all nonconformances,
whether preexisting or permitted by resolution of the Zoning Board of Appeals:
(1) Use variances. Any use variance granted shall attach to the lot for which
granted and only for the specific use for which granted and shall continue
indefinitely unless an expiration date is set by the Zoning Board of Appeals in
the resolution granting the variance. However, any use abandoned for 180
consecutive days, except where caused by damage or destruction beyond the
owner's control, shall expire on the 180th day and shall not be reestablished
without the granting of a new use variance subject to such conditions and
limitations as the Zoning Board of Appeals deems appropriate.
(2) Other variances. Any area, erosion remediation or flood control variance
granted shall attach to the lot on which located and shall continue until such
time as any structure or feature attendant to such variance is removed or
rebuilt, at which time the lot shall require a new site plan permit and shall be
brought into compliance with this chapter to the maximum extent possible.
The Planning Board shall have sole authority to determine the degree of
compliance possible, and the property owner must apply for and secure a
variance for any noncompliance with the Planning Board's determination.
(3) Special permits. Any deviation from this chapter granted by a special permit
shall attach to the owner to which granted and shall expire effective with the
first transfer of ownership, unless the Zoning Board of Appeals sets an earlier
expiration date as part of the resolution granting the special permit. Such
specially permitted use or other feature shall not be reestablished without the
granting of a new special permit subject to such conditions and limitations as
the Zoning Board of Appeals deems appropriate.
(4) Remediation of specific features. Where a variance or special permit expires,
and some specific feature of the lot or structures thereon is functional only for
a use authorized by the variance or special permit, the property owner shall
have 60 days in which to apply for a new variance or special permit, or for a
building permit and site plan permit, where appropriate, to perform the work
necessary to remove such feature.

Village Clerk and referred to the Planning Board for review.
(2) Proof of noninterference. Every communications permit application must
include a preliminary or certified statement that the installation will not
interfere with the radio or television service to adjacent properties or with
public safety communications. If a preliminary statement is included, a final
certified statement of noninterference, prepared by a professional engineer,
will be provided and approved by the Village prior to the issuance of a permit.
(3) Co-location letter of intent. Applicants must submit a letter of intent to abide
by the terms of Subsection D(6).
(4) Notification of adjacent municipalities. To facilitate shared use of existing
structures, all applicants for new communications towers must notify the
legislative body of each municipality bordering the Village and the County
Planning Board, in writing, listing the exact location and height of the
proposed new tower and a general description of the project, including its
capacity for future shared use. Proof of this notification must be submitted
with the application.
(5) Design of antennas, towers, and structures. Each communications permit
application must include detailed drawings and documentation indicating
compliance with Subsection C.
(6) Application fee. Every communications permit application shall be
accompanied by an application fee. The amount of such fee shall be set by the

modifications imposed. Denials shall be supported by substantial evidence.
(4) Existing facilities are inadequate. No proposed communications tower shall be
approved if the Village Board finds that the planned antenna(s) can be
accommodated on an existing or approved communications tower or building
within a search radius of one mile for towers 120 feet or higher, 1/2 mile for
towers 80 to 119.9 feet, or 1/4 mile for towers less than 80 feet high. A finding
that this is not possible requires demonstration of one of the following:
(a) The antenna would exceed the structural capacity of the existing or
approved communications tower or building, as documented by a
qualified professional engineer, and the existing or approved
communications tower cannot be modified or replaced to accommodate
the planned or equivalent antenna at a reasonable cost.
(b) Interference from the antenna, which cannot be prevented at a reasonable
cost, would materially impact another existing or planned antenna on the
communications tower or building, as documented by a qualified
professional engineer.
(c) Existing or approved towers and buildings within the search radius cannot
accommodate the antenna at a height necessary to function reasonably, as
documented by a qualified professional engineer.
(d) Other reasons make it infeasible to locate the antenna upon an existing or
approved communications tower or building.
(5) Tower building requirements.
(a) Communications towers must be self-supporting open framework or
monopoles without the use of guy wire, cables, beams or other external
means of support.
(b) Permanent platforms or structures other than antennas that serve to
increase off-site visibility are prohibited.
(c) No communications tower base may occupy more than 500 square feet
and the tower top cannot be larger than the base.
(d) The minimum spacing between communications towers is 900 feet.
(6) Tower height limitations.

ground.
§ 340-9 ZONING § 340-9
340:15
(b) The Village Board may allow communications towers up to 200 feet
high, if the applicant can demonstrate that off-site views of them will be
minimized by the topography, siting, design, tree cover or screening.
(c) The Village Board may waive height limits for antennas mounted on an
existing structure or to accommodate co-location.
(7) Tower and accessory structure setbacks.
(a) Tower and accessory structure setbacks shall be the minimum setback for
that zone, except that they may encroach into the rear setback if the lot is
zoned industrial and abuts industrially zoned property in the rear and the
tower is not on any easement.
(b) Towers and accessory structures must be set back from existing or
planned public rights-of-way, as shown on the most recently adopted
Village Master Plan or map, by at least half the tower height, including
antennas and attachments.
(c) The Village Board may reduce a communications tower's setback upon
demonstration of compelling reasons to do so.
(8) Screening and security.
(a) Communications towers and accessory structures must be surrounded
with security fencing to prevent unauthorized entry.
(b) Existing vegetation must be preserved to the maximum extent
practicable.
(c) The base of the communications tower and accessory structures must be
landscaped.
(d) Communications towers and antennas must be designed and colored to
blend into the surrounding environment, except where color is dictated by
federal or state agencies.
(e) Antennas on the exterior of a building shall be the same color as the
building.
(f) Accessory structures must be architecturally compatible with principal
structures.
(9) Co-location capability. Proposed communications tower shall accommodate:
(a) The applicant's antennas and comparable antennas for one additional
user, and a second if the tower is over 100 feet high.
(b) Future rearrangement of antennas.
(c) Antennas mounted at varying heights.
(10) Decennial review. The Village Board (or at its designation the Planning
Board) reviews all communications permits every 10th year to determine if
technology has changed sufficiently to eliminate or change the need for the
§ 340-9 EAST SYRACUSE CODE § 340-9
340:16
tower and the permit should be modified or terminated as a result.
D. Communications permit obligations.
(1) Compliance with other laws. Permit holders shall provide the Village Clerk
with copies of all licenses and permits required by other agencies, keep these
current and provide proof of renewals or extensions.
(2) Transfer of permit. No communications permit or any rights thereunder may
be transferred except with the written permission of the Village Board.
(3) Antenna safety. Antennas are subject to state and federal regulations for
nonionizing radiation and other health hazards. The owner shall submit
evidence yearly of compliance with FCC standards. If more restrictive
standards are adopted, antennas must comply or the Village Board may restrict
continued operations. The permit holder shall pay for verifying compliance.
(4) Tower lighting. Communications towers shall not be artificially lit or have
strobe lights unless so required by a federal or state agency. Lights may be
incorporated into the tower design to illuminate playing fields, parking lots
and similar areas.
(5) Signs and advertising. No portion of any communications tower shall be used
for signs other than warning or equipment information signs.
(6) Co-location letter of intent. The applicant shall submit a letter of intent to the
Village Board which, if the permit is approved, commits the applicant and any
successors to:
(a) Respond in a timely and comprehensive manner to a request for
information from a potential shared-use applicant.
(b) Negotiate in good faith for shared use of the tower by other PWS
providers.
(c) Allow shared use if another PWS provider agrees in writing to pay
charges.
(d) Make no more than a reasonable charge for shared use based on generally
accepted accounting principles. The charge may include, but is not
limited to, a pro rata share of the cost of site selection, planning, project
administration, land costs, site design, construction, maintenance,
financing, return on equity, depreciation, and all costs of adapting the
towers or equipment to accommodate a shared user without causing
electromagnetic interference.
(7) Unused towers. Unused towers and associated facilities shall be removed
within 12 months of ceasing operations at the site, unless an extension is
approved by the Village Board. A copy of the relevant portions of a signed
lease requiring the applicant to remove all facilities upon cessation shall
accompany the application. Facilities not removed within 12 months of
cessation may be removed by the Village and the cost added to the property
tax levy.
