AN ORDINANCE APPROVING, ADOPTING AND ENACTING THE CODIFIED ORDINANCES OF
SPRINGBORO, OHIO, REPEALING ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH AND PUBLISHING THE
ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER.
   WHEREAS, the Council of the Municipality of Springboro, Ohio, has had the
matter of recodification and general revision of the ordinances before it for
some time; and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with The Walter H.  Drane
Company to prepare and publish such recodification and general revision; and
   WHEREAS, the recodification and general revision of such ordinances,
together with the new matter to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those
to be repealed, are before the Council;
   NOW, THEREFORE, THE MUNICIPALITY OF SPRINGBORO, OHIO HEREBY ORDAINS:
SECTION I.
   That the ordinances and resolutions of the Municipality of Springboro, Ohio,
of a general and permanent nature, as revised, recodified, arranged and
consolidated into component codes, titles, chapters and sections, are hereby
approved, adopted and enacted as the Springboro Municipal Code, 2000, for which
designation “Codified Ordinances” may be substituted.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk of Council, attached to this ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the Municipality of Springboro,
Ohio.
SECTION II.

except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provision
prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for
the enforcement of such right or liability.  Such enactment shall not be
construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in the
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor.  For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and codification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or

      (3)   The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment;
      (4)   The assumption of any contract or obligation;
      (5)   The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness;
      (6)   The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges;

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 408.01 indicates the code number is 4, the chapter number
is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section number is .01.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063 follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

CHARTER
OF THE
CITY OF SPRINGBORO, OHIO
PREAMBLE
   We, the people of the City of Springboro, Warren County, Ohio and Montgomery
County, Ohio, in order to secure the benefits of local self-government under
the Constitution of the State of Ohio, do adopt this Charter for the government
of the City of Springboro.  (Amended 11-4-08.)
Article I
NAME AND BOUNDARIES
SECTION 1.01  Name.
   The City now existing in the County of Warren and the County of Montgomery,
State of Ohio, and known as the Village of Springboro, shall continue to be a

laws of Ohio, is a city, and it shall be known as the City of Springboro. 
(Amended 11-4-08.)
SECTION 1.02  Boundaries.
   The City shall have the same boundaries as now exist, with the power and
authority to change its boundaries and annex other territory contiguous thereto
in the manner authorized by the laws of the State of Ohio.  (Amended 11-4-08.)
Article II
FORM OF GOVERNMENT
SECTION 2.01  Form of Government.
   The government provided for by this Charter shall be known as the Council-
Manager form.
Article III
POWERS
SECTION 3.01  Powers of the City.
   Except as restricted by this Charter, the City shall have all powers
possible for a City to have under the Constitution and laws of the State of
Ohio, as fully and completely as though they were specifically enumerated in
this Charter. 
(Amended 11-4-08.)
SECTION 3.02  Manner of Exercise of Powers.
   All such powers shall be exercised in the manner prescribed in this Charter,
or, if not prescribed herein, in such manner as the Council may determine by
ordinance, resolution, or motion.  Ordinances and Resolutions intended to
supersede the Ohio Revised Code under the authority of the Ohio Constitution
and Section
3.01 of this Charter need not include language confirming such intent. 
(Amended 11-4-08.)
SECTION 3.03  Construction.
The powers of the City under this Charter shall be construed liberally in favor
of the Charter and the City, and the enumeration of particular and specific

the State of Ohio. As used in this Charter, unless the context otherwise
requires, the singular includes the plural and the plural includes the
singular; words of one gender include the other gender; and words in the

thereof, not inconsistent with the general law or the Constitution of the State
of Ohio, or the Constitution or laws of the United States.  (Amended 11-4-08.)
Article IV
THE COUNCIL
SECTION 4.01  Powers, Number, Selection and Term.
   (a)    Except as limited or directed by this Charter, all powers of the City
not inconsistent with this Charter shall be vested in a Council which shall
have power to legislate under the authority of this Charter and to enact all
ordinances and resolutions necessary and proper for carrying into execution the
purposes of this Charter. Council shall consist of seven (7) Council Members,
of which six (6) shall be Council Members elected for overlapping terms, as
modified by Section
13.03, and one (1) shall be separately elected as Mayor as provided by Sections
4.03 and
13.04.
   (b)    Two (2) Council Members and the Mayor will be elected at large for a
four (4)-year term of office and every four (4) years thereafter. Two (2) years
later, and every four (4) years thereafter, four (4) Council Members will be
elected from wards for a four (4)-year term of office. Within six (6) months
after the adoption of this Charter, Council shall divide the City into four (4)
wards for purposes of electing ward Council Members. Within one (1) year
following receipt of each Federal decennial census information, or at any other
time when necessary to achieve substantially equal population in each ward, the
Council will redivide the City into four (4) wards of substantially equal
population
   (c)    The regular term of Council Members and the Mayor shall begin the
first day of January following their election. Each shall take the oath of
office after certification of election by the Board of Elections, but prior to
the first day of January following their election. They will serve until their
successors are chosen and are qualified as such. If a Council Member-elect
fails to qualify, or dies, or resigns, the position shall be filled according
to the provisions of this Charter for vacancies in Council. All elections of
Council Members and the Mayor shall be on a nonpartisan basis.  (Amended 11-4-
08.)
SECTION 4.02  Eligibility.
   Any qualified elector of the City who also has been a resident of the City
for two consecutive years at the time of filing one's candidacy with the Warren
County Board of Elections shall be eligible to hold the office of Council
Member or Mayor. Only qualified electors of each respective ward shall be
eligible to hold office as ward Council Members. 
(Amended 11-4-08.)
SECTION 4.03  Mayor and Deputy-Mayor.
   (a)    Mayor.  The Mayor shall be elected by separate ballot from the City-
at-large for a four (4)-year term. The Mayor shall be a Council Member and have
the right to vote on all issues before the Council, but shall have no veto
power. In addition to the powers, rights and duties as a Council Member as
herein provided, the Mayor, when present, shall preside at meetings of the
Council, shall be recognized as head of the City government for all ceremonial
and non-administrative purposes, by the Governor for purposes of military law,
and by the Courts for civil process involving the City. The Mayor shall have
judicial powers. The Mayor shall perform all other duties prescribed for the
office by ordinance or by resolutions of the Council not inconsistent with the
provisions of this Charter.
   (b)    Deputy-Mayor.  The Council shall, at the first regular meeting in
January following its election, choose, by a majority vote of all members of
the Council, one of its members a Deputy-Mayor who shall act as Mayor during
the absence or disability of the Mayor. If a vacancy occurs, the Deputy-Mayor
shall serve as Mayor until the next regular City election. At such election, a
Mayor shall be elected to serve for the unexpired term, if any; if not, for a
full term. Upon the election of a Mayor, other than the Deputy-Mayor then
serving as Mayor, the Deputy-Mayor may retain a position as Council Member for
the remainder of his unexpired term. 
   In the event of a vacancy in the office of Mayor whereby the Deputy-Mayor is
required to serve as Mayor, the Council shall select a person to fill the
vacancy in Council as provided in Section
4.05(d). However, the person so chosen shall serve only until a Mayor is
elected as provided herein. (Amended 11-4-08.)
SECTION 4.04  Prohibitions.
   (a)    Holding Other Offices.  Except where authorized by this Charter,
neither a Council Member nor the Mayor shall hold any other City office or City
employment during the term for which said Council Member or Mayor was elected
or appointed to the Council, and no former Council Member or Mayor shall hold
any compensated appointive City office or City employment until two (2) years
after the expiration of the term for which he was elected or appointed except
for an appointment to Council to fill an unexpired term pursuant to Section
4.05.  No member of the Council shall hold any incompatible office.
   (b)    Appointment and Removals.  Neither the Council nor any of its
members, including the Mayor, shall in any manner dictate the appointment or
removal of any City officers or employees whom the Manager or any subordinates
are empowered to appoint or remove, but the Council as a body meeting with the
Manager may express its views, and fully and freely discuss with the Manager
anything pertaining to appointment and removal of such officers and employees.
   (c)    Authority of Manager.  The Council or its members shall deal with the
City officers and employees who are subject to the direction and supervision of
the Manager solely through the Manager, and neither the Council nor its members
shall give any orders to any such officer or employee, either publicly or
privately.
   (d)   Personal Financial Interest.  Any Council Member of the City who has a
financial interest, direct or indirect, in any contract with the City or in the
sale of any land, material or services to the City or to a contractor supplying
the City shall make known that interest and shall refrain from voting upon or
otherwise participating in that capacity as an elected official of the City in
making of such sale or in the making or performance of such contract. 
Violation of this section with the knowledge, express or implied, of the person
or corporation contracting with or making a sale to the City shall render the
contract or sale voidable by the Council.  (Amended 11-4-08.)
SECTION 4.05  Vacancies; Forfeiture of Office; Disability; Filling of
Vacancies.
   (a)   Vacancies.  The office of Council Member shall become vacant upon the
Council Member's death, resignation, removal from office in any manner
authorized by this Charter, or forfeiture of office.
   (b)    Forfeiture of Office.  A Council Member shall forfeit office if said
Council Member:
      (1)    Lacks at any time during a term of office, any qualifications for
the office prescribed by this Charter;
      (2)    Intentionally violates any express prohibition of this Charter;
      (3)    Is convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude or malfeasance;
      (4)    Fails to attend three consecutive regular meetings of Council,
without being excused by the Council.
   (c)    Disability.  On questions of disability involving the Mayor, Deputy-
Mayor or Council Member, the decision as to actuality of, the time of, and the
duration of the disability for purposes of declaring a vacancy shall be
determined by a majority vote of the remaining members of Council.
   (d)    Filling of Vacancies.  Vacancies in the office of Council Member
shall be filled within thirty (30) days by vote of a majority of the remaining
members of Council. If a vacancy occurs on one (1) or more positions among
Council Members elect, Council of the new term shall appoint, by majority vote,
an eligible citizen of the City of Springboro. If the Council fails to do so
within thirty (30) days following the occurrence of the vacancy, the power of
Council to fill the vacancy shall lapse and the Mayor shall fill the vacancy by
appointment immediately following the expiration of the said thirty (30) days.
Any appointee under this section shall qualify under the provisions of this
Charter, shall hold office, and shall serve for the unexpired term or until a
successor is elected and qualified, or until replaced by a Deputy Mayor who has
been serving as Mayor and who is returning to the position of Council Member
pursuant to Section
4.03(b). 
      (Amended 11-4-08.)
SECTION 4.06  Recall.
   The electors shall have the power to remove from office, by recall election,
any elected officer of the City. If an elected officer shall have served for
six (6) months of a term, a petition demanding his removal may be filed with
the Clerk of Council who shall note thereon the name and address of the elector
filing the petition, and the date of such filing. Such petition may be
circulated in separate parts, but the separate parts shall be bound together
and filed as one instrument. Each part shall contain the name and office of the
person whose removal is sought, and a statement in not more than two hundred
(200) words of the grounds for removal.
   (a)    In the case of a Ward Council Member, such petition shall be signed
by at least fifteen (15) percent of the total number of registered voters from
that Ward at the time of the most recent election for that position. For the
purposes of recall, an appointed Ward Councilman shall be treated as an elected
member.
   (b)    In the case of an at-large Council Member or the Mayor, such petition
shall be signed by at least fifteen (15) percent of the total number of
registered voters from the City at the time of the most recent election for
that position. For the purposes of recall, an appointed at-large Council Member
shall be treated as an elected member. Within ten days after the day on which
such petition is filed, the Clerk of Council shall determine whether or not it
meets the requirements hereof.
   If the Clerk of Council shall find the petition insufficient, the Clerk
shall within twenty (20) days certify the particulars in which the petition is
defective, deliver a copy of the certificate to the person who filed the
petition with the Clerk, and make a record of such delivery. Such person shall
be allowed a period of twenty (20) days after the day on which such delivery
was made in which to make the petition sufficient. If the Clerk of Council
shall find the petition sufficient, the Clerk shall within twenty (20) days so
certify to the Council, shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the officer
whose removal is sought, and shall make a record of such delivery. If such
officer shall not resign within five (5) days after the day on which such
delivery shall have been made, the Council shall thereupon fix a day for
holding a recall election, not less than six (6) days nor more than seventy-
five (75) days after the date of such delivery. 
   At such recall election, conducted by the Board of Elections of Warren
County, Ohio, as stated in Section
11.02, this question shall be placed on the ballot: "Shall (naming the officer)
be allowed to continue as (naming the office)?" with provision on the ballot
for voting affirmatively or negatively on such question. If a majority of the
votes cast at such election be voted affirmatively, such officer shall remain
in office. If a majority of the votes cast shall be voted negatively, such
officer shall be considered as removed, said office shall be deemed vacant, and
such vacancy shall be filled as provided in this Charter. The officer removed
by such recall election shall not be eligible for appointment to the vacancy
thereby.  (Amended 11-4-08.)
SECTION 4.07  Compensation.
   The Council may determine the annual salary of Council Members by ordinance,
but no ordinance increasing such salaries shall become effective until the
commencement of the terms of Council Members elected at the next regular
election, provided that such election follows the adoption of such ordinance by
at least six (6) months. Contributions to the Public Employees Retirement
System for Council members shall be made in the same manner as for all regular,
full-time City employees.  The Mayor shall receive additional compensation.
Council Members, by resolution of Council, stating the exact purpose of the
appropriation, may receive their actual and necessary expenses incurred in the
performance of their duties of office. 
(Amended 11-4-08.)
SECTION 4.08  Judge of Qualifications.
   The Council shall be the sole judge of the election and qualifications of
its Council Members-elect and its own members, and the grounds for forfeiture
of their office, as listed in Section
4.05, and for that purpose Council, by ordinance, shall prescribe the process
of citing witnesses, administering oaths and producing evidence, and its
enforcement. If by an affirmative vote of five (5) members of Council, a
witness is declared in violation of the ordinance enforcing this section, the
case shall be referred to the Law Director for appropriate action before the
proper court.
   A member charged with conduct constituting grounds for forfeiture of office,
shall be entitled to a public hearing on demand, and notice of such hearing
shall be published in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the City
at least fifteen (15) days in advance of the hearing.  (Amended 11-4-08.)
SECTION 4.09  Clerk of Council.
   There shall be a Clerk of Council, selected by a vote of a majority of all
members of the Council, from outside its membership, to serve until a successor
is chosen and enters upon the duties of this office. The Clerk shall give
notice of Council meetings and all other meetings as required by State law,
keep the journal, advertise public hearings, record in a separate book all
ordinances and resolutions approved by Council and see that such enactments are
published as required by this Charter. The Clerk shall perform such other
duties as may be assigned by this Charter, or by ordinance or resolution of the
Council.    
   The Clerk may be appointed to serve full or part time and shall receive a
salary for services as such, as established by ordinance.
SECTION 4.10  Procedure.
   (a)    Meetings.  The Council shall meet regularly at least twice in every
month at such times and places as the Council may prescribe by rule. Special
meetings may be held on the call of the Mayor or of four (4) or more members
and, whenever practicable, upon no less than twelve (12) hours notice to each
member. All meetings where official business is consummated shall be public
except as otherwise provided by Ohio statute.
   (b)    Rules and Journal.  The Council shall adopt and may amend its own
rules and order of business, in conformity with this Charter, and shall provide
for keeping a Journal of its proceedings. This Journal shall be a public
record.
   (c)    Voting.  Except on procedural motions, voting shall be by roll call
and shall be recorded in the Journal. Four (4) members of the Council shall
constitute a quorum, but a smaller number may adjourn from time to time and may
compel the attendance of absent members in the manner and subject to the
penalties prescribed by the rules of the Council.  Unless a different
requirement is otherwise specifically provided for in this Charter, no action
of the Council shall be valid and binding unless adopted by the affirmative
vote of four (4) or more members of the Council.  (Amended 11-7-00.)
SECTION 4.11  Independent Audit.
   During those years in which the State of Ohio shall make an audit of the
affairs of the City, such audit may be accepted as satisfying the requirements
of this section. In any other years, Council may, when it deems it advisable,
provide for an annual audit by a certified public accountant or firm of such
accountants.  (Amended 11-4-08.)
Article V
LEGISLATION
SECTION 5.01  Ordinances and Resolutions.
   Council action shall be by ordinance, resolution or motion. Ordinances shall
be the enactments of the Council and shall have the full force and effect of
law. Ordinances shall prescribe permanent rules of conduct of government.
Resolutions shall be orders or declarations of the Council of a special or
temporary nature.  Motions are oral proposals for Council action limited to the
same purposes as resolutions.  (Amended 11-7-00.)
SECTION 5.02  Introduction of Ordinances.
   All proposed ordinances shall be introduced in written or printed form and
may be reviewed by the Law Director for correct legal form, for possible
contradiction with existing ordinances; or conflict with the Charter or
Constitutional provisions.  It shall be in the form required by Council for
final adoption.  No ordinance shall contain more than one subject, which shall
be clearly expressed in its title.  The one subject rule shall not apply to
appropriation ordinances, omnibus revisions of the City Code, or other
ordinances, which necessarily or logically contain more than one subject.  The
enacting clause shall be "The City of Springboro hereby ordains . . ." 
(Amended 11-4-08.)
SECTION 5.03  Passage of Ordinances.
   Ordinances and resolutions must be introduced in written or printed form
capable of being read if they are of general or permanent nature, grant a
franchise, create a right, involve the expenditure of money or levy of a tax,
provide for the purchase, lease, sale, or transfer of property.
   Ordinances or resolutions of a general or permanent nature or for the
purposes set forth above are required to be read by title only, on three
different days, unless such readings are dispensed with by a vote of five (5)
members elected to the Council. When the requirement of reading on three (3)
different days is dispensed with by the required vote, only one (1) reading is
required and the ordinance or resolution may be passed forthwith or at a
subsequent meeting by the majority vote of Council. 
(Amended 11-7-00.)
SECTION 5.04  Effective Date.
   Every ordinance, except emergency ordinances, shall become effective at the
expiration of thirty (30) days after adoption or at any later date specified
therein.
SECTION 5.05  Emergency Ordinances.
   To meet a public emergency affecting health, safety, morals, or the public
welfare, or a special emergency in the operation of a City department the
Council may adopt one or more emergency ordinances, but such ordinances may
not: levy taxes, except when incidental to incurring debt; grant, renew, or
extend a franchise, except one affecting health; regulate the rate charged by
any public utility for its services; or grant any special privileges. An
emergency ordinance shall be introduced in the form and manner prescribed for
ordinances generally, except that it shall be plainly designated as an
emergency ordinance and shall contain, after the enacting clause, a declaration
stating that an emergency exists and describing it in clear and specific terms.
A proposed emergency ordinance may be adopted with or without amendment or
rejected at the meeting at which it is introduced, but the affirmative vote of
at least five (5) members of Council shall be required for adoption. After its
adoption the ordinance shall be published as prescribed for other adopted
ordinances. It shall become effective upon adoption or at such later time as it
may specify. 
   An emergency ordinance may also be repealed by adoption of a repealing
ordinance in the same manner specified in this section for adoption of
emergency ordinances. No emergency ordinance shall be subject to the initiative
and referendum.  (Amended 11-4-08.)
SECTION 5.06  Adoption of Ordinances by Reference.
   The Council may adopt model or standard codes prepared and published by any
public or private agency by reference to the date and source of the code
without reproducing it at length in the ordinance. However, if the Council
desires to modify, add to, or eliminate from any such code any section or part
thereof, such addition, modification or omission shall be clearly stated in the
ordinance. In all such cases in which such a code shall be adopted by
reference, publication of the code at length, by the City, shall not be
required. However, at least one copy of all such codes, including all
amendments thereto, shall be kept in the office of the Clerk of Council for
consultation by interested persons during regular office hours and additional
copies shall be for sale, when available, at cost, by the Clerk of Council. 
(Amended 11-4-08.)
SECTION 5.07  Initiative and Referendum.
   Except as otherwise provided by this Charter, legislative ordinances may be
proposed, and legislative ordinances passed by the City Council may be
challenged, by initiative and referendum following procedures set forth in the
Ohio Revised Code.  However, referendum shall not be applicable to emergency
ordinances, resolutions, motions, ordinances implementing administrative
actions, or ordinances making adjudicatory decisions.  If the Council is
required to pass more than one ordinance to complete and pay for any public
improvement, initiative and referendum shall apply only to the first ordinance
passed and not to any subsequent ordinance.  Initiative and referendum
petitions shall not be deemed filed with the City until a written receipt
therefor, indicating the time and date of filing, has been issued by the Clerk
of Council. 
(Amended 11-4-08.)
SECTION 5.08  Resolutions.
   Action taken by Council, which is not required by this Charter to be taken
by ordinance, may be taken by resolution. No waiting period, notice, hearing or
publication shall be required and a resolution shall become effective upon its
adoption.  (Amended 11-7-00.)
SECTION 5.09  Authentication and Recording; Codification; Reproduction.
   (a)    Authentication and Recording.  The Clerk of Council shall
authenticate by the Clerk's signature, along with the signature of the
Presiding Officer of the Council, and record in full, in a properly indexed
journal kept for the purpose, all ordinances and resolutions adopted by the
Council.
   (b)    Codification.  At least every two (2) years, the Council shall
provide a general codification of all City ordinances and resolutions having
the force and effect of law. The general codification shall be adopted by the
Council and shall be published promptly in bound or loose-leaf form, together
with this Charter and any amendments thereto, including any pertinent
provisions (as the Council may specify) of the Ohio Constitution, other laws of
the State of Ohio, codes of technical regulations, and other rules and
regulations or pertinent supplementary matter of service or interest. This
compilation shall be known and cited officially as the Springboro City Code.
Copies of the City Code shall be furnished to City officers, placed in public
City offices for free public reference, and made available for purchase by the
public at cost as determined by Council.
   (c)    Reproduction of Ordinances and Resolutions.  The Council shall cause
each ordinance and resolution having the force and effect of law and each
amendment to this Charter to be reproduced promptly following its adoption, and
the reproduced ordinances and resolutions and Charter amendments shall be
distributed or sold to the public at cost as determined by the Council. The
Council shall make further arrangements as it deems necessary with respect to
reproduction and distribution of any changes in or additions to the provisions
of the Constitution and other laws of the State of Ohio, or the codes of
technical regulations, and rules and regulations included in the City Code. 
(Amended 11-4-08.)
SECTION 5.10  Mandatory Requirements for Formation of City Contracts.
   No agreement obligating the City to pay money or undertake debt; or to sell,
buy or encumber real or personal property; or to lease real or personal
property to or from others; or to accept real or personal property; or to
perform any act or refrain from performing any act; or to become obligated for
any combination of these; shall be enforceable against the City unless the
agreement satisfies the following requirements and formalities, which are
mandatory:
   (a)   It has been specifically approved by an ordinance or resolution
adopted by the Council, or categorically approved by an ordinance adopted by
the Council for inclusion in the Administrative Code for the purpose of
facilitating routine transactions.
   (b)   It is in writing, with the date of execution by each signatory
separately indicated.
   (c)   It has been executed by the City Manager, or by his designee under
those circumstances in which the City Manager is authorized by ordinance to
appoint a designee.
   Nothing in this Section shall be construed as preventing the City from
performing all or part of an unenforceable contract if in its interest to do
so, but neither full or part performance by the City or by any other party
shall create any legal or equitable obligation enforceable against the City.
   The Council may by ordinance establish additional formalities, rules and
procedures controlling the formation of City contracts.  Nothing in this
Section shall prevent the retroactive approval of a contract by the Council by
ordinance or resolution.
   By the publication of this Charter, all persons doing business with the City
shall be deemed to have constructive notice of these mandatory limitations on
City contracting.  Such persons have an affirmative duty to assure themselves
that all applicable legal requirements have been complied with for the
formation of a City contract, and failing to do so, assume the risk of doing
business under an unenforceable contract.  (Amended 11-4-08.)
Article VI

202.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except

liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the

   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
202.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
202.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
202.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
202.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

provided in a manner sinmilar to Ohio’s Design Professional Selection Law. 
(ORC 153.71)  An analysis of the written proposals must be completed by the
department director or Manager and will ordinarily culminate in the

established in subsection (d) hereof. The employee share amount “picked up” and
paid by the City shall not be included in the gross pay of the employee, and
shall be in lieu of any contribution which might otherwise be made by the
employee.
(Ord. 00-22.  Passed 4-6-00.)
   (b)   No person subject to the “pick-up” shall have the option of choosing
to receive the statutorily required contribution to PERS directly instead of
having it “picked up” by the Municipality or of being excluded from the “pick-
up”.
   (c)   The Municipality shall, in reporting and making remittance to PERS,
report that the public employee’s contribution for each person subject to this
“pick-up” has been made as provided by the statute.

shall be payable, subject to applicable payroll deductions, to that employee. 
The Municipality shall compute and remit its employer contributions to PERS
based upon an employee’s earnable salary.  (Ord. 93-3.  Passed 1-7-93.)
   (g)   The Finance Director is hereby authorized and directed to implement

hereof so as to enable them to obtain the result in federal and State tax

of the classes established in subsection (i) hereof.  The employee share amount
“picked-up” and paid by the City shall not be included in the gross pay of the
employee, shall be in lieu of any contribution which might otherwise be made by
the employee, and shall be set at a rate of 7.45% of the mandatory contribution
of 10% required under Section 742.31 of the Ohio Revised Code per Resolution R-
04-85, dated December 16, 2004.
   (i)   The “pick-up” by the Municipality provided in this section shall apply

      (1)   Supervisory police personnel not approved or designated by the City

Authority. The notice shall state the purpose, time, date and place of the
public hearing. Monarch Trees may be designated on either public or private
property, including public property not controlled by the City.

maintenance of Monarch Trees located on their premises.  Although proper
maintenance is the legal responsibility of the owner, the City may subsidize
significant preservation projects at any percentage up to fifty percent (50%)

the project is affordable, cost-effective and has priority, and (ii) sufficient
funds are available for cost- sharing purposes at that time.  The Tree
Authority shall develop an application form and evaluation standards and
procedures pursuant to this section, and may periodically recommend projects

sharing program, the City shall not be a party to a contract with any person or
firm performing work on private property, and any property owner receiving
cost- sharing shall as consideration therefor release and indemnify the City
from all liability.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the City to
cost-share in any particular Monarch Tree maintenance project, regardless of
its merit or the availability of funds.

C.   All final cuts shall be made just outside the branch collar. Extremely
deep cuts which produce  excessively wide wounds or weaken the tree shall not
be made.
(2)   "Minimum or Safety Prune".
A.   Description of "Minimum or Safety Prune". This operation of tree trimming
shall consist of the minimum performance necessary to correct one or more
extreme and undesirable conditions existing within a tree which may be
hazardous to persons or property.
B.   Specifications for "Minimum or Safety Prune".
1.   Remove all dead and dying branches two inches or more in diameter.
2.   Remove all broken or loose branches two inches  or more in diameter.
3.   Reduce the length of branches which extend excessively beyond the
perimeter of an otherwise symmetrical form.
4.   Cut back ends of branches and reduce weight of bunches where excessive
breakage of supporting limbs appears likely. Do not remove live, healthy
branches in excess of six inches in diameter without consent of the Tree
Authority or its designee.
      (3)   "Head Back Prune".
A.   Description of "Head Back Prune". This operation shall consist of reducing
the height and/or spread of a tree by not more than one- third and shall only
be applied to trees when such work is necessary to control extended growth
which may endanger overhead utility lines or interfere with adjacent
structures.
B.    Specifications of "Head Back Prune".
1.   This form of pruning trees shall be done by means of a method called "drop
crotching" which serves to shorten branch structure and thereby limits the
extent of the foliage canopy to a natural appearing margin. This action
consists of removing perimeter branches at their lower junction with shorter
side branches.
2.   No cuts on living branches shall be made in excess of six inches in
diameter without first securing specific consent of the City Forester (or his
appointed authority).
3.   Extended perimeter branches shall be properly cut at their junction with
lower branches having a basal diameter of at least one-third of the diameter of
the cut so affected.
4.   The remaining lower branches shall be retained intact to form a reduced
foliage perimeter at a specific height and/or spread.
5.   This technique of tree pruning shall be applied only when larger growing
trees endanger overhead utility lines or where excessive growth of trees
interferes with adjacent structures or otherwise creates a specific hazard to
persons or property.
6.   "Head Back Prune" should not be attempted or used if the metabolism of a
tree would be seriously unbalanced by the use of this technique or where the
structure of the tree would be weakened by such action. Trees not repairable
shall be removed rather than pruned with this method.
(4)   "Spot Prune".
A.   Description of "Spot Prune". This operation of tree pruning shall consist
of the removal of one or more branches localized in a particular area of the
crown of a tree.
B.   Specifications for "Spot Prune".
1.   Trees shall be pruned in such a manner as to prevent bunch and foliage
interference with requirements of safe public passage. Over street clearance
shall be kept to a minimum of fourteen  feet above the paved surface of the
street and eight feet over the surface of the public sidewalk or pedestrian
way.
2.   Sprout or sucker growth shall be removed to a minimum height of eight feet
above the  ground level. Exceptions are allowed for young trees which would be
irreparably damaged by such trimming action.
3.   Individual or scattered dead or broken limbs shall be promptly and
properly removed without  the necessity of performing other work not
immediately urgent for protection of the public or property, or the health of
the tree.
   (c)   Supplementary Pruning Specifications for Monarch  Trees.  The 
following additional requirements shall apply to the pruning of Monarch trees:
(1)   No tree shall be cut back in such a manner that its health will be
impaired. An exception to this may occur in the removal or emergency relief of
an immediate danger to persons or property.
(2)   When tree pruning cuts are made to a side branch, such remaining branch
must possess a basal thickness of at least one-third of the diameter of the
wound so affected. Such cuts shall be considered proper only when such
remaining branch is vigorous enough to maintain adequate foliage to produce
woody growth capable of healing the cut within a reasonable period of time.
(3)   All final tree pruning cuts shall be made in such a manner as to favor
the earliest possible covering of the wood by natural callus growth.
Excessively deep flush cuts which produce large wounds or weaken the tree at
the cut shall not be made. Tree pruning cuts should be made just outside the
branch collar.
(4)   Tree branches shall be removed and controlled in such a manner as not to
cause damage to other parts of the tree or to other plants or property.
(5)   All tools used on a tree known to contain an infectious tree disease
shall be properly disinfected immediately after completing work in such a tree.
(6)   Maples, birches and walnut trees shall be pruned only when in leaf except
where conditions hazardous to the public or property are involved.
(7)   All cutting tools and saws used in making tree pruning cuts shall be kept
sharpened adequately to result in final cuts with a smooth surface and secure
bark remaining adjacent thereto.
(8)   Whenever pruning cuts are to be made while removing branches too large to
hold securely in one hand during the cutting operation, the branches shall be
cut off first one to two  feet beyond the intended final cut. Then the final
cut shall be made in a manner to prevent unnecessary tearing back of bark and
wood.
(9)   Any cutting of tree roots, other than when in the process of tree
removal, shall give due consideration to the future welfare of the tree. Proper
action shall be taken, utilizing the latest scientific  techniques, to treat
resulting wounds to prevent entry of decay organisms.
(10)   The use of climbing spurs or spike shoes in the act of pruning trees is
prohibited.
(11)   Under no condition shall it be considered proper to leave any severed or
partially cut  branches in the upper portion of any tree being worked on after
the tree workers leave the scene of the operation.
(12)   Public trees or utility poles shall not be used as an anchor for winch
trunks in the process of removing other trees.
(13)   When removing a tree, the act of cutting tree roots and then leaving the
work scene with a standing tree having little or no support is prohibited.
         (Ord. 95-61. Passed 11-2-95.)

TITLE TEN - Judiciary
Chap.
290. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 290
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R. C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Springboro has
jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of a
Springboro ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving
moving traffic violations occurring on State highways located within the
corporate limits of Springboro, subject to the limitations of Ohio R.C. 2937.08
and 2938.04. In keeping his docket and file, the Mayor shall be governed by the
laws pertaining to county courts.
   Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him, waives a jury and
consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such event, does
not waive his or her right to a jury trial, then the magistrate shall require
the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear before a court of record in
Warren County and the magistrate shall thereupon certify all papers filed,
together with a transcript of proceedings and accrued costs to date, and such
recognizance, if given, to the court of record. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio
Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that in petty offense cases, where there
is a right to jury trial, the defendant shall be tried by the court unless he
demands a jury trial. But the jurisdiction of a Mayor's Court, in such cases,
is further limited by Rule 9 of the Ohio Traffic Rules, which provides that if
a jury demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and the defendant
waives his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case only if (1)
his compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor.
   Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury shall
be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the
clerk of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for
trial or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for
trial, whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04, provides that
right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor
and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the
date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice
of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to claim a jury trial as
provided herein is a complete waiver of the right thereto. Ohio R.C. 2938.04
provides, further, that a jury trial may not be had in courts not of record,
but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial may be
asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of record
as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Springboro ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated "Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas," the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended
Rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1975.

evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

414.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
414.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
414.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
414.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
414.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)

the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used.  (ORC 4511.14)

a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,

person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.

attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services

As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the

in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be

license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into

either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio

minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

have more than one valid license at any time.  (ORC 4507.02)
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever

to, the fact that the employer, school official, or official affiliated with a
religious event provided the holder of a  probationary driver’s license with

over the violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle
upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking for a period not to exceed six months

holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection.  In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted.  If a person is convicted of,
pleads guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a
second or subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the
violation may terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this
division.
      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under

determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of

if the stepparent has not adopted the probationary license holder;
         G.   An eligible adult, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4507.05.
      (3)   “Moving violation” means any violation of any statute or ordinance
that regulates the operation of vehicles, streetcars, or trackless trolleys on
the highways or streets.  “Moving violation” does not include a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4513.263 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a
violation of any statute or ordinance regulating pedestrians or the parking of
vehicles, vehicle size or load limitations, vehicle fitness requirements, or

DRIVING.

age of eighteen years and no holder of a probationary driver’s license shall
drive a motor vehicle on any street, highway, or property used by the public

electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to either of the
following:

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct.  However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept

properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section.  The
person charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may

practice in this State under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4731 or a chiropractor licensed
to practice in this State under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4734 that states that the
person has a physical impairment that makes use of an occupant restraining
device impossible or impractical.
   (d)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on
any street or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (b) hereof has been or is being
committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or summons for
a violation of that nature or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution
of a person for a violation of that nature, and no law enforcement officer
shall view the interior or visually inspect any automobile being operated on
any street or highway for the sole purpose of determining whether a violation

person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an automobile being
operated by that person is wearing all of the available elements of a properly
adjusted occupant restraining device, in violation of subsection (b)(2)  of
this section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort
action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.  But the trier of
fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of
evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action
and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic
loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.  Evidence of that failure

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.     It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the
occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.

accordance with this subsection and Ohio R.C. 3781.111 (C) shall be mounted on
a fixed or movable post, and the distance from the ground to the bottom edge of
the sign shall measure not less than five feet.  If a new sign or a replacement
sign designating a special parking location is posted on or after October 14,
1999, there also shall be affixed upon the surface of that sign or affixed next

   (f)   (1)   A.   No person shall stop, stand or park any motor vehicle at
special parking locations provided under subsection (e) hereof, or at special

and storage fees normally imposed by the Municipality for towing and storing
motor vehicles.  If the motor vehicle is a leased vehicle, it shall not be
released to the lessee until the lessee presents proof that that person is the
lessee of the motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally
imposed by the Municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles.

section, it is an affirmative defense to the charge that the person suffered an
injury not more than seventy-two hours prior to the time the person was issued
the ticket or citation and that, because of the injury, the person meets at
least one of the criteria contained in Ohio R.C. 4503.44(A)(1).

displaying a removable windshield placard or a temporary removable windshield
placard or special license plates, or when a motor vehicle is being operated by
or for the transport of a handicapped person and is displaying a parking card
or special handicapped license plates, the motor vehicle is permitted to park
for a period of two hours in excess of the legal parking period permitted by
local authorities, except where local ordinances or police rules provide

record and need not be reported by the person so arrested or convicted in
response to any inquiries contained in any application for employment, license,
or other right or privilege, or made in connection with the person’s appearance
as a witness.

606.02  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely

from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such

also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
606.02.

resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.

or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which

section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit

   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
606.08 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.  (ORC
2901.24)
606.10  FALSIFICATION.

      (12)   The statement is made in a document or instrument of writing that

patient’s or client’s records.

subsection, “counseling services” include services provided in an informal

offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:

subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.

from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."

testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged

the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.

the witness stand, to evalute such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.

misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.

of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:

license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.

642.24  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   Where more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
642.02, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
642.02,
642.04, or
642.05,
642.15(b)(1) or (2), or Section
642.19 or
642.34 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
642.02, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
642.02 or
642.19 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
642.02 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
642.02,
642.04 or
642.05, Section
642.15(b)(1) or (2), or Section
642.19 or
642.34, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
642.02 or
642.19, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series. 
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received thereby, is
prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)
642.25  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
642.09:
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing which is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of property or the amount of physical harm involved
is the amount which would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under paragraph (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under paragraph (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, “fair market value” has the same meaning as
defined in Section
642.24(c)(3).
 
   (c)   Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section

legitimate use;

   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of

opening of another.  Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,

   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting

      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which
inspires disgust or revulsion in persons with ordinary sensibilities, without
serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to

primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than
primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.

genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.

continuation of the occupancy of, or continue the occupancy of, a structure,
building or portion thereof used for human habitation, unless such structure,
building or portion thereof is free from unclean and unsanitary conditions, as
provided in this chapter, and unless this chapter is complied with.
(1977 Code Sec. 94.05)
   (b)    Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
Punishment shall be as provided in Section
698.02.
668.02  CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING UNCLEAN AND UNSANITARY CONDITIONS.
   (a)    Any structure, building or portion thereof used for human habitation
shall be deemed to be in an unclean and unsanitary condition by reason of any
portion of such building being infected with a communicable disease, by reason
of the absence therein of toilet facilities as required by law or ordinance or
by reason of the known presence of sewer gas therein or thereon.
   (b)    Any structure, building or portion thereof used for human habitation
shall be deemed to be in an unclean and unsanitary condition when unfit for
human habitation or in a condition dangerous or harmful to the lives or health
of the occupants by reason of the inhabited portion of the house being damp or

building or portion thereof used for human habitation which is in such an
unclean or unsanitary condition is hereby declared to constitute a public
nuisance. (1977 Code Sec. 94.06)
668.03  NOTICE TO ABATE NUISANCES OR VACATE PREMISES.
   (a)    Whenever the County Board of Health ascertains from examination or

nuisance exists, as provided in Section
668.02, in or upon any structure, building or portion thereof, and is of the
opinion that such nuisance is capable of being abated without immediate
vacation of such structure, building or portion thereof, and serves notice upon
the owner of such structure or building, or his or her lessee or agent, or the
person in possession, charge or control thereof, directing such person to abate
such nuisance and remove the unclean or unsanitary conditions within such
reasonable time as may be fixed by the Board and specified in such notice, such
person shall abate such nuisance within such time. Whenever such abatement does
not take place within such time, or whenever, in the opinion of the Board, such
abatement is impossible or impractical without an immediate vacation of such
structure, building or portion thereof, and the Board serves notice upon such
person to vacate or cause the vacation of such structure, building or portion
thereof designated in the notice, then it shall be the duty of such person to
vacate or cause the vacation of such structure, building or portion thereof
within twenty days from the date of the service of such notice, or within a
shorter time (not less than twenty-four hours in any case) as may be specified
in such notice. Whenever, either in addition to or without the service of such
notice on such person, the Board is of the opinion that such nuisance can be
abated by a tenant or other occupant of such structure, building or portion
thereof, and such notice, either for abatement of the nuisance or for vacation
of the premises, is served upon such tenant or other occupant, then it shall be
the duty of such tenant or other occupant to comply with the terms of such
notice and to abate the nuisance or vacate the premises accordingly. After the
receipt of any such notice, no person shall occupy or permit the occupancy of
such premises or portion thereof until such nuisance has been completely abated

make  such service, or service by registered letter, or if the address of the
owner, lessee, agent or person in possession, charge or control is unknown, or

by publication once a week for two consecutive weeks in any newspaper of
general circulation in the Municipality, or by posting or attaching to or on
the outside of such structure or building of a copy of the notice or order
consecutively for two weeks, shall have the same effect as service within the
Municipality. (1977 Code Sec. 94.07)
   (b)    Whoever violates or fails to comply with this section is guilty of a
minor misdemeanor. Punishment shall be as provided in Section
698.02.

not be enforced, and unless the Board, or a majority thereof, is present at its
office at the time so specified, provided that when, in the opinion of at least
four-fifths of the members of the Board, an emergency exists which requires,
for the protection of the health of occupants, the vacation of the building or
portion thereof without a delay of five days, then no such fixing of a time for
hearing shall be required. (1977 Code Sec. 94.08)
668.05  POSTING NOTICES OF VACATION.
   Whenever such procedure, in the opinion of the County Board of Health, is
desirable or necessary, the Board may affix conspicuously on the structure,
building or part thereof the notice of vacation. (1977 Code Sec. 94.09)
668.06  ENFORCEMENT OF VACATION ORDERS.
When the notice of vacation has not been complied with, and the County Board of
Health certifies such fact to the Chief of Police, together with a copy of the
notice, the Chief shall enforce such notice of vacation and cause the premises
to be vacated in accordance with the terms of such notice. (1977 Code Sec.

legal or equitable, that may be appropriate or necessary for the enforcement of
such notice and the abatement of the nuisance against which such notice was
directed, such suits or proceedings to be brought in the name of the
Municipality. Proceedings under this section shall not relieve any party
defendant from criminal prosecution or punishment under these Codified
Ordinances or any other criminal law or ordinance in force within the
Municipality.
(1977 Code Sec. 94.11)
668.08  HOTELS, LODGING HOUSES, ETC.

pleaded guilty to a violation of subsection (a) of this section as the
subsection existed prior to September 30, 2011, and if the conduct that was the
basis of the violation no longer would be a violation of subsection (a) of this
section on or after September 30, 2011, due to the application of subsection
(b)(4) of this section as it exists on and after September 30, 2011, the person
may file an application under Ohio R.C. 2953.37 requesting the expungement of
the record of conviction.

of this section is a minor misdemeanor, and the offender’s concealed handgun
license shall not be suspended pursuant to division (A)(2) of Ohio R.C.
2923.128.  A violation of subsection (b)(3) or (4) of this section is a
misdemeanor of the first degree or, if the offender previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of subsection (b)(3) or (4) of
this section, a felony and shall be prosecuted under appropriate State law.  In

of subsection (b)(3) or (4) of this section, the offender’s concealed handgun
license shall be suspended pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2923.128(A)(2).
   (g)   If a law enforcement officer stops a motor vehicle for a traffic stop
or any other purpose, if any person in the motor vehicle surrenders a firearm
to the officer, either voluntarily or pursuant to a request or demand of the
officer, and if the officer does not charge the person with a violation of this
section or arrest the person for any offense, the person is not otherwise
prohibited by law from possessing the firearm, and the firearm is not
contraband, the officer shall return the firearm to the person at the
termination of the stop.  If a court orders a law enforcement officer to return

the same compartment, the magazine or speed loader is contained within a
separate enclosure in that compartment that does not contain the firearm and
that closes using a snap, button, buckle, zipper, hook and loop closing
mechanism, or other fastener that must be opened to access the contents or the
firearm is contained within a separate enclosure of that nature in that
compartment that does not contain the magazine or speed loader;
               b.   A pocket or other enclosure on the person of the person in

he commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)    Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses,

   (b)    “Dangerous offender” means a person who has committed an offense,

698.02  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
      A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
      B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
      C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
      D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08 shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).
         (ORC 2929.31)
698.03  IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)    In determining whether to impose imprisonment or a fine, or both, for
misdemeanor, and in determining the term of imprisonment and the amount and
method of payment of a fine, the court shall consider the risk that the
offender will commit another offense and the need for protecting the public
therefrom, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history, character
and condition of the offender and his need for correctional or rehabilitative
treatment, and the ability and resources of the offender and the nature of the
burden that payment of a fine will impose on him.
   
   (b)   The following do not control the court's discretion, but shall be
considered in favor of imposing imprisonment for misdemeanor:
      (1)    The offender is a repeat or dangerous offender;
      (2)    Regardless of whether or not the offender knew the age of the
victim, the victim of the offense was sixty-five years of age or older or
permanently and totally disabled at the time of the commission of the offense.
   (c)    The criteria listed in Ohio R. C. 2929.12, favoring shorter terms of
imprisonment for felony, do not control the court's discretion, but shall be
considered against imposing imprisonment for misdemeanor.
 
   (d)    The criteria listed in subsections (b) and (c) hereof shall not be
construed to limit the matters which may be considered in determining whether
to impose imprisonment for misdemeanor.
 
   (e)    The court shall not impose a fine in addition to imprisonment for
misdemeanor, unless a fine is specially adapted to deterrence of the offense or
the correction of the offender, or the offense has proximately resulted in
physical harm to the person or property of another, or the offense was
committed for hire or for purpose of gain.
 
   (f)    The court shall not impose a fine or fines which, in the aggregate
and to the extent not suspended by the court, exceeds the amount which the
offender is or will be able to pay by the method and within the time allowed
without undue hardship to himself or his dependents, or will prevent him from
making restitution or reparation to the victim of his offense.
 
   (g)    At the time of sentencing or as soon as possible after sentencing,
the court shall notify the victim of the offense of his right to file an
application for an award of reparations pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2743.51 through
2743.72. (ORC 2929.22)
698.04  ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)    Regardless of the penalties provided in Section
698.02, or in any other section of these Codified Ordinances, an organization
convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08 shall be fined, which fine shall be fixed by the court as follows:
      (1)    For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000);
      (2)    For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four
thousand dollars ($4,000);
      (3)    For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three
thousand dollars ($3,000);
      (4)    For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two thousand

      (5)    For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000);
      (6)    For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000);
      (7)    For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000) .
   (b)    When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
 
   (c)    When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
 
   (d)    This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05  MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)    Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other sentence of
imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the State, another state,
or the United Slates. In any case, a sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a sentence of imprisonment for felony served
in a State or Federal penal or reformatory institution.
 
   (b)    A sentence of imprisonment shall be served consecutively to any other
sentence of imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively.
 
   (c)    Subject to the maximum provided in subsection (d) hereof, when
consecutive sentences of imprisonment are imposed for misdemeanor, the term to
be served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms imposed.
 
   (d)    Consecutive terms of imprisonment imposed shall not exceed an
aggregate term of eighteen months, when the consecutive terms imposed are for
misdemeanors. When consecutive terms aggregating more than one year are imposed
for misdemeanors under the Ohio Revised Code or these Codified Ordinances, and
at least one such consecutive term is for a misdemeanor of the first degree
that is an offense of violence, the trial court may order the aggregate term
imposed to be served in a State penal or reformatory institution. (ORC 2929.41)
698.06  MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE.
   (a)    At the time of sentencing and after sentencing, when imprisonment for
misdemeanor is imposed, the court may:
      (1)    Suspend the sentence and place the offender on probation pursuant
to Ohio R.C. 2951.02;
      (2)    Suspend the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2951.02 upon any terms
that the court considers appropriate;
      (3)    Permit the offender to serve his sentence in intermittent
confinement, overnight, or on weekends, or both, or at any other time or times
that will allow him to continue at his occupation or care for his family; or

be served in intermittent confinement, and suspend the balance of the sentence
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2951.02 upon any terms that the court considers
appropriate or suspend the balance of the sentence and place the offender on
probation pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2951.02.
   (b)    At the time of sentencing and after sentencing, when a fine is
imposed, the court may:
      (1)    Suspend all or any portion of the fine, upon any conditions that
the court imposes in the interests of justice and the correction and
rehabilitation of the offender; or
      (2)    Permit payment of all or any portion of the fine in installments,
or by any other method and in any time and on any terms that the court
considers just, except that the maximum time permitted for payment shall not
exceed two years. (ORC 2929.51)

   EDITOR'S NOTE: Significant and wide-ranging amendments to ORC 718 were
enacted by Am Sub HB 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by
Governor Kasich on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal

States relating to federal income tax shall control over the use of the term in

doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
section
881.052 of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section.  An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.  (Ord. 15-30.  Passed 11-19-
15.)
   (B)   (1)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit

deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld

Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         (a)     Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not
required to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the last day of the month following the last day
of each calendar quarter.
         (b)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the

hundred dollars. Payments under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be
made to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of

to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section. Once the threshold for remitting payment
electronically for federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income
tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality
shall be remitted to the Municipality at the same time that the federal tax
withholding payment is due.
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the  Municipality requires all resident individual
taxpayers to file a tax return under section
881.091 of this Chapter,
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required  under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the

qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,

   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable

qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal

performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)     For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day.  For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to

owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
881.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of section

deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)    A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (5)    If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)    The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)    The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)    For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)    For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or
annual return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or
filed late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at
the rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (I)    Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section
881.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld. 
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.  (Ord.  15-30.  Passed 11-19-15.)

portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the

Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

taxable year.
      (2)     An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that

taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
 881.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that

purpose of making the computations required in Section
881.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit

included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
881.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income

make the computations required under Section 881.062 of this Chapter by
substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to" for "net
profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,

an affiliated group.

         (a)    Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as
paid to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal
amounts on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which
all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         (c)   A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve months
shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         (d)   Taxes withheld by a casino operator or by a lottery sales agent

are withheld from the taxpayer's winnings.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section
881.091 of this Chapter or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the
first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the

      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.  (Ord. 15-30.  Passed 11-19-15.)
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the

liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the tax liability for the taxable year; 
provided, however, for tax years beginning on and  after January 1, 2018 for an
individual, on or before the fifteenth day of the first month of the following
taxable year, ninety per cent of the tax liability for the taxable year. For a
person other than an individual, on or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth
month of the taxable year, ninety percent of the tax liability for the taxable
year.
            (Ord. O-18-3.  Passed 2-15-18.)
      (2)    A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator.  When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates.  The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with section
881.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)     For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and  are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return
is due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless
extended pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)     For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)     An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year.  A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to section 881.10 of
this Chapter upon  the  amount  of  underpayment  for  the  period  of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
 881.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)     The  taxpayer  is  an  individual  who  resides  in  the
Municipality  but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the
calendar year that includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.
(Ord.  15-30.  Passed 11-19-15.)
881.08  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
881.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (A)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the Municipality who receives
net profits, salaries, wages, commissions or other personal service
compensation for work done or services performed or rendered outside of the
Municipality, and who is liable and has paid to another municipality an income
tax on the same income taxable and taxed under this chapter,  shall be allowed
a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter of the amount so paid by him
or her or in his or her behalf to such other municipality. Provided  however,
in no event shall the amount of the credit exceed one percent (1%) of the
income subject to taxation as herein provided.
   (B)   If the total amount of credits granted under this Section exceed the
total amount of tax owing to the Municipality before application of all such
credits, then no refund shall be due or payable to the taxpayer.  (Ord.  15-
30.  Passed 11-19-15.)
881.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    “Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)    Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)    If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord.  15-30.  Passed 11-19-15.)
881.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   (A)    Subject to subsection (B) below, a Municipality shall grant a credit
against its tax on income to a resident of the Municipality who works in a
joint economic development zone created under section 715.691 or a joint
economic development district created under section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72
of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent that it grants a credit against its
tax on income to its residents who are employed in another municipal
corporation, pursuant to Section
881.081 of this Chapter.
   (B)   To meet the spirit and intent of the Lytle Five Points Road Joint
Economic Development District, and in order to advance certain public purposes
including but not limited to economic development, job creation and retention
and educational benefits resulting from the continued existence of the Lytle
Five Points Road Joint Economic Development District, an individual taxpayer
who resides in the Municipality and works in the Lytle Five Points Road Joint
Economic Development District, shall receive an additional credit not to exceed
one half percent (0.5%) of the income subject to taxation as herein provided if
it is made to appear that he or she has paid income tax on the same income
taxable under this chapter to the Lytle Five Points Road Joint Economic
Development District.
   (C)  If the total amount of credits granted under this Section and
881.081 exceed the total amount of tax owing to the Municipality before
application of all such credits, then no refund shall be due or payable to the
taxpayer.  (Ord.  15-30.  Passed 11-19-15.)
881.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
881.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality.  To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
881.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
881.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation.  Section
881.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord.  15-30.  Passed 11-19-15.)

individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under subsection

Such duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support

This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact

   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator. 
      (5)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or

      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal

         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
881.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
881.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
881.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall

or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.

failure to remit the amounts withheld. 
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person.    Authorization by the taxpayer
of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)     When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in section
 881.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. 
The tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer
who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation.  The affidavit also shall include the
following statement:  "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year.  If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules."  The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year.  It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with
the provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of
municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an
affidavit has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. 
Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from
performing an audit of the person.

tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,

within the time prescribed in section
881.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this

undocumented credits or losses. 
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)

ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on

   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inureto the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized.  The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord.  15-30.  Passed 11-19-15.)
881.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter.  Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord.  15-30.  Passed 11-19-15.)
881.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information. 
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to section
881.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
section
881.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to section
 881.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in section
881.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
 881.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord.  15-30.  Passed 11-19-15.)
881.14  CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy, or otherwise. The Tax Administrator of the
Municipality or a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or
otherwise received under this chapter and other related tax information to the
Internal Revenue Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of
other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord.  15-30.  Passed 11-19-15.)
881.15  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with  the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord.  15-30.  Passed 11-19-15.)
881.16  OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of section
881.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord.  15-30.  Passed 11-19-15.)
881.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.  (Ord.  15-30.  Passed 11-19-15.)
881.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX  REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.  The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the
Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality.
Two members shall be appointed by City Council, and may not be employees,
elected officials, or contractors with the City of Springboro at any time
during their term or in the five years immediately preceding the date of
appointment. One member shall be appointed by the City Manager. This member may
be an employee of the City of Springboro, but may not be the Finance Director
or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
City Council shall be two years. There is no limit on the number of terms that
a member may serve should the member be reappointed by City Council. The board
member appointed by the City Manager shall serve at their discretion.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)     If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the City Council or
City Manager that appointed the member shall appoint another individual to
temporarily serve on the board in the member's place.  This appointment shall
be subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
      (8)     No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment,  the manner in which the taxpayer
may appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be
directed, and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
         
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination.  The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review.  Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code.  For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing.  Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code.  For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord.  15-30.  Passed 11-19-15.)
881.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
881.18 of this Chapter.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
881.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal.  The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.   
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
881.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
881.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord.  15-30.  Passed 11-19-15.)
881.20  ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the Municipality,
pursuant to this Chapter, grants authority to the Tax Administrator with the
advance approval of the City Finance Director, to adopt rules to administer the
income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on

   (B)   Every owner, landlord, lessor and sub-lessor of any real property in
the Municipal Corporation who is presently renting or leasing real property to

Administrator, containing the name and mailing address of each tenant.
(Ord.  15-30.  Passed 11-19-15.)
881.97  COLLECTION AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and  actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so
levied or enforcing any provisions of this chapter are concerned, it shall
continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the

been fully terminated, subject to the limitations contained in Section
881.19.
   (B)  Annual returns due for all or any part of the last effective year of

881.091 as though the same were continuing.
(Ord.  15-30.  Passed 11-19-15.)
881.98  SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax imposed
against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income
specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this chapter.  It is hereby declared to be the intention of the
legislative authority of the Municipality that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section
or part thereof not been included in this chapter.  This Chapter and each
section and provision of this Chapter, are hereby declared to be independent
sections and subsections and, notwithstanding any other evidence of legislative
intent, the Council of the Municipality, by adoption of the legislation
containing this section, hereby states that it is the controlling legislative
intent that if any provisions of said Chapter, or the application thereof to
any person or such sections and provisions to any person or circumstances other
than those to which it is held invalid, shall not be affected thereby, and it
is hereby declared that such sections and provisions would have been passed
independently if such section or provision were so known to be invalid.  The
adoption of this Chapter in a single legislative act is merely for convenience.

890.01  TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Springboro Community
Reinvestment Program”. 
(Ord. 915.  Passed 12-4-80.)
890.02  ESTABLISHMENT.
   Pursuant to the Municipal Charter and the Ohio Revised Code, there is hereby
established a Municipal community reinvestment program.
(Ord. 915.  Passed 12-4-80.)
890.03  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to spur the economic development or
redevelopment of identified areas which are lagging, deteriorating or depressed
to a degree that they no longer contribute satisfactorily to the economy and
well being of their neighborhoods, or which already are, or soon may
constitute, a material economic or social deficit to the surrounding community.
(Ord. 915.  Passed 12-4-80.)
890.04  TAX ABATEMENT.
   (a)   Generally.  State legislation now permits municipal corporations to
create community reinvestment areas.  Within such areas, property owners who
are willing to improve their property, by either remodeling or by new
construction, may receive partial tax set-aside, or abatement, for a limited
number of years.  Such abatement applies only to that part of their total real
property value which is the increase brought about by the improvement. 
Personal property taxes cannot be abated under the community reinvestment
program.
   (b)   Taxes Continuing in Force.  Taxes which are in force on real property,
such as land and the buildings thereon, and which exist before any improvement
is made under such program, remain in effect for that portion of the property
for the life of any tax abatement program that may be established.  All
personal property taxes levied on tools, equipment, machinery, fixtures,
inventory, etc., before the start of an abatement program, and such taxes on
all new personal property added during the life of an abatement period, will
continue to be collected in the same manner as taxes collected from a like
establishment which is not in a community reinvestment area.
   (c)   Improvements Eligible for Tax Abatement.  The following are the upper
time limits for tax abatement on real property improvements in a community
reinvestment area, which may be granted by Council:
      (1)   Up to ten years for existing one and two-family dwellings, with
remodeling of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) or more;
      (2)   Up to twelve years for existing dwellings of more than two units
and existing commercial and industrial structures, with remodeling of five
thousand dollars ($5,000) or more; and
      (3)   Up to fifteen years for any newly constructed dwelling or
commercial or industrial building.
   The time limits enumerated in this subsection are the maximum number of
years of tax abatement that may be granted or negotiated by the approving
authority at the time each reinvestment area is established.  When the number
of years of abatement is set for each of three improvement categories above,
they remain fixed and may be granted to owners making such improvements within
the reinvestment area.  The approving authority, however, at the start of each
program, may also establish, if it wishes, a lesser time period during which
applications may be filed to become eligible for the abatement. Such periods
for application eligibility may later be extended or renewed by the approving
authority, subject to the conditions of the law at that time.
   (d)   Program Study.  As the result of the establishment of community
reinvestment areas, current tax yields are never lost, reduced or abated.  Only
that portion of a potentially increased tax yield which, by encouragement of
such program, would be brought about by major remodeling, or new construction,
and only to the extent that it increases the value of the real property, and
only for a limited number of years, may be so abated.  All previously existing
taxes, including all personal property taxes, continue to flow, in full, as
before.
(Ord. 915.  Passed 12-4-80; Ord. 00-22.  Passed 4-6-00.)
890.05  AUTHORITY; RESOLUTION FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF AREAS.
   The authority for this program is set forth in Ohio R.C. 3735.65 through
3735.70.  Any community reinvestment area established in the incorporated area
of the Municipality shall be established by resolution of Council.
(Ord. 915.  Passed 12-4-80.)
890.06  CRITERIA FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF AREAS.
   Criteria have been established to identify possible areas to be designated
for community reinvestment and to evaluate the nature and the amount of the
benefit to be gained by the Municipality if tax abatement is made available
under the community reinvestment program.  It is anticipated that this
authority will be used carefully by Council and will be restricted to those
cases which will provide a substantial benefit for a long period of time.
   As a consequence, the deliberations leading to the creation of a community
reinvestment area will be thorough.  Since each candidate area and each
applicant will have varying conditions unique to its particular circumstances,
the following criteria are selected as a check list and to structure the
deliberations.  Such criteria are not intended to be used as a weighted scoring
mechanism.  It is conceivable that under certain circumstances a strongly
adverse, single condition may be a sufficient reason for not designating a
certain area or for not offering tax abatement to a certain applicant.  On the
other hand, only two or three strongly favorable circumstances may weigh
heavily enough to properly merit the establishment of an area or the offer of
abatement to an applicant.
   In the following lists of criteria, groupings are solely to facilitate the
collection and analysis of information by subject areas, in an orderly
fashion.  Relative positions of individual items in the list do not connote
either priority consideration or relative importance.
   The review criteria for the establishment of community reinvestment areas
are as follows:
   (a)   Preconditions.  Preconditions for the establishment of such areas are
as follows:
      (1)   The identification of a delineated area which requires stimulus for
economic development;
      (2)   The provision of tax abatement by a private company to locate or to
expend within the area; and
      (3)   A determination of the lowest negotiable number of years of
abatement to conclude the inducement.
   (b)   Conditions Pertaining to the New Undertaking.  Conditions pertaining
to the new undertaking are as follows:
      (1)   A substantial number of new jobs will be created.
      (2)   Significant local expenditures in addition to payroll will be made.
      (3)   The parent company is financially sound and reasonable.
      (4)   There is forseeable long-term demand for the product or the
service.
      (5)   The applicant provides descriptive plans, building and equipment
layouts, a description of intended operations, products or services and the
proposed equity investment.
      (6)   An estimate of the increase of business for existing local service
industries and suppliers is made.
      (7)   An estimate for the requirement for the establishment of new local
service industries and suppliers is made.
      (8)   The value-added rating of the industrial classification of the
applicant’s product or service is considered.
      (9)   The environmental effect on the surrounding community is
considered.
      (10)   The potential enhancement of the quality of life of the present
inhabitants by favorable attributes of the new work force is considered.
      (11)   The accommodation of the General Development Plan and the Zoning
Code is considered.
      (12)   The accommodation of local utilities and transportation is
considered.
      (13)   The accommodation of local schools, functions of local government
and various community services is considered.
      (14)   The impact on the present housing supply, potential housing areas
that could be developed and the housing industry is considered.
      (15)   The nature and extent of the impact on the present labor force are
considered.
      (16)   The character and quality of the proposed operation, as it relates
to community ethics and standards, compatibility with community objectives and
contribution to community developmental goals, are considered.
   (c)   Conditions Pertaining to the Good of the Municipality, the State and
the Nation.  The following conditions pertaining to the good of the
Municipality, the State and the nation shall be considered:
      (1)   The possible value of a company of a smaller size which by itself,
or by its output, makes a contribution, on a regional or national scale, of
recognized industrial, economic, educational, cultural, scientific, strategic
or other importance;
      (2)   Any undertaking, such as a research establishment, academic
institution, corporation headquarters and the like, whose operation will bring
a material talent bank and favorable identification and recognition to the
Municipality; and
      (3)   A determination if offsetting State or Federal financial assistance
may be provided for the project.
   (d)   Conditions Pertaining to the Taxation Balance of Payments.  Detailed
preparation and analysis of the following three property-tax scenarios for each
reinvestment program under consideration shall be made:
      (1)   Without the proposed improvement;
      (2)   With the improvement but without abatement; and
      (3)   With the improvement and with abatement.
         (Ord. 915.  Passed 12-4-80; Ord. 00-22.  Passed 4-6-00.)
890.07  PROCEDURES FOR ESTABLISHMENT; HOUSING OFFICER; HOUSING COUNCIL.
   (a)   Generally.  Detailed procedures concerning the establishment of a
community reinvestment area, definitions, the appointment of a Housing Officer,
applications for exemption from taxation, revocation, the Housing Council and
appeals are contained in Ohio R.C. 3735.65 through 3765.70 and are hereby

inspections of properties for which an exemption has been granted.
         (Ord. 915.  Passed 12-4-80.)
   (c)   Initiating Authorities.  Council may institute a community
reinvestment program by completing steps (1) through (4) of subsection (b)
hereof and ensuring that the Housing Council is constituted according to the

location, and should also contain a description of the present property and a
brief description and approximate dollar value of the proposed or underway
improvement and, if the work has already been completed, the date of such
completion.  Depending on the nature and size of the improvement, either a
short form application or a more complete questionnaire (copies of which are

which the exemption is granted and the period of the exemption, in years, as
determined by the legislative authority pursuant to that division.
   (f)   Starting Date of the Exemption.  The tax exemption shall first apply

shall consider: whether the issuing of the Certificate of Registration will not
compromise  the health, safety, and welfare of the City and its citizens;
whether issuing of the Certificate of Registration will be consistent with this
chapter; whether the applicant has submitted a complete application and has
secured all certificates and other authorizations required by law in order to
construct and/or operate a system in the manner proposed by the applicant;
whether the applicant is delinquent on any taxes or other obligations owed to
the City, Warren County, Ohio, or the State of Ohio; whether the applicant has
the requisite financial, managerial, and technical ability to fulfill all the
obligations under this chapter and the issuance of a Certificate of
Registration; and any other applicable law.  (Ord. 08-22.  Passed 7-3-08.)
1028.08  DENIAL OF APPLICATION.
   The City Manager may deny an application for a Certificate of Registration
for adequate cause. The City Manager shall provide to the applicant in written
form specific factual findings in support of the decision by the City Manager
to deny the application for a Certificate of Registration. Any decision by the
City Manager to deny an application for a Certificate of Registration is
appealable by the application to the City Council in the manner set forth in
this chapter. 
(Ord. 08-22.  Passed 7-3-08.)
1028.09  EXPIRATION OF CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.
   (a)   Unless terminated by the City at an earlier date, a Certificate of
Registration shall expire three (3) years from the date of issuance by the
City.
   (b)   In the event a provider continues to operate all or any part of the
facilities after the term of a Certificate of Registration, such provider shall
continue to comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and other
laws throughout the period of such continued operation, provided that any such
continued operation shall in no way be construed as a renewal or other
extension of the Certificate of Registration, nor as a limitation on the
remedies, if any, available to the City as a result of such continued operation
after the term, including, but not limited to, damages and restitution. Any
conflict between the issuance of a Certificate of Registration and any other
present or future lawful exercise of the City's regulatory or police powers
shall be resolved in favor of the latter.  (Ord. 08-22.  Passed 7-3-08.)
1028.10  RESPONSIBILITIES OF UTILITY SERVICE PROVIDER WITH  VALID CERTIFICATE
OF REGISTRATION.
   (a)   If the location or proposed location of any element of a public or
private Utility System is in a public Right of Way, then the consent of the
City, evidenced by the issuance by the City of a Revocable Street Privilege
Permit in accordance with Section
1028.32 of this chapter must be obtained by that Utility Service Provider
before the construction, installation, demolition or removal of any element of
the Utility System is permitted or any excavation by that Utility Service
Provider in the public Right of Way is permitted.
     (b)   The provider must keep all the information required in the
application by the City current.
   (c)   When requested by the City, a public or private Utility Service
Provider, with a Utility System element located or proposed to be located in a
public Right of Way in the City, must meet with the City to co-ordinate future
plans for the public Right of Way between the Utility Service Provider and the
City. 
   (d)   A Utility Service Provider with any Utility System element located or
proposed to be located in a Right of Way in the City must provide the City with
up-to-date accurate plans in sufficient detail and in a format acceptable to
the City showing the location of all elements of the Utility System located in
the Right of Way in the City. The City Engineer may in the future adopt
specifications and further define the mapping data requirement(s) under this
Section.  In each instance a Utility Service Provider shall be served with a
copy of the specifications by regular U.S. Mail provided, however, that failure
to actually receive such notice shall not in any way affect the validity or
enforceability of said specifications.
   (e)   In addition to a Certificate of Registration, providers shall obtain
any and all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses
necessary for the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate
Federal, State and local authorities and, upon the City's reasonable request,
shall provide copies of such documents to the City.
   (f)   A Certificate of Registration issued pursuant to this chapter shall
not entitle a provider to use, alter, convert to, or interfere with, the
facilities, easements, poles, conduits, lines, pipelines, wires, fiber, cable,
or any other real or personal property of any kind whatsoever under the
management or control of the City.
   (g)   A Certificate of Registration shall not convey equitable or legal
title in the Right of Way. A Certificate of Registration is only the
nonexclusive, limited right to occupy Right of Way in the City for the limited
purpose and for the limited period stated in the Certificate of Registration
and in accordance with this chapter and any associated permit. For those
providers with a valid gas or electric franchise, the provisions of a
Certificate of Registration shall be deemed as regulatory in nature and shall
not be interpreted to limit the right to occupy the Right of Way which may have
been granted by such franchise.  The rights to occupy the Right of Way itself
may not be subdivided or subleased, provided, however, that two or more
providers may collocate facilities in the same area of the Right of Way so long
as each such provider complies with the provisions of this chapter. A
Certificate of Registration does not excuse a provider from obtaining
appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before collocating its
facilities on facilities of others, including the City's facilities. A
Certificate of Registration does not prevent a provider from leasing space in
or on the provider's system, so long as the sharing of facilities does not
cause a violation of law, including the provisions of this chapter. A
Certificate of Registration does not excuse a provider from complying with any
provisions of this chapter and other applicable law.
   (h)  A Utility Service Provider with any Utility System Elements located in
a Right of Way shall maintain such Elements, including but not limited to
repainting over any graffiti.
(Ord. 08-22.  Passed 7-3-08.)
1028.11  CITY STANDARDS.
   As part of City required standards wherever Rights of Way are under
construction, if deemed advisable and practicable by the City Manager, the City
may install all such facilities deemed necessary to accommodate future provider
needs. Any such installed facilities shall be City property and may be conveyed
to any person under such terms and conditions as are deemed advisable by the
City Manager. 
(Ord. 08-22.  Passed 7-3-08.)
1028.12  RELOCATION OF EQUIPMENT.
   (a)    Within a time designated by the City Engineer and not less than
thirty (30) days following written notice from the City, the person that owns
the facility or related elements shall, at its own expense, temporarily or
permanently remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any facilities
within the public ways whenever the City shall have determined that such
removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably necessary for any of
the following:
      (1)   The construction, repair, maintenance or installation of any City
or other public improvement in or upon the public ways.
      (2)   The operations of the City or other governmental entity in or upon
the public ways.  If the permit holder or owner fails to remove, relocate,
change or alter the facility within the time designated, the City may, at its
option, either have such relocation, removal, change or alterations performed
and bill the owner for such costs, or bill the owner for increased costs
incurred as a result of such failure.
    (b)   No Utility Service Provider shall be required to bear the expense of
removal, relocation, change or alteration of position of any Facilities if such
requirement would be prohibited by law.
(Ord. 08-22.  Passed 7-3-08.)
1028.13  DAMAGE TO OTHER EQUIPMENT.
   (a)   When the City does or causes to be done work in the Right of Way and
finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move a provider's equipment to
protect it, the City Manager shall notify the local representative as early as
is reasonably possible. The costs associated therewith will be billed to that
provider and must be paid within thirty days from the date of billing.
   (b)   Each provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
equipment in the Right of Way which it or its equipment damages. Each provider
shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the equipment of
another provider caused during the City's response to an emergency occasioned
by that provider's equipment.
(Ord. 08-22.  Passed 7-3-08.)
1028.14  RIGHT OF WAY VACATION.
   (a)   If the City vacates a Right of Way which contains the equipment of a
provider, and if the vacation does not require the relocation of the provider's
equipment, the City shall reserve, to and for itself and all providers having
equipment in the vacated Right of Way, the right to install, maintain and
operate any equipment in the vacated Right of Way and to enter upon such Right
of Way at any time for the purpose of reconstructing, inspecting, maintaining
or repairing the same.
   (b)   If the vacation requires the relocation of the provider's equipment;
and:
      (1)   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the provider, the
provider must pay the relocation costs; or
      (2)   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the City, the provider
must pay the relocation costs unless otherwise agreed to by the City and the
provider; or
      (3)   If the vacation proceedings are initiated by a person or persons
other than the provider, such other person or persons must pay the relocation
costs.  (Ord. 08-22.  Passed 7-3-08.)
1028.15  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS; ABANDONED EQUIPMENT; REMOVAL.
   (a)   Discontinued Operations.  A provider who has determined to discontinue
its operations in the City must either:
      (1)   Provide information satisfactory to the City Manager that the
provider's obligations for its equipment in the Right of Way under this chapter
have been lawfully assumed by another provider; or
      (2)   Submit to the City Manager a proposal and instruments for
transferring ownership of its equipment to the City. If a provider proceeds
under this clause, the City may, at its option: purchase the equipment; require
the provider, at its own expense, to remove it; or require the provider to post
a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the City for reasonably anticipated
costs to be incurred in removing the equipment.
   (b)   Abandoned Equipment.  Equipment of a provider who fails to comply with
the discontinued operations provisions of this chapter and which remains unused
shall be deemed to be abandoned. Unused equipment means facilities located in
the Right of Way which have remained unused for a period of two years and for
which the provider is unable to:  (i) provide the City with a credible plan
detailing the procedure by which the provider intends to begin actively using
such facilities within the next twelve months; or (ii) that it has a potential
purchaser or user of the facilities who will be actively using the facilities
within the next twelve months; or (iii) that the availability of such
facilities is required by the provider to adequately and efficiently operate
its system. Abandoned equipment is deemed to be a nuisance. The City may
exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not
limited to: (i) abating the nuisance; (ii) taking possession of the equipment
and restoring it to a useable condition; or (iii) requiring removal of the
equipment by the provider, or the provider's successor in interest.
   (c)    Removal.  Any provider who has unused and abandoned equipment in any
Right of Way shall remove it from that Right of Way during the next scheduled
excavation, or at such different time as designated by the City Manager, unless
this requirement is waived by the City Manager.

right-of-way and subject to the provisions of this chapter must provide the
City forty-eight (48) hours notice prior to beginning such work.  Provided,
however, in the event of unexpected repair or emergency work, a person required

applicant and payment of the permit fees required by this chapter, the City
Engineer, if satisfied that the applications, plans and documents comply with
all requirements of this chapter, shall issue a Revocable Street Privilege
Permit authorizing work in the right-of-way, subject to such further

      (2)   The permit shall expire one hundred and twenty (120) days from the
date of issuance unless otherwise specified on the permit.  An additional
permit fee equal to the original permit fee will be assessed for any work not

the permit.
      (3)   Upon the issuance of a Revocable Street Privilege Permit under this
chapter, the City reserves the right to require a pre-construction meeting, the
submission of a construction schedule, and/or the submission of a traffic
control plan demonstrating the protective measures and devices that will be
employed are consistent with the Ohio Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices, latest edition, to prevent injury or damage to persons or property and
to minimize disruptions to efficient pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
      (4)   All permit holders are required to cooperate with the City and with
each other.  All construction, locations, activities and schedules shall be
coordinated, as ordered by the City Engineer, to minimize public inconvenience,
disruption or damages.
      (5)   All construction practices and activities shall be in accordance

authorized representative of such person if it is a business entity.  The
permit holder shall relocate any facilities which are not located in compliance
with permit requirements.
(Ord. 08-22.  Passed 7-3-08.)
1028.33  WORK PERFORMED UNDER REVOCABLE STREET PRIVILEGE PERMITS.
   (a)   Upon order of the City Engineer, all work which does not comply with
the Revocable Street Privilege Permit, the approved plans and specifications
for the work, or the requirements of this chapter, shall be removed.
   (b)   The permit holder shall promptly complete all construction activities
so as to minimize disruption of the public ways and other public and private
property.  All construction work authorized by a permit within the public ways,
including restoration, must be completed in a time period established by the

   (c)   Within sixty (60) days after completion of construction, the permit
holder shall furnish the City with one (1) complete set of plans certified to

improvements, fixtures, structures and facilities, which were damaged during
the course of construction, as nearly as practicable to their condition before
the start of construction.
      (1)   If weather or other conditions do not permit the complete
restoration required by this section, the permit holder shall temporarily
restore the affected public ways or property in accordance with standards
established by the City.  Such temporary restoration shall be at the permit
holder's sole expense and the permit holder shall  undertake and complete the
required permanent restoration when the weather or other conditions no longer
prevent such permanent restoration.
      (2)   A permit holder or other person acting on its behalf shall use
suitable barricades, flags, flagmen, lights, flares and other measures as

as nearly as may be practicable, to the condition existing prior to performance
of work.
              (1)       A Utility Service Provider must have a valid
Certificate of Registration on file with the City, before the City may issue a
Revocable Street Privilege Permit.
      (2)   When practical, in the opinion of the City, the policy of the City
is to require the underground location of a new Utility System element.
      (3)   The construction, demolition or removal of any element of a Utility
System in a public Right of Way by a Utility Service Provider must be
accomplished in a practical manner which, in the opinion of the City, results
in the least potential amount of damage and disruption of the public Right of
Way.
      (4)   The applicant shall provide a specific timetable for the permit
work to be accomplished within, detailed plans, accurate scale drawings, and
specifications in sufficient detail acceptable to the City to describe the area
of work covered in the permit application. In addition, the City may require
the applicant to provide up-to-date, accurate, comprehensive master plans of
the existing and proposed Utility System. These master plans are intended to
allow the City to consider the broader context of the Utility Service
Provider's plans upon which the permit application is based.
         (Ord. 08-22.  Passed 7-3-08.)
1028.34  LIMITATIONS ON PLACEMENT.
   (a)   The City requires Utility Systems Elements to be in locations that:
      (1)   Contribute to the public health, safety, welfare or economic
development of the City.
      (2)   Promote cooperation among Revocable Street Privilege Permit holders
and the City in the occupation of the Right of Way in order to minimize public
inconveniences during Right of Way work and to reduce wasteful, unnecessary or
unsightly duplication or installation, operation and maintenance of Utility
Systems, including, without limitation, the impacts of the proposed location of
applicant's Utility System Elements on aesthetic and architectural
compatibility with the surrounding environment.
      (3)   Promote public health, safety and welfare and protect the Right of
Way and Public Property in the most efficient, most aesthetic, visually
enhancing and least obtrusive manner, including, without limitation, that all
applicable building and zoning codes and air and water pollution laws and
regulations are complied with, that aesthetic and good planning principles have
been given due consideration, and that adverse impact on the environment has
been minimized in addition to minimizing the adverse aesthetic and visual
impacts on the land, property, buildings, and other Facilities adjacent to,
surrounding, and in generally the same area as the requested location, which
shall mean using the least visually and physically intrusive Utility System
(including associated screening or vegetation) that is not technologically or
commercially impracticable under the facts and circumstances.
          (b)    To protect the public health, safety, and welfare in
recognition of the limitation of space in the public Right of Way, the City
Manager shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of a new
Utility System or additional elements of an existing Utility System within a
public Right of Way if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the
requests of persons to occupy and use the public Right of Way. In making such
decisions, the City Manager shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate
all existing and potential users of the public Right of Way, but shall be
guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public's needs
for the particular utility service, the condition of the public Right of Way,
the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of
existing elements of Utility Systems in the public Right of Way, and future
City plans for public improvements and development projects which have been
determined to be in the public interest.
   (c)   The City Manager may deny a permit to protect the public health,
safety and welfare, to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of
ordinary travel over the public Right of Way, or when necessary to protect the
public Right of Way and its users.  The City Manager, in his or her discretion,
may consider one of more of the following factors: the extent to which public
Right of Way space where the permit is sought is available; the competing
demands for the particular space in the Right of Way; the availability of other
locations in the public Right of Way or in other public Right of Way for the
Utility System elements of the permit applicant; the applicability of ordinance
or other regulations of the Right of Way that affect location of Utility System
elements in the Right of Way; the degree of compliance of the applicant  with
the terms and conditions of its franchise, this chapter, and other applicable
ordinances and regulations; the degree of disruption to surrounding communities
and businesses that will result from the use of that part of the public Right
of Way; the condition and age of the public Right of Way, and whether and when
it is scheduled for total or partial reconstruction; the balancing of the costs
of disruption to the public and damage to the public Right of Way, against the
benefits to that part of the public served by the expansion into additional
parts of the public Right of Way; and the feasibility of accomplishing the
desired goal outside of the public Right of Way.
(Ord. 08-22.  Passed 7-3-08.)
1028.35  CONSTRUCTION BOND REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Either the owner of the project or the contractor performing the work
on such project shall post sufficient bond to assure that the terms and
conditions of this chapter shall be met, and that the Right-of-Way shall be
properly restored in the form of a surety or maintenance bond, escrow account,
irrevocable letter of credit, or a cash deposit.
   (b)   Any person may post an annual bond, in a form described in subsection
(a) above, in the amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) in lieu of bonds
for individual projects.  The City reserves the right to require a bond in a
greater amount if the restoration of the right-of-way could exceed fifty
thousand dollars ($50,000).
   (c)   Maintenance of work performed in the Rights-of-Way, performed under a
Revocable Street Privilege Permit issued in accordance with this chapter, shall
remain the responsibility of the permit holder for a period of one (1) year
from the date of final inspection, except that period shall be two (2) years
for permits issued for pavement cuts or borings under the pavement.  A
sufficient maintenance bond, in an amount determined by the City Engineer,
shall be kept during this period. When applicable, the City may utilize all or
a portion of the bond required in subsection (b) above for the maintenance
bond.

This definition of Substantial Change applies to installations in the public
right of way.  The thresholds for a substantial change outlined above are
disjunctive.  The failure to meet any one or more of the applicable thresholds
means that a substantial change would occur.  The thresholds for height
increases are cumulative limits.  For sites with horizontally separated
deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the originally-permitted
wireless support structure without regard to any increases in size due to
wireless facilities not included in the original design.  For sites with
vertically separated deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the

collocate or remove a small cell facility or construct, maintain, modify,
operate, replace, or remove wireless support structures in, along, across,
upon, and/or under the Right of Way shall be classified as one of three types. 
The three types of applications are:
      (1)   Small Cell Minor - An application that:
         A.   Involves removal or replacement of small cell facilities and any
associated equipment on an existing wireless support; and such removal or
replacement does not  constitute a substantial change; or
         B.   Involves the routine maintenance of a small cell facility.
      (2)   Small Cell Substantial - An application that:
         A.   Involves the installation of a new small cell facility on a
wireless support structure; or
         B.   Involves the removal or replacement of a small cell facility on
an existing wireless support structure and such removal or replacement
constitutes a substantial change.
      (3)   Wireless Support Structure - An application for a proposal to
construct, modify or replace a wireless support structure in the Right of Way.
   (b)   Applications seeking to collocate a small cell facility to a wireless
support structure owned by the City and located within the City Right of Way
shall also be required to obtain an Attachment Certificate and shall be subject
to an attachment. 
   (c)   Pursuant to R. C. 4939.0312. (A) the City shall permit a person
seeking to construct, modify, collocate, or replace more than one small cell
facility or more than one wireless support structure within the jurisdiction of
a single municipal corporation to file,  at the person's discretion, a
consolidated application for consent for up to thirty small cell facilities
requests in a single application or up to thirty wireless support structure
requests in a single application and receive a single permit for the
construction, modification, collocation, or replacement of the small cell
facilities or wireless support structures. However, this single application may
only address multiple small cell facilities or multiple wireless support
structures if they each involve substantially the same type of small cell
facilities or substantially the same type of wireless support structures. The

   (b)   Location.
      (1)   In accordance with ORC 4939.0314(D), Authority of a Municipal
Corporation, the City shall reserve the right to propose an alternate location
to the proposed location of a new wireless support structure, provided the
alternate location is within 100' or a distance equal to the width of the Right
of Way in or on which the new wireless support structure is proposed, whichever
is greater.  The City also finds that certain locations and collocation
configurations are preferred.  A preferred location and collocation
configuration should be utilized whenever possible and should only be surpassed
if in the determination of the City Manager, clear and convincing evidence
supports such a decision.  Cost alone should not be grounds for such a
determination. The order of preference is as follows:
         A.   First, small cell facilities should be collocated on an existing
pole or wireless support structure within a utility easement.  If no such pole
or wireless support structure is available then proceed to the next preference;
         B.   Second, small cell facilities should be collocated on an existing
pole or wireless support structure within an alley.  If no such pole or

City Right of Way.  If no such wireless support structure is available then
proceed to the next preference;
         F.   Sixth, small cell facilities should be collocated on an existing
pole located within the City Right of Way.  If no such existing pole is
available then proceed to the next preference;
         G.   Seventh, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within a utility easement.  If no such
location is available then proceed to the next preference;
         H.   Eighth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within an alley.  If no such location is
available then proceed to the next preference
         I.   Ninth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within the City Right of Way.
      (2)   New wireless support structures shall be spaced from other small
cell facilities consistent with the average spacing of the existing utility

            1.   The design features of nearby poles serving in a similar
capacity;
            2.   The design features of the existing or proposed streetscape,
district, or site;
            3.   The historical context of a district, Historic Property or
specific site;
      (2)   Small cell facilities and micro wireless facilities shall be
subject to the following design standards:
         A.   The City reserves the right to require the following:
            1.   Antenna and all associated equipment shall be concealed to the
extent deemed necessary by the City Manager in response to the aesthetic
context of the small cell facility.  Some possible configurations include but
shall not be limited to the following:
               a.   Antenna(s) associated with the first fitting on a wireless
support structure shall be top-mounted and concealed within a radome that also
conceals the cable connections, antenna mount and other hardware.  The City
Manager may approve a side-mounted antenna with the initial fitting if, in the
City Manager's discretion, the side-mounted antenna would be a better match to
the aesthetics and character of the immediate area and would promote the
purposes of this Chapter.
               b.   GPS antennas be placed within the radome or directly above
the radome not to exceed six inches.
         B.   Each Antenna and all associated equipment shall not exceed 6
cubic feet in volume.

inches in depth;
            3.   Not extend more than 24 inches away from the pole on which it
is mounted;
            4.   Shall be centered on the vertical axis of the pole to which it
is mounted;
            5.   Be mounted at a distance of at least 10 feet measured from
grade to the bottom of the enclosure;
            6.   Be mounted on the side of the pole facing away from nearest
traffic lane's direction of travel.
         E.   Such common enclosures shall have the following design elements:
            1.   Material - The enclosure material shall be metal, a composite,
or an equivalent material as determined by the City Manager.
            2.   Color - The enclosure shall match the color of the pole on
which it is mounted.
            3.   Style - The enclosure shall match the style of the pole on
which it is mounted.
            4.   Coordinated Design Elements - Common enclosures shall match
the material, color, and style of nearby existing common enclosures when:
               a.   Such enclosures are located within 5000' of an existing
common enclosure; and
               b.   Such enclosures are mounted on wireless support structures
of a similar or matching design.
            5.   Exception - If the aesthetics and character of the immediate
area would be better matched by an enclosure a different material, color,
style, or by deviating from the design of a nearby existing common enclosure as
determined by the City Manager, then such design elements may be substituted
with an alternate design element.  Such determination shall be based on the
following factors:
               a.   The design features of nearby poles serving in a similar
capacity;
               b.   The design features of the existing or proposed
streetscape, district, or site;
               c.   The historical context of a district, Historic Property or
specific site;
               d.   A desire to camouflage or conceal the enclosure from view.
         F.   All ground mounted equipment shall be placed in an underground
vault in areas that are designated solely for underground utilities for all
structures and facilities in the right of way. A waiver of this provision may
be granted by the City Manager if the following applies:
            1.   The applicant has submitted clear and convincing evidence that
the equipment cannot feasibly be pole-mounted or place in a location in the
public right of way where the above ground prohibition does not apply, placed
in an underground vault, or hidden within or integrated into an existing
streetscape element (i.e. - bus stop shelter).  Increased costs alone shall not
be a consideration.  If a ground mounted enclosure is approved, the City
Manager shall reserve the right to require any of the following conditions:
               a.   Concealed Enclosure - All equipment shall be completely
concealed within a metal, composite, or equivalent material enclosure as
determined by the City Manager.
               b.   Smallest Size - The enclosure shall be no larger than
necessary based on the smallest available size of the proposed equipment as
determined by the City Manager.
               c.   Camouflage - Camouflaging elements may be required.  Such
elements may include, but shall not be limited to, public art displayed on the
enclosure, strategic placement in less visible or obtrusive locations,
placement within an existing streetscape element, landscape screening, and
strategic painting or coating to camouflage such enclosure or equipment.
            2.   The maximum height of any such enclosure shall be 30".
1032.05.3 Reservation of Right of Way
   The City reserves the right to Reserve space for future public safety or
transportation uses in the Right of Way or on a wireless support structure or
pole owned or operated by the City in a documented and approved plan in place
at the time an application is filed.  A reservation of space shall not preclude
placement of a pole or collocation of a small cell facility.  If replacement of
the City's pole or wireless support structure is necessary to accommodate the
collocation of the small cell facility and the future use, the small cell
facility operator shall pay for the replacement of the pole or wireless support
structure, and the replaced pole or wireless support structure must accommodate
the future use.
   The City Manager is authorized to make requests and to issue orders

1042.10 relevant to the type of tap-in proposed; plus
      (2)    A sum per front foot of the property abutting and abounding the
water system extension, such sum to be determined by the Engineer and to be an
estimated front foot cost (including all expenses relative to the water system
extension listed in Ohio R.C. 727.08) to construct a six-inch water main
extension, provided that each property shall be charged on the basis of a front
footage of 100 feet or the actual footage abutting and abounding the water
system extension, whichever is greater, and provided, further, that if the
water system extension abuts or abounds the property on more than one side,
then the property shall be charged on the basis of a front footage of 100 feet
or the actual footage on the longest side of the property that abuts or abounds
the water system improvement, whichever is greater; plus
      (3)    If the property is subdivided after the construction of the water
main extension, the Engineer shall add to the cost of the tap-in fee the actual
construction cost (including all expenses relative to the project listed in
Ohio R.C. 727.08) of any oversizing of the water system beyond that covered in
paragraph (c)(2) hereof required for the overall efficient operation of the
Municipal water system, as determined by the Engineer, plus interest on such
costs at the rate of eight percent per year, computed from the date the
Municipality borrows money from such costs or pays a contractor any portion of
the cost of such oversizing (whichever date is earlier) to the date of payment
of the tap-in fee.
         (Ord. 942. Passed 3-19-81; Ord. 1010. Passed 1-21-82.)
1042.16  PAYMENT OF TAP-IN FEES.
   The fees required by Sections
1042.10,
1042.11 and
1042.15 are due and payable when a request for water service and a tap into the
Municipal water system is filed with the appropriate official of the
Municipality. The proper payment must accompany and be submitted with such a
request for service, provided, however, that payment may be made in accordance
with the provisions of this section.
   If the circumstances described in Section
1042.15(b) exist, then the fee required hereunder may be deferred and made
payable in quarterly installments, provided that the owner of the property to
be served signs an agreement with the Municipality in accordance with the
following terms:
   (a)    The Director of Service shall file or cause to be filed in the
miscellaneous records or other records, if applicable, of the County Recorder,
for each property to which the conditions of Section
1042.15(b) apply, a statement that the terms of this section and Section
1042.15 are applicable if the owner of such property requests a tap into the
Municipally owned water system.  Such filing shall be made within ten days
after the adoption by Council of a resolution to accept contractors' bids for
the construction of any extension of the water system to the properties that
abut, abound or are potentially served thereby, provided, however, that failure
to make such filing shall in no way affect the duties and obligations arising
from subsections (b) through (l) hereof.
   (b)    All agreements for deferred payments of the fee required hereunder
shall accompany the request for water service and shall state the number of
years over which the payments are to extend, provided that no payments shall
extend beyond twenty years from the date of filing the request with the
appropriate official of the Municipality.
   (c)    The principal amount of the deferred fee (unless paid in full under
subsection (d) hereof shall be paid in substantially equal quarterly amounts,
with the conditions that the initial payment must be made prior to the permit
being issued and that the same must be at least equal to the basic fee set out
in Section
1042.15(c)(1).
   (d)    The unpaid principal amount of the deferred fee may be prepaid in
full at any time at the option of the property owner, without penalty, and upon
prepayment in full, all interest charges, as provided in subsection (e) hereof
shall cease.
   (e)    Interest on the outstanding principal amount of the deferred fee
shall be computed at the lower of the rate of ten and one-half percent per
year, or a rate equal to the average prime rate charged by the banks located in
the Municipality, provided that the interest shall be determined at the time of
the filing of the agreement provided for in this section and such rate of
interest shall not be altered for the life of the agreement.
   (f)    Billings for both principal and interest shall be added to the
quarterly water service billing of the Municipality.
   (g)    Water service shall be terminated by the Municipality to any property
for which the quarterly charges required hereunder are not paid within thirty
days.
   (h)    If the owner of any property subject to the provisions of this
section sells, conveys or otherwise transfers such property, he or she shall,
prior to such sale, conveyance or transfer, either pay the then outstanding
principal amount of the deferred charges required under this section, plus
accrued interest, or present to the appropriate Municipal official an
agreement, as provided in this section, signed by the new or prospective owner
of the property, requesting the continuation of the deferred payments for the
remainder of the original period, in accordance with the terms and conditions

point onward and is based upon the basic consideration that the oversizing of
lines throughout the Municipality is necessitated by the growth which is
occurring in and around the Municipality due to developers subdividing existing
land and developing it. Council feels that the resultant oversizing charges are
most equitably borne by those developers in those situations and, where
additional growth is not caused by existing residences and businesses, that the

cooling water or unpolluted industrial process water to any sanitary sewer.
   (b)    Storm water and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to
such sewers as are specifically designated as storm sewers, or to a natural
outlet approved by the Inspector. Industrial cooling water or unpolluted
process water may be discharged, on approval of the Inspector and upon the
issuance of an N.P.D.E.S. permit, to a storm sewer or natural outlet.
   (c)    No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the
following described waters or wastes into any public sewer:
      (1)    Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil or other flammable or
explosive material or volatile liquid;
      (2)    Any water or waste containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids
or gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other
wastes, to injure or interfere with any sewage treatment process, constitute a
hazard to humans or animals or create a public nuisance or a hazard in
receiving waters of the sewage treatment plan, including, but not limited to,
cyanides in excess of two mg/l as a cyanide ion in the wastes as discharged to
the public sewer; 
      (3)    Any water or waste having a pH lower than 6.0 or greater than 9.0

Municipality for such materials;
      (6)    Any water or waste containing phenols or other toxic or odor-
producing substances, in such concentrations as exceed limits which may be
established by the Municipality as necessary, after treatment of the composite
sewage, to meet the requirements of the State, Federal or other public agencies
of jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters;
      (7)    Any radioactive waste or isotope of such half-life or
concentration as may exceed established limits in compliance with applicable
State or Federal regulations;
      (8)    Materials which exert or cause:
         A.    Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but
not limited to, Fullers earth, lime slurries and lime residues) or of dissolved
solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate);
         B.    Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes
and vegetable tanning solutions);
         C.    Unusual BOD, COD or chlorine requirements in such quantities as
to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment works; or
         D.    An unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes
constituting "slugs; " or
      (9)    Any water or waste containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
   (e)    If any water or waste is discharged, or is proposed to be discharged,
to the public sewers, which water or waste contains the substances or possesses
the characteristics enumerated in subsection (d) hereof, and which may have a
deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or receiving
waters, or which otherwise creates a hazard to life or constitutes a public
nuisance, the Municipality may:
      (1)    Reject the wastes;
      (2)    Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public  sewers;
      (3)    Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
      (4)    Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under subsection (j)
hereof.
   If the Municipality permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows,
then the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject
to the review and approval of the Municipality and to the requirements of all
applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
   (f)    Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when they are
necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in
excessive amounts or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients.
However, such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or
dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by
the Municipality and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible
for cleaning and inspection.
   (g)    Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are
provided for any water or waste, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his or her expense.
   (h)    When required by the Municipality, the owner of any property serviced
by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer as are needed to facilitate the observation, sampling and
measurement of wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the Municipality. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his or her
expense and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible at
all times.
   (i)    All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater," published by the American Public Health Association, or
otherwise, by Environmental Protection Agency approved methods and shall be
determined at the control manhole provided or upon suitable samples taken at
such manhole. If no special manhole has been required, the control manhole
shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to
the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried
out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon
the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and
property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four
hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab
sample should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids
analyses are obtained from twenty-four hour composites of all outfalls where pH
is determined from periodic grab samples.
   (j)    Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as preventing
any special agreement or arrangement between the Municipality and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the Municipality for treatment, subject to the payment of a
surcharge based on the strength and character of the waste, provided such
payment is in accordance with Federal and State guidelines for user charge
systems and industrial cost recovery systems.
   (k)    The Municipality shall have the right to reject any industrial waste
which may not be compatible with the treatment process or the sewage works. The
Municipality further has the right to require pretreatment of industrial
wastes, if deemed necessary, and to impose a surcharge commensurate with any
added difficulty or added direct cost associated with an industrial waste.
   (l)   A system of industrial cost recovery, in accordance with Section
1044.13, shall be instituted by the Municipality prior to the acceptance of any
industrial waste.
   (m)    As a safeguard to public health, the following notification
procedures shall apply in the event of an accidental spill. Any industrial user
shall notify the City Manager immediately upon the occurrence of a "slug", load
or accidental discharge of a substance prohibited by this section or applicable
State or Federal law. The initial notification shall include at a minimum the
following information: location of the discharge, date and time of the
discharge, material discharged, concentration, volume discharged and any
corrective action already taken.
   These reports shall be confirmed in writing within five days of the
discharge and submitted on the City Accident Spill Form to the City Manager.
Failure to report shall be grounds for revocation of an industrial waste permit
and termination of sewer service.
   Any industrial user who discharges a slug load of prohibited materials shall
be liable for any expense, loss or damage to the municipal sewer system, in
addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the Authority or account thereof
under State or Federal law.
   Signs shall be posted by the industrial user in conspicuous places on the
industrial user's premises, advising employees when to call in the event of a
slug or accidental discharge to the municipal sewer system. Employers shall
instruct all employees who may cause or discover such discharge with respect to
emergency notification procedures and countermeasure actions.
   (n)    Discharge reporting requirements are hereby established for extra
strength industrial users in the Municipality. All extra strength industrial
users are hereby required to submit an industrial permits report in compliance
with applicable Federal and State discharge reporting requirements to the
Municipality. (Ord. 93-71. Passed 11-4-93.)

(Ord. 03-42.  Passed 8-21-03.)
1044.11  WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES; MEASUREMENT OF FLOW; SURCHARGES.
   (a)    Basis for Wastewater Service Charges.  The wastewater service charge
for the use of, and for services supplied by, the Municipal wastewater
collection and treatment system, shall consist of a charge for collection and a
charge for treatment. Such charges shall be established to defray the cost of
administration, operation, maintenance, major replacement and debt service.
   (b)    Collection System Charges.  The collection system charge shall
consist of a minimum charge plus a use charge based on flow.
   (c)    Treatment System Charges.  The treatment system charge for normal
domestic sewage and for discharges that are less than 600 mg/l COD and less
than 225 mg/l suspended solids and that contain no incompatible pollutants
shall consist of a flow charge.
   The treatment system charge for wastewater that is greater than 600 mg/l COD
or greater than 225 mg/l suspended solids or that has a rate of discharge
greater than 25,000 gallons per day shall consist of a flow charge, a surcharge
and/or an industrial cost recovery charge, as applicable.
   The surcharge shall consist of a cost per pound in excess of the limits
stated in this subsection as determined by the amount of increased cost to the
system to treat these flows. Other waste characteristics shall be surcharged if
they increase the cost of wastewater treatment in excess of that for the
treatment of normal sewage. Such surcharges shall be determined by the Engineer
in accordance with applicable Federal standards.
   (d)    Review of Wastewater Service Charges.  The adequacy of the charge
system shall be reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary in order to
collect sufficient revenues to administer, operate and maintain the system, to
retire the debt and to build a replacement fund as defined by the Federal Water
Pollution Control Act, as amended.
   (e)    Measurement of Flow.
      (1)    The volume of flow used for computing user charges and surcharges
shall, to the extent practical, be the metered water consumption.
      (2)    If the user discharging wastes into the public sewers procures any
part or all of his, her or its water from sources other than the public water
works system, all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, he,
she or it shall install and maintain, at his, her or its own expense, water
meters of a type approved by the Municipality for the purpose of determining
the volume of water obtained from such other sources.
      (3)    Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be
required by the Municipality if such volume cannot otherwise be determined from
the metered water consumption records.
      (4)    Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned and maintained by the Municipality or by a party designated by
the Municipality.
   (f)   Computation of Surcharges.  The concentration of wastes used for
computing surcharges shall be established by waste sampling. Waste sampling
shall be performed as often as may be deemed necessary by the Municipality or
its representative and shall be binding as a basis for surcharges.
   (g)    Computation of Wastewater Service Charges.  The wastewater service
charge shall be computed by the following formula:
      Wastewater Service Charge =
      M + Q (UC) + SUR + ICR
where:    M = System minimum charge per billing period
      Q = Billing period flow
      UC = User charge for operation, maintenance and replacement
      SUR= Surcharge
      ICR = Industrial cost recovery charge (Ord. 88-10. Passed 2-4-88.)
   (h)    Establishment of Charges.  The charges referenced in this subsection
are established as the charges for the Municipal collection and treatment
system. Wastewater service charges for the period beginning with the May 1,
1988 meter reading as reflected on the monthly billing issued in June, 1988,
shall be as set forth in
Appendix A of Chapter
1464 of the Building and Housing Code of the Codified Ordinances.
   Due to the increase of the City income tax, wastewater charges to the
resident and nonresident users shall be those charges as set forth in such
Appendix A of Chapter
1464.
   Users outside the City shall be charged an additional surcharge as set forth
in such
Appendix A of Chapter
1464 in addition to the rates established herein.
(Ord. 93-46. Passed 7-1-93.)
   (i)    Operation, Maintenance and Recovery Costs.  Each user shall pay their
proportionate share of operation, maintenance and recovery costs. Each user
shall be notified at least annually, in conjunction with the regular billing
statement, of the rate and portion of the sewer service charge which is
attributable to Operation, Maintenance and Recovery cost for wastewater
treatment services. (Ord. 93-69. Passed 11-4-93.)
1044.12  OVERSIZING CHARGES.
   (a)    Oversizing charges, as determined by the Engineer, on sewer lines
installed in the future in the Municipality or territories served by the
Municipal sewerage system, shall be assessed as follows:
      (1)    Residential properties which are to be assessed for the cost of
the project shall have the oversizing charges paid for by the Municipality upon
the receipt by the Municipality of an agreement signed by the property owner
and deemed appropriate by the Law Director, which shall, in essence, require
the property owner to repay the Municipality such oversizing charges and
appropriate interest if and when the property in question is subdivided or
split in the future.
      (2)    Commercial and retail property owners shall be treated in the same
manner as residential property owners.
      (3)    Developers of property which has been subdivided in the
Municipality shall assume the full cost of the mains which the Municipality
deems appropriate through that area, including any oversizing charges which
might be involved.
   (b)    This section shall represent the policy of the Municipality from this
point onward and is based upon the basic consideration that the oversizing of
lines throughout the Municipality is necessitated by the growth which is
occurring in and around the Municipality due to developers subdividing existing
land and developing it. Council feels that the resultant oversizing charges are
most equitably borne by those developers in those situations and, where
additional growth is not caused by existing residences and businesses, that the
oversizing charges on those properties are best borne by the Municipality as a
whole. (Res. 319. Passed 12-21-78.)
1044.13  INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY.
   (a)    Application.  This section shall not be applicable unless
specifically required by the Regional Administrator of the Federal
Environmental Protection Agency and shall be subject to revision at that time
to meet the Federally mandated minimum requirements at that time.
   (b)    Industrial Cost Recovery Required.  Industrial users shall pay that
portion of any Federal grant which has been obtained by the district for
financing the construction of wastewater treatment works allocable to the
treatment of the wastewater from such user. Such user's share shall not include
an interest component. Any industrial user discharging less than the equivalent
of 25,000 gallons per day or less of sanitary waste shall be exempt from
industrial cost recovery obligations, provided that such discharge does not
contain pollutants which:
      (1)    Interfere with treatment works processes;
      (2)    Are toxic or incompatible; or
      (3)    Contaminate or otherwise reduce the utility of the sludge.
   (c)    Costs for Industrial Users.  The cost to be recovered from an
industrial user shall be computed by first determining the percentages of each
applicable capital cost item which is primarily flow-sensitive, suspended
solid-sensitive or COD-sensitive. Such percentages are then multiplied by the
fraction of the above components of each industry, based on its average daily
contribution during the past year, to determine its overall share of each
applicable capital cost item.
   (d)    Charges for Industrial Cost Recovery.  Every year during the
industrial cost recovery period, each industrial user of the treatment works
shall pay the cost recovery amount determined by subsection (c) hereof, for
such industry, divided by the number of years in the recovery period. Where an
industry is connected to a public sewer after the start-up of the facilities
constructed under a Federal grant, such industry shall only pay its portion of
the grant for each month remaining in the recovery period. Such industry shall
not be required to pay for that part of the recovery period prior to its
connection to a public sewer.
   (e)    Length of Industrial Cost Recovery Period.  The industrial cost
recovery period shall be equal to the useful life of the treatment works or
thirty years from the acceptance of the works from the contractor, whichever is
less.
   (f)   Payments and Billing Period.  For the purpose of industrial cost
recovery, the year shall be divided into monthly periods. All industrial users
of the facility shall pay the cost, as determined by subsection (d) hereof, for
industrial cost recovery. Such payments shall be made concurrently with the
normal monthly billing for which service has been supplied. Such charge shall
be immediately due and payable. If such bills are not paid within thirty days,
a service charge of one and one-half percent per month shall be added thereto.
   (g)    Delinquency and Termination of Service.  If the charges for
industrial cost recovery are not paid within ninety days after the rendition of
the bill, then such charges shall be deemed and are hereby declared to be
delinquent. Thereafter, such delinquent charges shall constitute a lien upon
the real estate for which such sewer services were supplied and shall be
certified to the County Auditor for collection. If the charges for industrial
cost recovery are not paid within 180 days, the Municipality shall discontinue
service after ten days notice.
   (h)    Time of First Payment.  The initial payment made by an industrial
user, which is connected to a public sewer after the start-up of the treatment
works constructed with a Federal grant, shall be made by the next scheduled due
date, as set forth in Section
1044.14 , and shall be equal to one-twelfth of the amount as determined by
subsection (d) hereof.
   (i)    Adjustment of Charges Due to Strength of Volume Changes.  If there is
a change in the strength and/or volume introduced into the treatment works by
an industrial user, as determined by the records of the previous year, the
user's future portion of any Federal grant shall be adjusted accordingly.
   (j)    Adjustment of Charge Due to Plant Improvement Utilizing Federal Grant
Funds. If there is an expansion or upgrading of the treatment works utilizing a
Federal grant, each existing industrial user's share shall be adjusted to the
extent to which such upgrading or expansion benefits the user.
   (k)    Charges for Unused or Unreserved Capacity.  An industrial user's
portion of any grant shall not include any portion of the grant amount
allocable to unused or reserved capacity.
   (l)   Commitment for Increased Use.  An industrial user's portion of a grant
shall include allowance for the cost of any firm commitment to the Municipality
for any increased use by such user.
   (m)    Payment to U.S. Treasury Required.  The Municipality shall retain
fifty percent of the moneys recovered from industrial users. The remainder,
together with any interest earned thereon, shall be returned to the U.S.
Treasury on an annual basis.
   (n)    Disposition of Detained Amounts.  Eighty percent of the retained
amounts, together with interest earned thereon, shall be used solely for the
eligible costs of the expansion or reconstruction of treatment works associated
with the project and necessary to meet the requirements of the Federal Act. The
Municipality, prior to commitment of the retained amounts, shall obtain the
written approval of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for any expansion
or reconstruction. The remainder of the retained amounts may be used for such
expenditures of the wastewater system as the Municipality deems appropriate.
   (o)    Investment of Retained Amounts Required.  Pending use, the grantee
shall invest the retained amounts for reconstruction and expansion in
obligations of the U.S. Government or obligations guaranteed as to principal
and interest by the U.S. Government or any agency thereof, or shall deposit
such amount in accounts fully collateralized by obligations of the U.S.
Government or by obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by
the U.S. Government or any agency thereof.
   (p)    Records.  The Municipality shall maintain the necessary records for
the determination of each user's share of the costs and shall develop the
billing and collection information as required under this section.
   (q)    Responsibilities of Director of Finance.  The Director of Finance
shall be responsible for the investment and expenditure of all moneys collected
for industrial cost recovery in accordance with this section.
   (r)    Monitoring Required.  The Municipality shall maintain a program of
monitoring industrial user discharges as it deems necessary, provided that any
major contributing industry shall be monitored not fewer than twelve times
annually. All other industrial users shall be monitored at such frequency as is
deemed necessary by the Municipality for the determination of the load of the
industrial user.
   (s)    Appeals.  Industrial users and all other users, or classes of users
subject to the industrial cost recovery requirements of this chapter shall have
the right of administrative appeal regarding the reasonableness of allocations
and assessments imposed under the industrial cost recovery system.
   Grievances shall be submitted in writing to the Engineer. Such submittals
shall clearly and concisely detail the nature of the grievance and the proposed
remedy. On the basis of facts contained in the appeal, and any other pertinent
information, the Engineer shall, within thirty days, either cause the
industrial cost recovery system to be adjusted appropriately or rule that there
is insufficient cause to necessitate the adjusting of the industrial cost
recovery system.
   In the case of a denial by the Engineer, an appeal shall be directly
transmitted to the Manager, who shall, within thirty days, likewise consider
all pertinent facts and rule accordingly. The  Manager shall be the final
authority in the administrative appeal process.

1226.05  STATE ROUTE 73 ACCESS PLAN.
   (a)   The Access Plan for State Route 73 and I-75 east to State Route 741
was originally created by:
      (1)   The OKI Regional Planning Agency in 1982 ("OKI Study"). Portions of
the Study have been amended and superseded where applicable by:
         A.   Applicable portions of the Mobility Master Plan, prepared by
Woolpert dated November 2001, and adopted by Ordinance #02-13, March 7, 2002
("Woolpert Study").
         B.   The LJB, Inc. Feasibility Study for Access Road State Route 73 TR
22147 dated May 4, 2005 and adopted by the Planning Commission of the City of
Springboro on February 28, 2007.
         C.   The LJB, Inc. State Route 73 at Interstate 75 Interchange
Modification Study dated October 5, 2005 and passed by Resolution R-06-15 dated
April 6, 2006.
   (b)   Collectively the OKI Study, the applicable portions of the Woolpert
Study and the LJB Studies constitute the 73 Thoroughfare Plan for the City of
Springboro.
      (1)   The 73 Thoroughfare Plan defines the location of access points
along 73 as well as defines future, among other things, thoroughfare
development along 73 and adjacent to 73. Developers and property owners shall
be granted access points along the 73 corridor as shown on the 73 Thoroughfare
Plan, whenever development on the affected site is commenced.
      (2)   The only time such access points would not be permitted is when
other parcels have been developed nearby which do not comply with the 73
Thoroughfare Plan, thereby making, in the opinion of the Planning Commission,
the provision of those designated access points in the 73 Thoroughfare Plan not
in the best interest of the City.
      (3)   Those wishing access points different from or in addition to the
access points provided in such 73 Thoroughfare Plan shall have the obligation
to demonstrate to the Planning Commission why such access points should be
provided, supported by appropriate traffic studies prepared by the developer.
The City may also have its own independent traffic study prepared. The cost of
the City Traffic Study shall be paid by the developer. Unless such evidence is
presented, the developer will be denied such access points. Where the developer
can show reason sufficient in the minds of a majority of all members of the
Planning Commission, such access points may be approved during the site plan
review process.
         (Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1226.06  STATE ROUTE 741 ACCESS PLAN.
   The access points for State Route 741 north of State Route 73 were
established during the widening and reprofiling of the road completed in 1999.
No more access points should be approved unless recommended by the City
Engineer and/or approved by the Planning Commission.  (Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-

Landmark, the following procedure shall be followed:
   (a)   The initiation of a proposal for a Historic Preservation District may
be made only by one or more citizens of Springboro, or a City board,
commission, or committee. The initiation of a proposal for a Landmark may be
made only by the property owner or by a majority of the membership of the City
Council.
   (b)   The proposal shall be submitted to the ARB.
   (c)   All known legal or equitable owners of the designated property and
abutting property owners shall be notified by mail of the proposal, and their

of the ARB and the owners' written comments and shall forward them to the City

   (f)   Upon receipt of the Planning Commission's recommendation, the City
Council shall cause an appropriate ordinance to be prepared, shall schedule a
Public Hearing on the proposed legislation, setting forth a date, time and
place, and shall cause written notice to be given to the owner or any person
having a legal or equitable interest in the property being proposed for
designation.
   (g)   The City Council shall give due consideration to the findings and

notify all persons known to have a legal or equitable interest in said
property. The Planning Commission and the ARB shall also be notified.
   (i)   Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, the City Council may at
any time, after conducting a Public Hearing with reasonable advance written
notice being mailed to the affected property owners, rescind by ordinance the
designation of any area, place, building, or structure as a Landmark, Historic
Preservation District or contributing structure within a Historic Preservation

   (j)   The Clerk of Council shall notify any appropriate county and/or state

1230.07  PROCEDURES FOR THE REVIEW OF PROPOSED CHANGES TO PROTECTED PROPERTIES.
   Applications for a certificate of appropriateness shall be approved if the
content is substantially in compliance with the following:
   (a)   The City's Historic Design Standards, adopted pursuant to Section
1230.04(j)(2)B. of this chapter; and
   (b)   The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, set
forth below:
      (1)   A property will be used as it was historically or be given a new
use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces
and spatial relationships.
      (2)   The historic character of a property will be retained and
preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features,
spaces and spatial relationships that characterize a property will be avoided.
      (3)   Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development,
such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties,
will not be undertaken.
      (4)   Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in
their own right will be retained and preserved.
      (5)   Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction
techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property will be
preserved.
      (6)   Deteriorated historic features will be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature will match the old in design, color,
texture and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features will be
substantiated by documentary and physical evidence.
      (7)   Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken
using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic
materials will not be used.
      (8)   Archaeological resources will be protected and preserved in place.
If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken.
      (9)   New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction
will not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that
characterize the property. The new work will be differentiated from the old and
will be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and
proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its
environment.
      (10)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction will be
undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)

the Building Inspector, as prescribed by the ARB.
   (c)   The ARB shall approve or deny an application for a Certificate of

Appropriateness upon finding that:
      (1)   The proposal conforms to the guidelines; or

which would conform to the guidelines, and adhering to the guidelines would
deny the owner a reasonable rate of return on the real property or amount to a
taking of property without just compensation.
   (e)   The Building Inspector shall not issue any permit for the proposed
major change until a Certificate of Appropriateness is granted.
   (f)   In the case of a denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness for

specified times, then the denial of the application will stand.
      (3)   After meeting with the applicant, if the ARB determines that denial
would create a substantial hardship to the applicant, it shall propose a
compromise which relieves the hardship, if it exists.
      (4)   If, after meeting with the applicant, the ARB has not reached a
compromise with the applicant which relieves substantial hardship, then the
applicant may appeal the decision directly to the City Council. Council may
affirm, modify or reverse the Board's decision.
   (g)   In the case of an application for demolition, the ARB may delay a
decision for up to 180 days upon finding that a structure is of such importance

the applicant. Alternate steps to be investigated include, but are not limited
to:

citizens;

(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1240.11  PUBLIC PURPOSE.
   Regulation of the subdivision of land and the attachment of reasonable
conditions to land subdivision is an exercise of valid police power delegated
by the State of Ohio to the City of Springboro.  The developer has the duty of
compliance with reasonable conditions laid down by the Planning Commission and
City Council for design, dedication, improvement and restrictive use of the
land to conform to the physical and economic development of the City and to the
health, safety and general welfare of the future lot owners in the subdivision
and of the community at large. 
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1240.12  VARIANCES, EXCEPTIONS, AND WAIVER OF CONDITIONS.
   (a)   Variances.  Where the Planning Commission finds that extraordinary
hardships or practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with
these Regulations and/or the purposes of these regulations may be served to a
greater extent by an alternative proposal, it may approve variances,
exceptions, and waiver of conditions to these subdivision regulations so that
substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided that
the variance, exception, or waiver conditions shall not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations; and further provided
the Planning Commission shall not approve variances, exceptions, and waiver of
conditions unless it shall make finding based upon the evidence presented to it
in each specific case that:
      (1)   The granting of the variance, exception or waiver of conditions,
will not be detrimental to the public safety, health, or welfare, or injurious
to other property.
      (2)   The conditions upon which the request is based are unique to the
property for which the relief is sought and are not applicable generally to
other property.
      (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of the regulations is carried out.
      (4)   The relief sought will not in any manner vary the provisions of the
Planning and Zoning Code of the City of Springboro or the master plan, except
that those documents may be amended in the manner prescribed by law.
   (b)   Conditions.  In approving variances, exceptions of waivers of
conditions, the Planning Commission may require such conditions as will, in its
judgment, secure substantially the purposes described in Section
1240.03  of these Regulations.
   (c)   Procedures.  A petition for a variance, exception or waiver of
conditions shall be submitted in writing by the subdivider at the time when the
preliminary plat is filed for consideration of the Planning Commission.  The
petition shall state fully the grounds for the application and all of the facts
relied upon by the petitioner.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1240.13  ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   It shall be the duty of the staff of the Planning Director to enforce
the requirements included in these Regulations and to bring to the attention of
the Law Director any violations of these regulations. No owner, agent of the
owner, of any parcel of land located in a proposed subdivision shall transfer
or sell any part of the parcel before a record plan of the subdivision has been
approved by the Planning Commission in accordance with the provision of the
regulations and filed with the Recorder of Montgomery or Warren County. No
building permit shall be issued for the construction of any building or
structure located on a lot or plat subdivided or sold in violation of the
provisions of these regulations, nor shall the City have any obligation to
issue certificates of occupancy or to extend utility services to any parcel
created in violation of these regulations.
   (b)   Any person who violates any provision of these Regulations shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during on which or which a violation on non-
compliance occurs or continues.
   (c)   Appropriate actions and proceedings may be taken in law or in equity
to prevent any violation of these regulations, to prevent unlawful
construction, to recover damages, to restrain, correct, or abate a violation
and to prevent illegal occupancy of a building structure or premises. These
remedies shall be in addition to the penalties described above.

   (a)   Before the record plan is signed by the City, all applicants shall be
required to complete or provide security for all the street, sanitary sewer,
storm water sewer and other public improvements, including lot improvements, as
required in these regulations and as specified in the record plan approvals by
the Planning Commission. All public improvements shall also be dedicated to the
local government, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (b)   Cash bonds shall be provided in one of the following forms, subject to
approval of the necessary documentation by the City Law Director:
      (1)   By delivery to the City of a certified or cashier's check payable
to the "City of Springboro, Ohio."
      (2)   By delivery to the City of an assignment of a savings account or
certificate deposit to the "City of Springboro, Ohio" with the City having the
unrestricted right of withdrawal upon a written application by the City
Manager, without any requirement to show cause.
      (3)   By delivery to the City of a bank letter of credit in favor of the
"City of Springboro, Ohio" with the following provisions expressly stated
therein:
   (c)   This letter of credit shall remain in full force and effect, reduced
in amount only by payments made to the City of Springboro, until released by
the official action of the City Council of Springboro. The City of Springboro
may draw upon this letter of credit at any time, in any frequency, and in any
aggregate amount up to the amount stated hereon, by written application of the
City Manager, without any showing of cause.
   (d)   The text of the subdivider's agreement for both maintenance and
performance guarantees, as well as signature blocks, shall be maintained by the
City Engineer.
   (e)   The subdivider's agreement shall provide that the covenants contained
in the agreement shall run with the land and bind all successors, heirs, and
assignees of the subdivider. The subdivision improvement agreement will be
adopted by the City Council.
   (f)   Governmental units to which the subdivider's agreement and security
provisions apply may file, in lieu of the contract and security, a certified
resolution or ordinance from officers or agencies authorized to act in their
behalf, agreeing to comply with the provisions of this Article.
   (g)   In cases where a subdivider's agreement has been executed and security
has been posted and required public improvements have not been installed within
the terms of the subdivider's agreement, the City of Springboro may then:
      (1)   Suspend record plan approval, as provided in Section
1242.12 of these subdivision regulations, until the improvements are completed
and record a document to the effect for the purpose of public notice; or
      (2)   Obtain funds under the security and complete improvements itself or
through a third party; or
      (3)   Assign its right to receive funds under the security to any third
party, including a subsequent owner of the subdivision for which improvements
were not constructed, in whole or in part, in exchange for that subsequent
owner's promise to complete improvements in the subdivision.
   (h)   The approval of a subdivision plan by the Planning Commission, whether
concept, preliminary or final, shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the
acceptance by the City of any street, or park shown on the plan. Acceptance of
dedications is implemented through City Council ordinance.  (Ord. 0-15-4. 
Passed 2-19-15.)
1244.02  INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   The Planning Director shall provide for inspection of required improvements
during construction and ensure their satisfactory completion. The applicant
shall pay to the City an inspection fee as indicated in Section
1464.04, Permit fees, and where the improvements are completed prior to record
plan approval. These fees shall be due and payable upon demand of the City and
no building permits or certificates of occupancy shall be issued until all fees
are paid. If it is determined that any one or more of the required improvements
have not been constructed in accordance with the City's construction standards
and specifications as well as the construction plans, the applicant shall be
responsible for properly completing the improvements.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1244.03  RELEASE OF SECURITY.
   The City of Springboro will not accept dedication of required improvements,
nor release, nor reduce the amount of any security posted by the subdivider
until the City Engineer has submitted a certificate stating that all required
improvements have been satisfactorily completed and until the following
stipulations are met:
   (a)   The applicant's engineer or surveyor has certified to the City
Engineer, through submission of a detailed "as-built" survey plat of the
subdivision, indicating location, dimensions, materials, and other information
that the layout and grade of all public improvements is in accordance with the
approved construction drawings.
   (b)   If the security posted by the subdivider was a cash escrow, the amount
of that escrow shall be reduced upon actual acceptance of the dedication of
public improvements and then only to the ratio that the cost of the public
improvement for which dedication was accepted bears to the total cost of public
improvements for the subdivision. In no event shall a cash escrow be reduced
below 10 percent of the principal amount. Funds held in the escrow account
shall not be released to the subdivider, in whole or in part, except upon
resolution of the City Council. At the end of the maintenance and warranty
periods, all escrowed funds, if any, shall be released to the subdivider by the
Planning Director. In no event shall waivers be executed that would reduce the
security below 10 percent of its original amount.
      (Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1244.04  ESCROW DEPOSITS FOR LOT IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Whenever, by reason of the season of the year, any lot improvements
required by the subdivision regulations cannot be performed, the Building
Inspector may issue a certificate of occupancy, provided there is no danger to
health, safety, or general welfare upon accepting a cash escrow deposit in an
amount to be determined by the Director of Planning for the cost of the lot
improvements. The subdivision improvement agreement and security covering the
lot improvements shall remain in full force and effect.
   (b)   All required improvements for which escrow monies have been accepted
by the Planning Director at the time of issuance of a certificate of occupancy
shall be installed by the subdivider within a period of 9 months from the date
of deposit and issuance of the certificate of occupancy. If the improvements
have not been properly installed at the end of the time period, the Director of
Planning shall give 2 weeks written notice to the developer requiring it to
install the improvements, and if they are not then installed properly, the
Building and Zoning Inspector may request the City to proceed to contract out
the work for the installation of the necessary improvements in a sum not to
exceed the amount of the escrow deposit. At the time of the issuance of the
certificate of occupancy for which escrow monies are being deposited with the
Director of Planning, the developer shall obtain and file with the Building and
Zoning Inspector prior to obtaining the certificate of occupancy and a
notarized statement from the purchaser or the purchasers of the premises
authorizing the Director of Planning to install the improvements at the end of
the nine (9) month period if the improvements have not been duly installed by
the subdivider.  (Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1244.05  MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   The developer shall be required to maintain all required public improvements
on the individual subdivided lots and provide for snow and silt removal on
streets and sidewalks until acceptance of the improvements by the City. If
there are any certificates of occupancy on a street not dedicated to the City,
the City may on 12 hours notice plow the street, remove silt or effect
emergency repairs and charge those costs to the developer. Following the
acceptance of the dedication of any public improvement by the City (by
resolution of City Council), the subdivider shall provide security to guarantee
the maintenance of public improvements for a period of 1 year from the date of
release of the performance bond.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1244.06  DEFERRAL OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   The Planning Commission may defer or waive at the time of record plan
approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all public
improvements as, in its judgment, are not requisite in the interests of the
public health, safety, and general welfare, or which are inappropriate because
of the inadequacy or inexistence of connecting facilities. Any determination to
defer or waive the provision of any public improvement must be made on the
record and the reasons for the deferral or waiver also shall be expressly made
on the record.
   (b)   Whenever it is deemed necessary by the City to defer the construction
of any improvement required under these regulations because of incompatible
grades, future planning, inadequate or nonexistent connecting facilities, or
for other reasons, the subdivider shall pay his share of the costs of the
future improvements to the local government prior to signing of the record
plans by the City, or the developer may execute a separate subdivision
improvement agreement secured by a bond or cash escrow guaranteeing completion
of the deferred improvements upon demand of the local government.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1244.07  ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS AND CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY.
   (a)   The extent of street improvement shall be adequate for vehicular
access by the prospective occupant(s) and by police and fire equipment prior to
the issuance of an occupancy permit. The developer shall, at the time of the
offer of dedication, submit monies in escrow to the City in a sum determined by
the Director of Planning for the necessary final improvement of the street.
   (b)   No building permit shall be issued for the final 10 percent of lots in
section of a subdivision, or if 10 percent is less than two (2), for the final
two (2) buildable lots of a subdivision, until all public improvements required
by the Planning Commission for the subdivision have been fully completed and
the local government has accepted the developer's offer(s) to dedicate the
improvements.

1246.01  GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Conformance to Applicable Rules and Regulations. In addition to the
requirements established in these regulations, all subdivisions shall comply
with the following laws, rules, and regulations:
      (1)   All applicable state and federal statutory provisions.
      (2)   Adopted plans and policies, and all other applicable laws of the
City of Springboro or other appropriate jurisdictions.
      (3)   The special requirements of these regulations and any rules of the
Health Department and/or appropriate state or substate agencies.
      (4)   The Standard Construction Drawings and Specifications established
by the City Engineer.
      (5)   Record plan approval may be withheld if a subdivision is not in
conformity with the above laws, regulations, guidelines, and policies as well
as the purposes of these regulations.
   (b)   Subdivisions Straddling Municipal Boundaries.  Whenever access to the
subdivision is requested across land in another local government, the Planning
Commission shall request assurance from the Law Director that access is legally
established, and from the City Engineer that the access street is adequately
improved, or that a guarantee has been duly executed and is sufficient in
amount to assure the construction of the access street. In general, lot lines
should be laid out so as not to cross municipal boundary lines.
   (c)   Monuments. The applicant shall place permanent reference monuments in
the subdivision certified by a professional surveyor. Concrete monuments shall
be located along external subdivision boundaries and as determined by the City
Engineer. Iron pins shall be located at all lot corners, points of tangency,
curvature, at points as determined by the City Engineer. All monumentation
shall be in accordance with the minimum standards outlined in Ohio R.C.
4733.37.03.
   (d)   Land Suitability. Land that the Planning Commission finds to be
unsuitable for subdivision or development due to flooding, improper drainage,
steep slopes, rock formation, adverse earth formations or topography, utility
easements, or other features that will reasonably be harmful to the safety,
health, and general welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the
subdivision and/or its surrounding areas, shall not be subdivided or developed
unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer and approved by the
Planning Commission, upon recommendation of the City Engineer, to solve the
problems created by the unsuitable land conditions. Such land shall be set
aside for uses as shall not involve any danger to public health, safety, and
welfare.
   (e)   Street and Subdivision Names.  The proposed name of the subdivision or
proposed streets shall not duplicate, or too closely approximate phonetically,
the name of any other subdivision or thoroughfare in the fire district serving
the City. The City Engineer in consultation with the Police Department shall
have final authority to approve the names of the subdivisions and streets. In
general, a street which is (or is planned as) a continuation, through an
intersection, of an existing street shall bear the same name.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1246.02  STREET AND HIGHWAY CRITERIA.
   (a)   General Requirements.
      (1)   Frontage on Improved Streets.  No subdivision shall be approved
unless the area to be subdivided shall have frontage on and access from an
existing public street or a street shown upon a record plan approved by the
City Council and recorded in the County Recorder's office. Such street or
highway must be suitably improved as required by the City of Springboro
regulations, specifications, or orders, or be secured by a performance bond
required under these subdivision regulations, with the width and right-of-way
required by these subdivision regulations and the Mobility Master Plan.
      (2)   Access To and Between Subdivisions. All major subdivisions shall
have 2 or more connections to existing streets, located in such a manner as to
allow maximum opportunity for quick access to all parts of the subdivision by
emergency vehicles. Major subdivisions with between 4and 20 lots may request an
exception from the Planning Commission from this requirement in cases where
such connections are not feasible. In allowing such exceptions, the Planning
Commission may require larger than minimum right-of-way and pavement widths for
the entrance street or other provisions that optimize the accessibility of
emergency vehicles in a variety of emergency situations. Minor subdivisions
shall have no more than 1 connection to existing streets.
   (b)   Traffic Impact Study to Determine Levels of Service.  The applicant
for any development projected to generate more than 1,000 vehicle trips per day
or 100 vehicle trips during the peak a.m. or p.m. peak hour, as outlined in the
Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual shall submit
a traffic impact analysis for review by the City for the purposes of
determining the impact on the adjoining thoroughfare system, and to identify
thoroughfare improvement projects necessary to support the traffic impact in
balance with roadway safety. At the discretion of the City Engineer, a traffic
impact study may be required for uses generating less than 1,000 vehicle trips
per day. The City of Springboro Traffic Access and Impact Study Guidelines, or
successor guidelines, shall be used as the basis for any study required by
these regulations.
   (c)   Improvement Plan.  Streets shall be graded and improved, shall conform
to the City of Springboro Standard Construction Drawings and Specifications,
and shall be approved as to design and specifications by the City Engineer.
   (d)   Classification and Function.  All streets and highways shall be
classified as outlined in the Springboro Mobility Master Plan as an Interstate/
Expressway, Arterial, Collector, or Local thoroughfare.  Streets and their
designs should reflect their location within the community, be coordinated with
adjacent land uses and provide for the numerous functions a street serves such
as vehicular, pedestrian and bicycle circulation, social interaction as well as
public space.  Designs may be accomplished through street section designs that
include sidewalks, street trees, on-street parking and pavement widths as
outlined in the Springboro Mobility Master Plan.
   (e)   Street Section and Construction Design.  Table 2 below identifies
typical sections for streets constructed within the City of Springboro:

      (1)   All improvements shall be installed by the developer and shall
conform to all City of Springboro Standard Construction Drawings and
Specifications.
      (2)   Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards designated in these
regulations may be required whenever additional width is necessary to provide
adequate earth slopes due to topography. Such slopes shall not be in excess of
3-to-1.
      (3)   Limited access expressways, where so located as to affect the
subdivision of adjoining lands shall, be treated as follows:  In residential
districts, a landscaped buffer strip at least 30 feet in depth in addition to
the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be provided adjacent
to limited access highways. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and
shall be designated on the record plan with the following text: "This strip is
reserved for screening. The placement of structure on this land is prohibited."
      (4)   Centerline grades shall not be less than  0.5percent on any street.
Centerline grades shall not exceed 6 percent on interstates/ expressways,
arterial and collector streets, and 10 percent on local streets.
      (5)   Vertical curves shall be used at all grade changes. Minimum sight
distances shall be 300 feet for major residential streets, 200 feet for
secondary residential streets, and 100 feet for minor residential streets. A
tangent of 50 feet minimum shall be required between reverse curves. Whenever
roadway lines are deflected, connection shall be made in the form of a
horizontal curve.
      (6)   Intersections.
         A.   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect at right angles. A
proposed intersection of 2 new streets at an angle of less than 60 degrees
shall be prohibited. An oblique street should be curved approaching an
intersection, and should be at right angles for at least 100 feet there from.
Not more than 2 streets shall intersect at any one point unless specifically
approved by the Planning Commission.
         B.   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street
shall, wherever practicable, coincide with existing intersections on the
opposite side of such street. Street off-sets with center-line offsets of less
than 150 feet shall not be permitted Intersections of an arterial street with
another street shall be at least 800 feet apart. For the purposes of
intersection design, private drives generating more than 1,000 vehicle trips
per day as outlined in the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip
Generation Manual shall be considered in the same manner as a public street.
         C.   Minimum curb radius at the intersection of 2 local streets shall
be at least 20 feet; and minimum curb radius at an intersection involving an
arterial or collector street shall be at least 35 feet.
         D.   At the approach to an intersection, a leveling area shall be
provided having not greater than a 2 percent slope.  The leveling area shall
extend to a distance of 35 feet from the edge of the pavement of the through
street.
         E.   Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or
existing or proposed vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a
traffic hazard by limiting visibility, the developer shall redesign the roadway
to avoid the removal of trees and other vegetation, and the developer shall cut
such ground and/or vegetation (including trees) in connection with the grading
of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary to provide an
adequate intersection sight distance as determined by the City Engineer.
Intersection site distances shall be designed to meet minimum Ohio Department
of Transportation (ODOT) design criteria.
      (7)   Topography and Arrangement.
         A.   Streets shall be related to the topography and generally accepted
engineering principles. All streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many
building sites as possible at, or above, the grades of the streets. Grades of
streets shall conform as closely as possible to the original topography. A
combination of steep grades and curves shall be avoided in the same area.
         B.   All streets shall be integrated with the existing and proposed
street network and or dedicated rights-of-way as established in the Mobility
Master Plan.
         C.   Minor or local street layout shall conform as much as possible to
the existing topography, to discourage through traffic, and to permit efficient
drainage and utility systems.
         D.   The street network shall be an interconnected system that
connects to existing and other proposed streets.
         E.   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions, or unless in the opinion of the Planning Commission such extension
is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the
subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous future
development of adjacent tracks.
         F.   In business, office and manufacturing areas, the streets and
other access ways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of
buildings, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas,
and walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of movement between the
various types of traffic, including pedestrians.

         A.   Blocks shall have sufficient length and width to provide for 2
tiers of lots of adequate size and dimension to comply with the density
requirements of the Planning and Zoning Code, except where double frontage lots
are approved by the Planning Commission. The design of lots shall conform to
Section
1246.06, Lot Layout, of these regulations.
         B.   The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be of such
dimension as to facilitate compliance with the density requirements of the
applicable zoning regulations, but block lengths in residential areas shall not
exceed 1,000 feet, nor be less than 200 feet in length.
         C.   Pedestrian way access easements, not less than 10 feet wide, may
be required by the Planning Commission through the midpoint of blocks more than
700 feet  long where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to
schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, or other community
facilities. Blocks designed for industrial uses shall be of such length and
width as may be determined suitable by the Planning Commission for prospective
use. Sidewalks constructed in such pedestrian access easements shall conform to
Section
1246.07, Sidewalks and Curbs, of these regulations.
   (f)   Access to Arterial Streets.  Where a subdivision borders on or
contains an existing or proposed arterial, the Planning Commission may require
that access to such streets be limited by one of the following means:
      (1)   The subdivision of lots shall include access to lots from a
parallel local street or rear alley, no direct access shall be provided from
the arterial street.
      (2)   U-shaped streets with the rear lines of their lots backing onto the
primary arterial.
      (3)   Marginal access or service streets (separated from the arterial by
a planting or grass strip and having access at suitable points).
   (g)   Street Signs.  The applicant shall install all street signs. Special
street signs other than city required signs shall be installed by the developer
and maintained by the homeowners association. Street name signs are to be
placed at all intersections within or abutting the subdivision, the type and
location of which to be approved by the City Engineer.
   (h)   Post Lights. Post lights shall be located in the front yard and be
mounted 5 feet above the ground, and supplied by an underground circuit at a
minimum of 15 amps, 120 volts.  Such lights shall not be less than 75 watts,

shall be indicated on a landscape plan to be reviewed and approved by the
Planning Commission and shall outline the tree species, caliper, and location.
   (k)   Construction of Streets and Dead-End Streets.
      (1)   The arrangement of streets shall provide for continuation of
streets between adjacent properties when the continuation is necessary for
convenient movement of traffic, effective fire protection, for efficient
provision of utilities, and/or where the continuation is in accordance with the
City of Springboro Mobility Master Plan. If the adjacent property is
undeveloped and the street must temporarily be a dead-end street, the right-of-
way shall be extended to the property line. The city may require that temporary
T-or L-shaped turnabouts be provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with
the notation on the record plan that land outside the normal street right-of-
way shall revert to adjacent property owners whenever the street is continued.
The Planning Commission may limit the length of temporary dead-end streets in
accordance with the design standards of these regulations.
      (2)   Where a street does not extend beyond the boundary of the
subdivision and its continuation is not required by the Planning Commission for
access to adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be nearer to such
boundary than 50 feet. However, the Planning Commission may require the
reservation of an easement to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian
traffic, or utilities.

50 feet which shall have a back curb radius of not less than 39.5 feet. The
cul-de-sac may have an island if there is a minimum of 20 feet of pavement
surface encircling the island.
   (l)   Street Dedications and Reservations.  Where a subdivision borders an
existing narrow or substandard street or when the Comprehensive Land Use Master
Plan or Mobility Master Plan indicate plans for realignment or widening of a
street that would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the
applicant shall be required to improve and dedicate at its expense those areas
for widening or realignment of those streets. Frontage streets and streets
shall be improved and dedicated by the developer at their own expense to the
full width as required by these subdivision regulations.

1246.03  STORM WATER MANAGEMENT AND EROSION CONTROL.
   (a)   General Requirements.  All subdivisions shall provide detention/
retention systems and make provision for storm and flood water runoff channels
or basins in accordance with the City of Springboro Standard Construction
Drawings and Specifications. The storm water drainage system shall be separate
and independent of any sanitary sewer system. These design criteria are not
intended to cover extraordinary situations. Deviations will be allowed and may
be required in instances when considered justified by the City Engineer. Inlets
shall be provided so that surface water is not carried across or around any
intersection, or for a distance of more than 350 feet in the gutter. When
calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further
allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point, and basins shall be used to
intercept flow at that point. Surface water drainage patterns shall be shown
for each and every lot and block.
   (b)   Location.  The applicant, shall at the discretion of the City
Engineer, be required to carry away by pipe any spring or surface water that
may exist either previously to, or as a result of the subdivision. No open
ditches shall be permitted unless specifically approved by the City Engineer.
Pipes shall not be required to be installed when the diameter is in excess of
60 inches. Exceptions to the piping requirement may be made for aesthetic water
features as approved by the Planning Commission and City Engineer. Such
drainage facilities shall be located in perpetual unobstructed easements of a
width that meet generally accepted engineering principles.
   (c)   Accommodation of Upstream Drainage Areas. Storm sewers shall be
designed to accommodate a 10-year storm, post development tributary area, storm
not including any detention.
   (d)   Effects on Downstream Drainage Areas. The developer shall also study
the effect of each subdivision on existing downstream drainage facilities
outside the area of the subdivision when requested of the City Engineer. Local
government drainage studies together with such other studies as shall be
appropriate and shall serve as a guide to needed improvements. Where it is
anticipated that the additional runoff incidental to the development of the
subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage facility, the
Planning Commission may withhold approval of the subdivision until provisions
have been made for the expansion of the existing downstream drainage facility.
No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be provided to
an adequate drainage watercourse or facility.
   (e)   Areas of Poor Drainage. Whenever a record plan is submitted for an
area that is subject to flooding, the Planning Commission may approve such
subdivision provided that the applicant fills the affected area of the
subdivision to an elevation sufficient to place the elevation of streets and
lots at a minimum of 12 inches above the elevation of the 100 year floodplain,
as determined by FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) information. In areas not
covered by FIRM information, the City Engineer shall require the developer to
establish a 100 year flood boundary. The record plan of the subdivision shall
provide for a floodway along the bank of any stream or watercourse, in a width
that shall be sufficient in times of high water to contain or move the water,
and no fill shall be placed in the overflow zone nor shall any structure be
erected or placed in the overflow zone. The boundaries of the overflow zone
shall be subject to approval by the City Engineer. The Planning Commission may
deny subdivision approval for areas of extremely poor drainage.
   (f)   Dedication and Drainage Easements.
      (1)   General Requirements. When a subdivision is traversed by a
watercourse, drainage way, channel, or stream, a storm water easement or
drainage right-of-way shall be provided by the developer conforming
substantially to the lies of such watercourse. The city is not responsible for
the maintenance of said watercourses.
      (2)   Drainage Easements. Where topography or other conditions are such
as to make impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within street
rights-of-way, perpetual, unobstructed easements at least 10 feet  in width for
drainage facilities, or as determined by the City Engineer, shall be provided
across property outside the right-of-way and with satisfactory access to the
right-of-way. Easements shall be indicated on the record plan. Drainage
easements shall extend from the right-of-way to a natural watercourse or to
other drainage facilities. Each lot shall contain a drainage easement along the
side and or rear of the lot as required by the City Engineer. The city shall
not maintain said drainage easements.
   (g)   Storm Water Management and Erosion Control.
      (1)   Approval of a subdivision shall be conditioned upon the developer's
presentation of a detailed surface water management plan that will prevent
erosion and not permit the discharge so that the runoff rate after development
cannot be greater than the 1-year pre-development storm rate.
      (2)   Before a subdivision or parcel is cleared, graded or otherwise
disturbed by the movement of earth by any person, partnership, or corporation,
a Storm Water Management and Erosion Control Plan describing the proposed earth
movement shall be provided to and approved by the City Engineer.
         A.   Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away
from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the
Water Management and Erosion Control Plan for the development.

time and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a practical minimum. The
topsoil shall be preserved and returned to the surface of areas to be re-
vegetated, or new topsoil shall be provided, or the surface will be covered
with sod, and structural erosion control shall be installed.
         D.   Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as practical, with
temporary vegetation or mulching to protect exposed critical areas during
development but no more than 30 days or as determined by the City Engineer in
accordance with generally accepted engineering practice as applied to the
specific facts of the development.
         E.   The permanent final vegetation shall be installed within 30 days
final grading, or as determined by the City Engineer.

Commission may waive the requirements set out in Section
1250.01 (a), Procedure for Resubdivision.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1250.02  RECORD PLAN VACATION.
   (a)   Owner Initiated Record Plan Vacation.  The owner or owners of lots in
any approved subdivision, including the developer, may petition City Council to
vacate the record plan with respect to their properties.
      (1)   Notice and Hearing.  In accordance with Ohio R.C. 713.12, the City
Council shall publish notice in a newspaper of general circulation of the
petition for vacation to all owners of property within the affected subdivision
and shall state the in the notice, the time and place of the Public Hearing on
the vacation petition. The Public Hearing shall take place no less than 30 days
after the published notice.
      (2)   Criteria.  The City Council shall approve the petition for vacation
on such terms and conditions as are reasonable to protect public health, safety
and welfare; but in no event may the City Council approve a petition for
vacation if it will materially injure the rights of any non-consenting property
owner or any public rights in public improvements unless expressly agreed to by
the governing body.
      (3)   Recordation of Revised Record Plan. Upon approval of any petition
for vacation, the City Council shall direct the petitioners to prepare a
Revised Record Plan in accordance with these regulations. The Record Plan may
be recorded only after having been signed by the Mayor, Clerk of Council, and
the City Engineer.
      (4)   Developer Initiated Vacation. When the developer of the
subdivision, or its successors, owns all of the lots in the subdivision, the
developer or successor may petition for vacation of the record plan and the
petition may be approved, conditionally approved, or disapproved by the City
Council. The developer or its successor will have no right to a refund of any
monies, fees or charges paid to the City.
   (b)   Government Initiated Record Plan Vacation.
      (1)   General Conditions.  The City Council, on its motion, may vacate
the record plan of an approved subdivision when:
         A.   No lots within the approved subdivision have been sold within 5
years from the date that the record plan was signed by the Mayor, Clerk of
Council, and the City Engineer.
         B.   The developer has breached a subdivision improvement agreement
and the City of Springboro is unable to obtain funds with which to complete
construction of public improvements. The vacation shall apply only to lots
owned by the developer or its successor.
         C.   The record plan has been of record for more than 5 years and the
City Council, upon the recommendation of the Planning Commission, determines
that the further sale of lots within the subdivision presents a threat to
public health, safety and welfare. The vacation shall apply only to lots owned
by the developer or its successor.
      (2)   Procedure. Upon any motion of the City Council to vacate the record
plan of any previously approved subdivision, in whole or in part, the City
Council shall publish notice in a newspaper of general circulation. The notice
shall state the time and place for a Public Hearing on the motion to vacate the
subdivision plat.
      (3)   Recordation of the Record Plan. If the City Council adopts a
resolution vacating a record plan in whole, it shall record a copy of the
resolution in the Recorder's office of Montgomery or Warren County. If the City
Council adopts a resolution vacating a record plan in part, it shall record a
copy of the resolution as described above and cause a Revised Record Plan to be
recorded which shows that portion of the original record plan that has been
vacated and that portion that has not been vacated.

   (a)   Where Boundaries Approximately Follow Streets, Alleys or Highways.
Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the
centerlines of streets, alleys or highways, street lines, alley lines, or
highway right-of-way lines, such centerlines, street lines, alley lines or
highway right-of-way lines shall be construed to be such district boundaries.
   (b)   Where Boundaries Approximately Follow Lot Lines. Where district
boundaries are indicated as approximately follow lot lines, such lot lines
shall be construed to be such district boundaries.
   (c)   Where Boundaries Parallel Street Right-of-Way Lines, Alley Lines, or
Highway Right-of Way Lines. Where district boundaries are indicated as
approximately parallel to the centerlines or street lines of streets, the
centerlines or alley lines of alleys, or the centerlines or right-of-way lines
of highways, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel
thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the Zoning Map. If no
distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by use of the scale shown
on the Zoning Map.

such stream, lake or other body of water shall be construed as being the limit
of the district, unless otherwise indicated.
   (e)   Vacation of Public Ways.  Whenever any street, alley or public way is
vacated in the manner authorized by law, the zoning districts adjoining each
side of the street, alley or public way shall be automatically extended to the
center of such vacations and all areas included in the vacation shall then and
henceforth be subject to all regulations of the extended districts.
   (f)   Boundary Determination.  Where the district boundaries cannot
reasonably be determined by application of the above methods, City Council

parks that combine and integrate light industrial and/or manufacturing uses
with offices and similar land uses.
      (2)   Intent.  The intent of the ED District is to enhance the city's
economic base by providing suitable areas to support the employment needs of
the community in developments that are compatible with adjacent uses. The
employment center district provides for the location of light manufacturing and
product processing, research and development facilities, professional services,
medical facilities and complementary educational and recreational uses which
are not detrimental to the employment district. Limited retail, business and
support services that serve the needs of the employment district tenants and

nuisance factors and hazards.
   (g)   LBD Local Business District.
      (1)   Purpose.  The purpose of the LBD Local Business District is to
accommodate business uses that are smaller in scale and serve the local
community.
      (2)   Intent.  The intent of the LBD Local Business District is to meet
the day-to-day convenience shopping and service needs of persons residing in
adjacent residential areas and to permit such uses as are necessary to satisfy
those limited basic shopping and/or service needs that, by their nature and
size, are not related to the community-wide or regional shopping pattern.
   (h)   HBD Highway Business District.
      (1)   Purpose.  The purpose of the HBD Highway Business District is to
accommodate business uses that by their nature are dependent on a high traffic,
high visibility location and/or which generate substantial amounts of traffic
either continuously or at peak periods.

automobile highway traffic, and to provide for uses that draw from a regional
market and whose customers or clients rely to a great extent upon the freeway
system. The HBD Highway Business District is intended to be located at the
interchange areas of feeder roads and freeway facilities.  These uses are often
large in scale, or occupy a portion of a multiple occupancy complex which
includes large-scale "anchor" uses.
   (i)   CBD Central Business District.
      (1)   Purpose.  The purpose of the CBD Central Business District is to
accommodate the preservation and redevelopment in the historical core of the
City with a mix of residential, retail, office and community, civic, and
institutional uses. Residential uses are also appropriate when provided in a
mixed-use/live-work environment.
      (2)   Intent.  The intent of the CBD Central Business District is to
create a unique, historic, walkable mixed use district with a diversity of
office, retail, institutional and residential spaces in the historic core of
the community. Encourage shared parking areas dispersed throughout the district
typically located behind the buildings that front on South Main Street and
adjoining streets and to prohibit industrial and automotive related services
and nonretail uses.
   (j)   TCD Town Center District.
      (1)   Purpose.  The purpose of the TCD Town Center District is to reserve
land for commercial uses located at the intersection of SR 73 and SR 741.

      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of the M-1 District is to provide land for
manufacturing establishments which are clean, quiet and free of hazardous or
objectionable elements such as noise, odor, dust, smoke or glare, which operate
within enclosed structures and which generate little industrial traffic.
      (2)   Intent.  The intent of the M-1 District is to accommodate wholesale
activities, warehouses, light industrial operations and limited service
commercial uses that are complementary and are not detrimental to either
existing or proposed industrial uses. Residential uses, uses incidental to
residential development and most retail activities are prohibited from this
district.
   (l)   M-2 Heavy Manufacturing District.
      (1)   Purpose.   The purpose of the M-2 District is to provide land for
major manufacturing, processing, storage, warehousing, research and testing
establishments which require large sites, extensive community services and
facilities, ready access to regional transportation, generate heavy traffic and
create no nuisance discernible beyond the District.
      (2)   Intent. The intent of the M-2 District is to provide areas for
heavy manufacturing uses involving activities that do not complement the
character of commercial or residential areas.  M-2 zoned areas should be
located so as to ensure that heavy manufacturing uses will not result in
detrimental impacts to commercial or residential districts. Typical uses in
this district include processing of natural and manmade materials for use in
general manufacturing.

1262.01  STANDARD METHODS OF MEASUREMENT.
   The following standard methods of measurement are used in applying the
dimensional requirements established in this Ordinance.
   (a)   Minimum Yard Setback Requirements.  The minimum yard setback
requirements listed in Table 4 shall be measured from the property line or the
edge of the planned right-of-way in the Mobility Master Plan (Chapter
1226), existing right-of-way if a planned right-of-way does not exist, or road
or highway easement when the property line extends to the centerline of the
road, unless specifically noted otherwise.
   (b)   Measurement of Building Setbacks.  When a building contains an
overhang, eave or similar projection, the minimum yard setback for such
building shall be measured from the edge or outer most portion of said
overhang, eave or similar projection.
   (c)   Yard and Open Space Calculations. No space which has already been
calculated as part of any required yard (front, side or rear) or open space for
a building, lot or development shall be used again to satisfy the same
requirements for any other building, lot or development.

CHAPTER 1263
Permitted Uses by District
1263.01   Permitted uses.
1263.02   Prohibited uses and uses not expressly permitted.
1263.03   Multiple uses.
1263.04   Table of permitted uses.
 
1263.01  PERMITTED USES.
   In order to avoid intrusion of undesirable uses and to foster all possible
benefits for a continued high quality environment, all residential and
nonresidential land and structure uses have been classified into permitted
uses.  Permitted uses include those which require a minimum of limitation and
are therefore permitted anywhere within a zoning district.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1263.02  PROHIBITED USES AND USES NOT EXPRESSLY PERMITTED.
   (a)   Prohibited Uses Generally.  No building shall be erected, converted,
enlarged, reconstructed or structurally altered, nor shall any building or land
with public and/or privately developed improvements be used, arranged to be
used or designed to be used, in a manner which does not comply with all of the
district provisions established by these regulations for the districts in which
the building or land is located.
      (1)   Uses which do not appear in the Ordinance by virtue of their
omission from Section
1263.04, Table 6. Permitted Uses by District are prohibited.
      (2)   A prohibited use may become a permitted use if Council passes an
amendment incorporating the prohibited use into appropriate use lists for
appropriate zoning district(s).
      (3)   A prohibited use may become a permitted use if the Zoning Inspector
determines the use should be a permitted use in an appropriate zoning district
because it is substantially similar in character to specifically permitted use
in such district.
      (4)   Uses for enterprises or purposes that are contrary to federal,
state, or local laws or ordinances are prohibited.
   (b)   Prohibited Uses.  The following uses are prohibited in all zoning
districts:
      (1)   Medical marijuana as defined in the Ohio Revised Code Chapter 3796.
         A.   The cultivation, processing and dispensing of medical marijuana
are prohibited uses in all zoning districts.
         B.   This prohibition shall not be applicable to the extent it limits
any research related to marijuana conducted at a state university, academic
medical center, or private research and development organization as part of a
research protocol approved by an institutional review board or equivalent
entity.
         C.   Nothing herein shall prohibit the legal personal use or legal
possession of medical marijuana by individuals in the City.
      (2)   Certain home occupations identified in Section
1264.33(j), Development Standards for Specific Uses, Home Occupations.
      (3)   Certain uses as identified in Section
1268.01(e), ADD-1, Austin Development District 1, Prohibited Uses.
         (Ord. O-17-38.  Passed 9-7-17.)
1263.03  MULTIPLE USES.
   A use may be combined with any other use(s) permitted in the zoning district
provided that the regulations for each use are maintained. Excluding home
occupations, residential uses occupying the same structure as a non-residential
use(e.g., dwellings per Section
1264.03 and Section
1264.05) shall be physically separated and shall have separate entrances.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1263.04  TABLE OF PERMITTED USES.
   The following Table 6 lists the uses that may be permitted in each zoning
district, provided that the development also meets the design and building
standards set forth for each district, along with all other development
standards contained in this Ordinance.  For instance, when a certain use is or
may be permitted in more than one zoning district, each zoning district will
have different standards for building bulk, location, and design.  The
customized design standards set forth in each zoning district are tailored to
the existing and intended character of each zoning district, and are further
intended to prevent contextually inappropriate development from occurring
within the City.
   (a)   Uses Permitted in Each District.  Table 6 lists the permitted uses in
each district.  Refer to Chapter
1290 for definitions of all uses listed in the following Table 6.
   (b)   Development Standards Applicable to Uses.  Whenever a specific
development standard is included for a particular use in Table 6, any
development must comply with the requirements of the referenced section.  All
development standards are listed in Chapter
1264.
   (c)   Special Purpose Zoning Districts Not Listed in Table 4.  Refer to
Chapter
1266 through Chapter
1270 for the uses and development standards applicable in the special purpose
zoning districts.  Use and development standards for some special purpose
zoning districts are not listed in Table 6, and include the PUD, Planned Unit
Development District, ADD-2 Austin Development District 2, and Mobile Home
Parks.

PWS Facility, and prior to the issuance of a building permit for the
construction of a tower, the Applicant shall enter into a written agreement
with the City committing to make the approved tower available to additional
users. The willful and knowing misrepresentation and the subsequent failure of
the Applicant to construct the tower and act in accordance with the approval,
the signed co-location agreement and the City's co-location policy is unlawful
and shall, among other remedies of the City, including the revocation of the
Zoning Certificate, and shall be cause for the withholding of future permits
for similar facilities and PWS Facilities within the City. The Applicant shall
agree to make its tower available to other PWS providers on reasonable terms
and conditions.
      (3)   A PWS provider who is denied access to a PWS Facility tower
previously approved under this section, may petition the Zoning Inspector to
review its request to use the existing PWS Facility tower. The Zoning Inspector
may hold a hearing, at which all parties shall appear, to determine whether the
requested co-location is technically, legally and economically feasible and to
determine if the permittee is in breach of its agreement with the City to
permit such co-location. Upon finding that co-location on an existing PWS
Facility tower is technically, legally and economically feasible and/or upon a
finding that the permittee is in breach of its co-location agreement, the
Zoning Inspector may act in accordance with the remedies set forth in Section
1264.40 above. All costs associated with the Zoning Inspector's review and
mediation of co-location disputes shall be shared equally by the petitioner and
the permittee.
   (c)   Prohibited Areas for New Towers. New PWS towers shall not be located
within a Residential District nor within plain view of the Historic
Preservation District.
   (d)   Application for Co-location or Establishment of PWS Facility. It is
preferred that all Applicants desiring to establish PWS Facilities within the
City utilize Existing Towers or Existing Support Structures. The Zoning
Inspector, in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth below,
shall have the authority to grant Zoning Certificates for the establishment of
PWS Facilities. Where the standards and/or requirements of this section
conflict with the other provisions of the Codified Ordinances, the specific

has clearly demonstrated by substantial evidence in the record that it has
complied with the standards set forth below. In each case, the Zoning Inspector
shall make written findings of fact and conclusions, directly based on and
supported by the record presented to it in the Application.
         A.   Standards for approval for a co-location. For a PWS Facility for
co-location or for a PWS Facility on an Existing Tower or on an Existing
Support Structure, the Zoning Inspector must find that the Application complies
with the following standards:
            1.   The Applicant has complied with the submission requirements of
Section
1264.40. above;
            2.   The PWS Facility is in compliance with all applicable
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance;
            3.   All Antennas mounted on or within an existing support
structure are adequately screened, painted and/or architecturally treated so as
to blend into the proposed or existing architectural character of the
structure. To the extent possible, equipment associated with PWS Facilities on
existing support structures shall be located within the support structure. If a
new equipment shelter is included as a part of a PWS Facility, it shall have an
appearance consistent with other buildings or structures on the parcel and will
preserve the character of the City as a rural neighborhood of homes, green open
spaces and farms;

increase the existing height of the tower by more than 10 percent, or by the
height of one additional antenna array with separation from the nearest
existing antenna not to exceed 20 feet, whichever is greater, except that the
mounting of the proposed antenna may exceed the size limits set forth in this
paragraph if necessary to avoid interference with existing antennas; or
               b.   The mounting of the proposed antenna would involve adding
an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the edge of
the tower more than 20 feet, or more than the width of the tower structure at
the level of the appurtenance, whichever is greater, except that the mounting
of the proposed antenna may exceed the size limits set forth in this paragraph
if necessary to shelter the antenna from inclement weather or to connect the
antenna to the tower via cable; or
               c.   The mounting of the proposed antenna would involve adding
an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the edge of
the tower more than 20 feet, or more than the width of the tower structure at
the level of the appurtenance, whichever is greater, except that the mounting
of the proposed antenna may exceed the size limits set forth in this paragraph
if necessary to shelter the antenna from inclement weather or to connect the
antenna to the tower via cable; or
               d.   The mounting of the proposed antenna would involve
excavation outside the current tower site, defined as the current boundaries of
the leased or owned property surrounding the tower and any access or utility
easements currently related to the site.
         B.   Standards for approval for a new tower. A proposed PWS Facility
which will require the construction of a new tower shall comply with the
standards set forth in Section
1264.40. above and the following additional standards:
            1.   The area proposed to be serviced by the PWS Facility cannot be
adequately addressed by the establishment of a PWS Facility on an existing
tower or an existing support structure;
            2.   The use of an existing tower located either within or outside
the City limits, is not technically, structurally, economically and/or
financially feasible. The City may deny the Application for a PWS Zoning
Certificate if the Applicant has not made a good faith effort to locate the
antenna on an existing tower or structure;
            3.   The proposed facility has adequate capacity to handle the
applicant and at least two additional users;
            4.   No federal, state, or city government land is available for
the siting of the proposed PWS Facility.
            5.   All towers shall be galvanized and/or painted with a rust-
preventative paint of an appropriate color such as white, off white, light
blue, blue gray, or light gray, in harmony with the natural or built
environment of the site and surrounding area, unless required by the FAA to
bear a different finish;
            6.   All obstruction lighting and/or marking required by the FAA

site compound. This landscaped area shall consist of a minimum 10-foot wide
landscaped strip around the entire site compound for new tower sites or
landscaping consistent with the use principal use of the site for PWS
Facilities utilizing existing support structures. At the discretion of the
Zoning Inspector, this landscape requirement may be waived for PWS Facilities
on existing support structures. The Applicant shall propose a mix of evergreen
tree, evergreen shrubs and ground cover to provide adequate screening of all
structures and equipment within the site compound, excluding any tower
structure but including any fence or wall surrounding the site compound. The
landscaping requirement may be varied, at the discretion of the Zoning
Inspector as site specific conditions dictate.
      (3)   Maintenance, abandonment and removal.
         A.   The owner/operator of an approved PWS Facility shall be
responsible for the maintenance of the site compound, associated landscaping,
access driveway and any associated areas of the property used as a part of the
PWS Facility. All tower finishes shall be maintained free of peeling, rusting,
or other unsightly coloration or condition.
         B.   All providers utilizing towers shall present a report to the City
notifying it of any tower facility located within the City whose use will be
discontinued and the date this use will cease. Such report shall be filed with
the City at least 30 days prior to the cessation date. If at any time the use
of the facility is discontinued for 180 days, the Zoning Inspector may declare
the facility abandoned. The owner/operator of the facility will receive written
notice from the Zoning Inspector and be instructed to either reactivate use of
the facility within 180 days, or dismantle and remove the facility. If the
reactivation or dismantling does not occur, the City will either remove the
facility or will contract to have the facility removed and assess the owner/
operator the costs. The City must provide the tower owner 30 days notice and an
opportunity to be heard at a Public Hearing before the Board of Zoning Appeals
before initiating such action. Such Public Hearing shall follow the 30 day
notice. All interested parties shall be allowed an opportunity to be heard at
the Public Hearing. After such hearing has been held, the City shall have the
authority to initiate proceedings to either acquire the tower and any
appurtenances attached thereto, or in the alternative, order demolition of the
tower and all appurtenances. After a Public Hearing is held, the City may order
the abatement or demolition of the tower. The City may require the certificate
holder or owner of the facility to pay for all expenses necessary to acquire or
demolish the tower.
         C.   As a condition of the Zoning Inspector's approval of a PWS
Facility, the owner of the property upon which the PWS Facility is located
shall be required to submit to the Zoning Inspector the owner's covenant to
undertake the responsibility and cost for the removal of a PWS Facility, which
covenant shall be made enforceable by the City and recorded as a lien against
the property. This lien shall be released after removal and final inspection
and sign off by the Zoning Inspector or his designee. An Applicant must deposit
with the City and for the benefit of the City Council a letter of credit,
performance bond, or other security acceptable to the Zoning Inspector in an
amount equal to the amount necessary to demolish and remove the facility as
determined by the City Engineer. Any such guarantee shall be irrevocable and

by the Zoning Inspector as a part of the Zoning Certificate Application
process. The fence/wall shall be installed along the perimeter of the site
compound. The Zoning Inspector may in his sole discretion impose these fence/
wall requirements on PWS Facilities utilizing existing support structures.
      (5)   Setbacks, fall zones and lot size. Towers associated with a PWS
Facility shall be set back from all property lines a distance equal to the
height of the tower. To reduce the risk of personal injury or property damage,
towers shall be located at least 125 percent of their height from any building,
street, bikeway, or pedestrian walkway. All other structures or equipment
associated with a PWS Facility must comply with the appropriate setback
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance. Fee simple purchases for the lawful
erection of the PWS facility need not conform to the minimum lot size
requirements of the City Zoning Code, but shall not create a nonconformity for
the remaining portion of any lot from which the land for the PWS facility was
obtained.
      (6)   Tower height. No tower shall exceed 160 feet in height. However,
the Zoning Inspector may approve a Zoning Certificate for a new tower whose
proposed height exceeds 160 feet upon making written findings of fact and
conclusions that the additional height allowed will further the City's policy
to encourage co-location of PWS Facilities and will not negatively affect
safety and aesthetics.
      (7)   Modifications. Any modification to PWS Facility approved under this
section, shall require the submission of a new Zoning Certificate Application
in accordance with the provisions and requirements of subsection (d)(2)A
hereof. The Zoning Inspector may agree to waive certain submission requirements
if, at his discretion, the Zoning Inspector believes such a waiver is
justified.

plumbing and other permits may be required by the City or other agency for a
PWS Facility or site compound as local requirements may prescribe.
      (17)   Enforcement. Any violation of this section by a certificate holder
which continues for more than 30days shall constitute sufficient cause for an
order to be issued by the Zoning Inspector requiring removal of the PWS
facility and its associated foundation, equipment, enclosure, and access
paving. Any person who fails to either abide by such order or remedy the
violation within sixty 60 days after actual receipt thereof shall be punishable
in accord with the provisions of Chapter
1288 of the Codified Ordinances of Springboro. Any tower which remains in place
following the 60 period for remediation set forth above, without full
remediation of the violation having been made, is hereby declared to be a
public and private nuisance. Such tower may, at the City's option and after
notice and hearing, be removed by the City without liability therefore, and the
cost of such removal, including but not limited to demolition costs,
transportation costs, disposal costs and legal fees and expenses shall be
recovered from the certificate holder or for the property owner of record by
special assessment against the property, by civil action, by collection of the

1266.01  INTENT AND OBJECTIVES.
   (a)   It is the intent of this chapter to accommodate creative and
imaginative planned unit developments (hereinafter referred to as PUDs) and to
permit those innovations in land development that are in the best interest of
the City of Springboro, in situations where conventional zoning is
inappropriate or unduly restrictive. In order to accomplish this intent, it is
the purpose of a PUD District to permit, in a carefully-designed development, a
variety of uses and/or dwelling types, and to permit the flexible spacing of
lots and buildings, the conservation of natural features of the landscape, the
provision of accessible and enjoyable open spaces, and the provision of a
necessary complement of community and neighborhood facilities.
   (b)   The Planning Commission shall hear and determine all variances and
appeals from orders, requirements, decisions or determinations, made by the
administrative department or administrative employees charged with the
enforcement and application of the zoning ordinances with respect to all
matters in a Planned Unit Development established under Chapter
1266 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Springboro.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1266.02  PERMITTED USES; CATEGORIES OF PUDs.
   An application for PUD zoning shall specify the land use category being
requested. An application may specify areas proposed to be developed under
different PUD categories or under combinations of PUD categories. Once PUD
zoning is approved, land uses are limited by two factors: 1) the PUD category
for which application was made, and 2) the authority and discretion of the
Planning Commission, in its approval of the General Plan and/or Final
Development Plan, to determine which of the allowable uses in the category may
be permitted, in what intensity and location, and under what conditions. PUDs
may be applied for under any of the following land use categories:
   (a)   Planned Unit Development-Business (PUD-B) may allow any permitted use
in any Business Zoning District(see Section
1290.02(a)(105), Definitions);
   (b)   Planned Unit Development-Manufacturing (PUD-M) may allow any permitted
use in any Manufacturing Zoning District (see Section
1290.02(a)(105), Definitions);
   (c)   Planned Unit Development-Office (PUD-O) may allow any permitted use in
any Office Zoning District (see Section
1290.02(a)(105), Definitions);
   (d)   Planned Unit Development-Residential (PUD-R) may allow any permitted
use in any Residential Zoning District (see Section
1290.02(a)(105), Definitions); and
   (e)   Planned Unit Development-Mixed Use (PUD-MU) may allow any combination
of any permitted use in any Business, Manufacturing, Office, or Residential
Zoning District as defined in Section
1266.02.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1266.03  AREA, DENSITY AND LOT REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Minimum Development Area for a PUD.  A PUD shall contain a minimum of
1 acre. All land within the development shall be contiguous in that it shall
not be divided into segments by a limited access highway or by a tract of land
(other than streets or rights-of-way for public or private utility transmission
lines) not owned by the landowner of the PUD.
   (b)   Maximum Density Development. A PUD shall not exceed the gross density
permitted in the conventional zoning district on which it is based for the
portion of the PUD, as determined by the Planning Commission, with the
following exceptions:
      (1)   All densities are to be determined on the basis of gross dwelling
units per acre, excluding such acreage as is used for nonresidential purposes,
as determined by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Densities may be increased by the Planning Commission in the net
project area where the factors listed herein make a substantial improvement in
the PUD:
         A.   Landscaping; streetscape; open spaces and plazas; use of existing
landscape; pedestrian way treatment; and residential areas;
         B.   Setting, visual focus points; use of existing physical features
such as topography; view of sun and wind orientation; circulation pattern;
physical environment; variation in building setbacks; and building groups (such
as clustering);
         C.   Design features; street sections; architectural styles;
harmonious use of materials; parking areas broken by landscape features; and
varied use of building types; or
         D.   Common space above the district requirements.
         E.   Availability of contiguous publicly-owned open space, off-street
parking, storm water retention basins and other facilities which reduce the
need for such facilities within the PUD.
   (c)   Minimum Requirements.
      (1)   Dwelling unit size, yard setback, type of dwelling unit, frontage
restrictions, as established by conventional zoning on which it is based shall
apply, however these may be waived for PUDs, provided that the intent and
objectives of Section
1266.01 are complied within the total development plan, as determined by the
Planning Commission. Building separation shall be maintained in accordance with
the requirements of the Fire Prevention Code and other safety codes of the City
and in accordance with good design principles.

detention areas may be included in common space if attractively developed.
      (2)   For PUD-B, PUD-M. PUD-O, and the non-residential portions of a PUD-
MU no common space is required. The Planning Commission shall establish the
percentage of the lot dedicated as green space for all lots. This open space
shall not include structures, roadways and other paved areas, and other
impervious surfaces.
   (b)   Conveyance and Maintenance.  All common space, shown on the Record
Plan and recorded in the office of the Recorder of Montgomery or Warren County,
must be conveyed in accordance with the following methods, at the option of the
Planning Commission:
      (1)   By leasing or conveying title (including beneficial ownership) to a

other criteria and/or the need to provide a variety of development
opportunities within the community;
      (8)   The design of the development protects natural assets such as
streams, woodlots, steep terrain, and other critical environments in the City;

same time, the Final Development Plan corresponding to the Record Plan shall
also be recorded by the City.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1266.17  FAILURE TO BEGIN OR CONTINUE PLANNED UNIT  DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   The construction of a subdivision under PUD zoning is authorized by
agreement between the City and the land owner. This agreement, regardless of
its form, is a contract intended to assure the orderly construction of a
complete, well-planned development. Should the land owner breach this contract
by abandoning construction or failing to proceed with the development at the
pace agreed upon, the City shall be entitled to implement certain remedies, as
set forth in the following paragraphs.
   (b)   If a complete Record Plan approval application is not submitted within
12 months of the approval of a Final Development Plan, the Final Development
Plan shall be null and void. The Planning Commission, for good cause, may
extend for consecutive periods of 6 months the time for submitting the Record
Plan application. No more than 2 consecutive extensions may be granted.
   (c)   If no construction has begun in the PUD within 12 months after the
recording of a Record Plan for the overall project or any part thereof, the
Record Plan may be vacated by legislation of the City Council and be of no
further effect. The Planning Commission, for good cause, may extend for periods
of up to 6 months the time for beginning construction. No more than 2
consecutive extensions may be granted.
   (d)   Should a land owner who has been authorized to develop a PUD under
this Chapter
1266, or under any previous PUD regulations of the City, sell or otherwise
convey ownership of any part of that PUD to another before all planned public
improvements such as streets, curb cuts, and utilities are constructed therein
in accord with plans and specifications approved by the City, and/or before all
lands required for the public use therein have been dedicated to the City, that
land owner shall be deemed to have abandoned that portion of the PUD and to
have breached all agreements with the City to the extent that they relate to
development of the portion sold. In case of such abandonment and breach, the
City may, pursuant to a recommendation by the Planning Commission and approval
by the City Council, pursue any of the following remedies or any others
available to it under the law:
      (1)   Enforce the subdivider's contract executed by the breaching owner,
if such contract exists.
      (2)   Withdraw its approval of all plans for that portion of the PUD and
require any subsequent owner desiring to develop the site to begin with
submission of a proposed new General Plan. This remedy may be particularly
appropriate when the new land owner intends to be a subdivider of the conveyed
property.
      (3)   In a situation where the new owner wishes to continue the
development of a subdivision, require the new owner to execute a subdivider's
contract, performance bond and all other documents and assurances required by
the City to guarantee those dedications and public improvements which were not
completed by the former owner.
   (e)   In the event that the new owner and the City agree to implement the
third alternative, the new owner may proceed in accord with the approved Final
Development Plan, under the provisions of this Chapter. If for any reason the
subdivision has not received approval of a General Plan, Final Development Plan
and Record Plan, the new owner shall enter the review process set forth in this
Chapter to obtain any approval not obtained by the previous owner. Thereafter,
the new owner shall not deviate from the approved plans except through the
revision procedures of Section
1266.11, or by requesting and receiving a change of zoning classification.
   (f)   If an approved Record Plan is vacated as provided herein, notice of
such vacation shall be recorded in the records of Montgomery and/or Warren
County by the Planning Commission, and no development can proceed on any part
of the included lands until such time as a new Final Development Plan and
Record Plan have been submitted and approved.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1266.18  PHASING.
   The establishment of common spaces and the construction of public or common
residential facilities shown on the recorded Final Development Plan, together
with the construction of other nonresidential structures, shall proceed
substantially in accordance with the phasing program submitted pursuant to
Section
1266.12(n).
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1266.19  VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   Whenever the Planning Commission finds, in the case of an approved
Final Development Plan, that any term, condition or restriction incorporated
into the plan is not being complied with or performed, the Planning Commission
may rescind and revoke such approval. Notice of intent to revoke shall be
served upon the owner(s) by certified mail. Following opportunity for a hearing
before the Planning Commission, revocation may be certified by the Chairman of
the Planning Commission upon authorization by a majority of the Planning
Commission's membership. Notice of certification of such revocation shall be
promptly recorded in the land records of Montgomery and/or Warren County.
   (b)   Violation of an approved Final Development Plan for the PUD, as
approved, shall constitute a violation of this Zoning Code, punishable as
provided in Section
1288.02.

CHAPTER 1267
Town Center District
1267.01   Town Center District review process.
1267.02   Town Center design standards.
 
1267.01  TOWN CENTER DISTRICT REVIEW PROCESS.
   Town Center District Review Process. In addition to all zoning requirements
established in the Zoning Code, land within the designated TCD, Town Center
District shall be subject to the following review process:
   (a)   Each site development subject to Planning Commission review under
Chapter
1284, Site Plan Review, shall also be subject to review by the Architectural
Review Board for compliance with the Town Center Design Standards in Section
1267.02. Written confirmation by the Architectural Review Board to the Planning
Commission that a proposed site development is substantially in compliance with
the Town Center Design Standards shall be a mandatory prerequisite for site
plan approval by the Planning Commission under Chapter
1284.
   (b)   In its review of a proposed site development, the Architectural Review
Board shall have the discretion to apply its expertise in assisting the
applicant in achieving substantial compliance with the Town Center Design
Standards, and in identifying acceptable alternatives when literal compliance
with all standards may not be possible or desirable.
   (c)   Any alteration of a structure affecting less than 30 percent of its
area, as measured by square footage of the floor space, or structure height, or
of any elevation existing as of the date of enactment of Chapter
1267(Ordinance O-01-4, passed January 18, 2001), or as of the date of approval
of a site plan, shall be exempt from the TCD, Town Center District review set
forth in Chapter
1267.
      (Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1267.02  TOWN CENTER DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   Purpose.  These standards have been developed for the purpose of
assuring visual continuity throughout the Springboro Town Center area, to
protect the adjoining Olde Springboro Historic Preservation District, and to
establish standards for the design of buildings and related space and
amenities. The intent of the guidelines is to encourage continuity and
serviceability within a uniform approach to the various landscape situations
within the built environment of the Town Center. Although the site character is
comprised of separate elements; streetscape, site elements, landscape, and
architecture, each element is relative to all others on the site and
contributes to the overall design quality of the area. (Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-
19-15.)
   (b)   Signs.
      (1)   All signs shall comply with the provisions of Section
1281.10, Springboro Sign Code, Signs Permitted in Commercial Sign Districts. In
addition the following standards shall be applicable in the Town Center
District:
   (c)   (1)   A signage plan shall be prepared indicating the proposed
location of signage on the site and buildings.
         A.   All signs shall be constructed of the same material and designed
with the same texture, color, and shape.
         B.   All signs shall be designed with a consistent theme, regardless
of size or location on the building or site.
         C.   Signs poles, supports and other hardware shall be painted to
provide a unifying color.
         D.   Signage for a multi-tenant facility shall have a coordinated
character and combine information.
         E.   Signage lighting will be lit from below, and use consistent type
and style of light fixture.
         F.   Electronic message signs shall be permitted provided they comply
with Section
1281.10(d)(1) of the Sign Code.
            (Ord. O-18-7.  Passed 5-17-18.)
      (2)   Inappropriate Signage. In addition to signs prohibited in Chapter
1281, Signs, the following are prohibited in the Town Center District:
         A.   Signs on roofs, dormers or balconies
         B.   Signs painted directly on a structure
         C.   Signage (other than magnetic) attached to vehicles and parked
adjacent to building.
   (d)   Lighting.  Lighting can serve a multitude of functions from providing
a sense of safety to directing pedestrian and/or vehicular traffic. Lighting
can focus attention and accentuate a sign, feature or building. Consistent
lighting is an important factor in tying together disparate areas and a formal
lighting district is recommended for the Town Center District. All lighting,
including but not limited to building lighting, security lights, and
architectural lights should be from the same family of fixtures to maintain
continuity. Consistent material color, texture and design should be maintained.
All lighting shall be consistent with Chapter
1273, Exterior Lighting.
      (1)   Pedestrian Lighting.
         A.   Use a light hierarchy to distinguish between illumination
requirements.
         B.   Street lighting shall be placed to also offer illumination along
any adjacent walkways.
         C.   Walkway lighting shall employ a combination of overhead and
bollard fixtures.
      (2)   Inappropriate Lighting.  The following lighting installations are
unacceptable in the Town Center District:
         A.   Wall-pack lighting
         B.   Flashing/strobe-type or any neon-type lighting
         C.   Colored shields or lighting sources
   (e)   Site Furnishings. Streetscape furniture should be considered in terms
of compatibility with the architectural character of the site as well as
consistency with other streetscape elements, such as landscaping and paving
materials and can include items such as benches, bollards, banners, trash
receptacles, planters and bicycle racks.
      (1)   Site furnishings shall be consistent in design.
      (2)   Site furnishings shall be constructed of similar material,
preferably metal, stone or other natural materials that coordinate with the
building facades.
      (3)   Site furnishings such as benches, newsstands and trash receptacles
shall be clustered together in areas of activity, and be located to allow easy
access to entrances.
   (f)   Pedestrian Access.  Pedestrian walkways are an important feature in a
commercial area to communicate to visitors that pedestrians are welcome and
encouraged to walk from business to business. Pavement type is particularly
important, as it serves to differentiate between pedestrian and vehicular
circulation and cues the visitor to appropriate paths between destinations.
Modify to address site-level development standards not the entire Town Center.
      (1)   Pedestrian walkways are required along both sides of any roadway
within the Town Center area.
      (2)   Walkways must be wide enough to accommodate comfortable passing,
and shall be a minimum of 4 feet in width, and a maximum of 10 feet in width.
      (3)   Vary pavement materials to distinguish pedestrian circulation from
vehicular traffic at intersections. Brick pavers or a combination of brick and
concrete are a recommended paving material in areas where pedestrians and
vehicles share circulation.
      (4)   Brick pavers shall be within a color range to match other
recommended brick materials, or architectural or site elements within the Town
Center.
   (g)   Fences and Walls.  Fences and walls can be used as an organizing
feature in the streetscape by delineating a separation in uses or focusing
attention on a gateway, signage or pedestrian path. These elements can also
provide security from adjoining land uses or safety from vehicular traffic. In
addition to the provisions of Section
1272.04 , Fences, Walls and Hedges, the following shall apply:
      (1)   Fences shall be constructed of natural materials, such as wood or
iron rod.
      (2)   Any wood fences shall be traditional in design, split-rail type
wood fences are prohibited.
      (3)   Approved materials for wall construction include limestone, brick,
or fieldstone.
      (4)   Finished concrete wall structures are not permitted.
      (5)   Chain link is permitted for security purposes in areas that are not
along a public circulation route or viewable from a public circulation route.
   (h)   Parking.  Parking areas in the Town Center District must be accessible
to visitors but must also be screened from circulation routes.
      (1)   Parking is permitted beside or behind buildings, with access to the
lot at a point not located on the main road.
      (2)   Parking at the building side must maintain the build-to line of the
building setback.
      (3)   The maximum area of parking concentration is 150 spaces, these
areas may be configured in a contiguous manner, but must be separated by a
minimum 9-foot wide island, refer to parking lot perimeter planting for
landscape requirements.
      (4)   Allow shared parking between uses that have distinctly different
peak load times. See Section
1279.01.
      (5)   Encourage minimum parking area requirements with a reserve area
that can be used at a later time.
      (6)   Parking lot screening must follow those recommendations in Chapter
1280, Landscaping.
      (7)   New uses providing over 45 open off street parking spaces must
refer to the parking perimeter planting recommendations of Chapter
1280, Landscaping.
      (8)   Bicycle parking is recommended in the Town Center commercial areas.
See Chapter
1279, Parking.
   Separate pedestrian routes through parking lots are recommended, this can be
achieved by a variation in pavement material, color or location.
   (i)   Screening and Buffering. Any accessory elements such as ground
equipment including HVAC units, storage areas or accessory storage structures,
satellite dishes, and dumpsters, must be screened by means of landscaping,
walls or fencing.
   (j)   Architecture.
      (1)   Color. Paint colors shall harmonize with the natural material color
of the building material. When historically appropriate, concrete, brick,
stone, split-faced rock, or clay tile may be painted. Paint colors must reflect
the approved color scheme chosen by the City of Springboro.
      (2)   Massing.  Any new construction shall avoid long, monotonous
uninterrupted walls or roof planes. Articulation of the façade can reduce the
perceived size of the structure. This articulation can be achieved through the
appropriate placement of windows, doors, or offsets for each 100-foot length of
wall.
      (3)   Roofs. Roofs must be symmetrically pitched in the configuration of
gables and hips. Pitch slopes should range from 4:12 to 14:12. Shed roofs are
permitted if the ridge is attached to an exterior wall and must fall within the
4:12 to 14:12 range. Flat roofs are permitted if historically consistent with
the style of architecture, and must be edged with a parapet or railing.
         A.   Rooftop equipment, excluding solar energy systems as regulated in
Chapter
1276 of the Planning & Zoning Code, may not, at any time, be visible from
adjoining uses.

penetrations must be painted to match roof color.
         F.   Gutters shall be in accordance with the structure's architectural
style and visually integrated.
      (4)   Awnings.
         A.   Fixed or retractable awnings are permitted if they complement the
building's architectural style, material, color, and details.
         B.   An awning may not conceal architectural features (such as
cornices, columns, pilasters, or decorative details).
         C.   Metal and aluminum awnings are not permitted.
         D.   Awnings may be made of solution-dyed acrylic awning or marine
fabric, the material should be opaque.
         E.   Awning signage text may be screen-printed on the skirt or sewn
using same fabric type of white or translucent color.
         F.   Any signage text must comply with Chapter
1281.
         G.   Awning colors or patterns shall complement the color of the
building by matching or accenting the trim.
         H.   Awnings shall not be under lighted.
         I.   Awnings over an entrance shall be centered on the entrance with a
7-foot clearance between bottom of skirt and the pavement.

material that matches the façade.
      (6)   Building Height.  The required height of new structures is 2
stories (20 feet) or must have the appearance from front and sides of 2
stories. The maximum height should be thirty-five (35) feet at the roofline or
parapet wall as per City of Springboro ordinance.
      (7)   Façade Cladding.  Historically, cladding materials were chosen for
their appropriateness to building type. Materials for new construction may be
used if they emulate the appearance and quality of traditional materials. No
more than four and no less than three basic materials may be used in any
façade. Facades shall have a tripartite configuration; a base or foundation, a
middle or modulated wall, and a top portion formed by a pitched roof or
articulated cornice. Materials may not be changed in the same plane, unless
separated by a detail, such as a reveal, and change must occur along a
horizontal or vertical line. The lighter material should occur above the
heavier material in all cases. Building facades located on corner lots must
continue the same material on both sides and detail those facades similarly.
         A.   Appropriate Cladding. The following materials are appropriate for
use in the Town Center District:
            1.   Residential-size brick, traditional red color or other
neutral, non-glazed type
            2.   Stone facing material

regulated in Chapter
1276 of the Planning and Zoning Code.
      (8)   Doors and Windows.  Detail elements such as lintels, pediments,
pilasters, columns, and other design elements appropriate to the style of the
building shall be used to articulate entrances to buildings. The window
proportion and placement shall be compatible with the proportion of the
building.
         A.   Doors

   (f)   Design Standards.  Design standards were established to create a
unified image for Austin Center. High quality, mixed use developments in campus
settings with integrated open spaces, streets, and pedestrian facilities are
desired.
      (1)   Summary of Site Development Standards.
         A.   Utilize durable, long lasting building materials such as brick,
stone and decorative masonry block on all building walls facing I-75,
Miamisburg Springboro Pike, and SR 741.
         B.   Develop unique buildings that fit into the overall character and
design theme of Austin Center by requiring decorative architectural elements
and varied roof lines.
         C.   Place office and industrial buildings close to I-75 and all
surface streets, to create a strong identifiable image unique to Austin Center
with adequate room for tree preservation zones and/or landscape buffers.
         D.   Place parking lots in rear or side yards to make Austin Center's
structures the focal point of every development site.
         E.   Preserve and integrate existing tree stands, open spaces, and
scenic views on development parcels and along corridors to maintain Austin
Center's natural heritage.
         F.   Provide and require a non-motorized transportation system for the
exclusive use of pedestrians and bicyclists that provides safe linkages between
neighborhoods, businesses, recreational, and open space areas. Trails to be
designed following the most current bikeway design guidelines adopted by the
American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO).
         G.   Require consistent use of high quality, low profile monument
signage along all surface streets and encourage architecturally compatible wall
identification signs as required herein and pursuant to Chapter
1281.
      (2)   Architectural Standards.
         A.   Facades. Any building elevation of any structure facing I-75,
Miamisburg-Springboro Pike, and SR 741 shall be considered as a front side or
façade for design purposes.
         B.   Appropriate Façade Building Materials. Building facades shall be
constructed with decorative materials that provide long-term durability and
require low maintenance, such as: brick, stone, decorative masonry, or other
natural materials. Due to the nature of industrial businesses, split-face block
is an acceptable building material.
         C.   Unacceptable façade building materials. Building materials that
are generally not acceptable as the primary material include the following:
            1.   Exterior insulation finish systems (EIFS), such as Dryvit,
Sto-Wall and other brands;
            2.   Imitation wood, such as T-111 and other brands;
            3.   Plain concrete block and unadorned tilt up panel; and
            4.   Steel siding.
         D.   Glass. The use of glass is required but limited to 50 percent on
facades to avoid the excessive use of this material and a dated appearance. The
first floor of buildings should have a minimum of 25 percent glass to provide
variety, interest, and openness. Glass with a reflection greater than 20
percent is prohibited.
         E.   Main Building Entrances. Public entrances shall be inviting and
pronounced with lighting; high quality building materials; and architectural
elements that draw the eye to the opening such as decorative transoms, columns,
recesses, or protrusions. Combine different colors, textures and the before
mentioned architectural elements to emphasize entrances and to break the
monotony of large vertical surfaces. Public entrance vistas shall be
established or preserved by framing the area leading to the entrance with
landscaping. It is not the intent of the landscaping or screening requirements
found in this chapter to block the view of the primary building entrances.
Also, entrances should be designed with attention to pedestrian use, as well as
automobile drop-off convenience.
         F.   Architectural Details. Encourage use of recesses, off-sets,
arches, colonnades, columns, pilasters, detailed trim, brick bands, and
contrasting courses of material, cornices, or porches to vary building facades.
Vary roof lines with cantilevers, gables, parapets, and cornice lines. Screen
rooftop mechanical equipment, with the exception of roof-mounted solar energy
systems as regulated in Chapter
1276, with roof form.
         G.   Accents. Use canopies, overhangs, raised parapets over the door,
archways, awnings, larger openings and display windows, accent colors, and
details such as tile work, moldings, pedestrian-scale lighting, and distinctive
door pulls to add detail and additional interest to building designs.
         H.   Break Long, Flat Walls. Where buildings with long continuous
walls are oriented to the street, use contrasting architectural features to
provide visual relief and break the building mass at regular intervals no
greater than 100 feet by utilizing the architectural features suggested in the
above items.
      (3)   Yard and Bulk Requirements. It is desirable to establish setback
requirements to maintain consistency in building placement along Austin
Center's major thoroughfares. Building height and bulk should be the highest
adjacent to the interchange and decline gradually as the distance away from the
interchange increases.
         A.   Uniform front yard setback. A uniform front yard setback of 60
feet is required for buildings with frontage on Miamisburg-Springboro Pike and
SR 741. This setback is sufficient to provide the required area for tree
preservation zones or landscaped buffer yards next road rights-of-way yet does
not create an excessively large setback.
         B.   Other setbacks. Side and rear yard setbacks shall be the minimum
required to accommodate required buffer yards pursuant to subsection(4)C below.
         C.   Setback from Residential Districts. All industrial uses and
associated parking lots and loading facilities shall be located not less than
100 feet from land zoned or used for residential purposes. All office and other
nonresidential buildings and associated parking and loading facilities shall be
located not less than 50 feet from land zoned or used for residential purposes.
         D.   Maximum Lot Coverage and Open Space. Not more than 85 percent of
the area of any lot shall be covered with any combination of buildings,
pavement, or other impervious surfaces. Detention ponds, retention ponds, or
wetlands shall not account for more than 50 percent of the total required open
space area.
         E.   Building Height and Bulk. Building height and bulk should be the
greatest adjacent to the interchange. Multi-story structures are strongly
encouraged to be developed within a 1,000 foot radius from the Miamisburg-
Springboro Pike bridge at I-75 to create a pronounced gateway at the future
Austin Center Interchange.
      (4)   Landscaping Standards. Landscaping has a significant impact on the
quality of the environment. In addition to visual appeal, landscaping provides
an essential buffer and screen for undesirable features such as parking lots
and utility structures.
         A.   General Requirements. As a general guideline, a consistent
landscape program is required throughout Austin Center including a mix of
evergreen trees, canopy trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, and flowering ground
covers to provide an inviting environment.
         B.   Landscaping Adjacent to Rights-of-Way. Landscape buffer yards
shall be provided adjacent to the Miamisburg Springboro Pike, SR 741 and I-75
rights-of-way planted with mixture of shade trees, ornamental trees, bushes and
ground cover as required in the below table. A minimum screen height is
established to screen parking lots and industrial uses from rights-of-way.
Earth mounds, decorative walls, and dense vegetation can be used in any
combination to provide the required screening.
 
Use              Minimum Buffer Width Minimum Screen Minimum Plant
                                      Height         Materials
                                                     1 deciduous tree and
Office, Business 35 feet              30 inches      4 shrubs for every 20
                                                     lineal feet
                                                     1 deciduous tree and
Light Industrial 35 feet              4 ft.          4 shrubs for every 15
                                                     lineal feet
 
         C.   Landscape buffers between properties. The intent of buffer yards
is to reserve an appropriate area to screen: (1) different uses of land; (2)
screen parking lots from adjacent property; and (3) enhance the long term
attractiveness and vitality of Austin Center as an attractive employment center
through the judicious use of landscape materials such as trees, bushes and
shrubs in combination with earth mounds, desirable fences, and decorative
masonry walls. Buffer yards with required landscaping and screening materials
shall be provided adjacent to perimeter boundaries and between individual lots
as specified in the following tables:

                                          every 40 lineal feet.
B           20 Feet        3 feet         1 tree per 25 lineal feet with a
                                          minimum of 40% evergreen trees.
C           30 Feet        4 feet         1 tree per 20 lineal feet with a
                                          minimum of 50% evergreen trees.
D           40 Feet        5 feet         1 tree per 15 lineal feet with a
                                          minimum of 70% evergreen trees.
* No minimum screen height is required unless the Planning Commission finds
that screening is needed between similar uses that have varying degrees of
density or land use intensity.
 
         D.   Foundation Plantings. Buildings constructed at Austin Center
shall include foundation plantings around all elevations visible from the
public right-of-way. One tree shall be planted around the building and in the
adjacent yards for every 1,500 square feet of gross floor area for the first
20,000 square feet of building area plus one additional tree shall be required
for every 3,000 square feet of building floor area thereafter. This requirement
may be waived in part or in whole when substantial wood stands are preserved on
the development site.
         E.   Parking Lot Interior. Curbed (ODOT Barrier Curb Type 6) landscape
islands internal to parking lots are required to separate parking aisles,
direct traffic, and break large expanses of asphalt. Each island shall contain
shade trees, shrubs, ground cover and/or mulch. Ideally, a continuous landscape
island should be provided between every third parking aisle or, alternatively,
at the ends of each parking aisle and between every 12 parking spaces. Islands
should be large enough to protect vegetation from vehicular encroachment and to
store snow in the winter.
         F.   Treatment of Existing Vegetation. Existing site topography and
areas with substantial plant material, such as mature tree stands within
required buffer yards, setbacks and required open space shall be preserved to
the greatest extent possible and integrated into the overall site design to
preserve Austin Center's natural character and sense of place. Where healthy
trees of native species are preserved in areas other than required buffer yards
and setbacks, the Planning Commission may grant a reduction in the total number
of new trees required as indicated in the following table. Pursuant to Chapter
280 Tree Authority, any party wishing to remove a tree shall first submit a
permit to the City of Springboro. Any protected tree that is removed must be
replaced complaint with Section
280.04, Specific Removal Controls And Replacement Requirements, of the Codified
Ordinances.
 
Trunk diameter of Single Tree Reduction in Number of New
measured at DBH               Trees Required
4- 6 inches                   1 tree
6 - 14 inches                 2 trees
14 - 20 inches                3 trees
20+ inches                    4 trees
 
         G.   Modifications. The Planning Commission may grant modifications to
any buffer yard and general landscaping requirement where existing or proposed
vegetation meets the intent of these regulations, or when, because of the
unique shape, location, or character of the property, alternative landscaping
requirements would produce a more appealing landscape design. However, the
Planning Commission may require additional tree plantings or other landscape
elements where existing or proposed vegetation is sparse and/or the intent of
these regulations are not met. Existing plant material used in lieu of the
above buffer yard and general landscaping requirements shall be protected by
perpetual conservation easement.
         H.   Planting Standards. The following guidelines shall be followed:
            1.   The plant palette should emphasize native trees, shrubs,
ground cover which is hardy to this region. The City shall keep and revise a
list of preferred and prohibited species.
            2.   Deciduous trees shall have a DBH (diameter at breast height)
of at least 2.5 inches; Ornamental trees shall have DBH of at least 1.5 inches
and evergreen trees shall be at least 6 feet high at the time of planting.
Deciduous and evergreen shrubs shall be a minimum of 18 inches high at the time
of planting with no fewer than 6 main branches.
            3.   Plants shall be salt-spray tolerant, compatible with existing
soil conditions and tolerant of a wide range of conditions.
            4.   Creativity in landscape design is encouraged. The planting
design shall use massing or groupings of materials to create a stronger visual
impact for high speed areas, use plant diversity for long term health of the
plants, use repetition for continuity and create visual interest by
incorporating spring and summer flowers and fall color. The design shall
incorporate the Planning Commission's desired visual effect and, equally
important, the intent of the City to coordinate landscaping on adjoining
properties.
            5.   New landscaping should be naturalistic looking by being
sensitive to Austin Center's existing natural features. New landscaping should
blend with existing vegetation and topography. Earth mounds should undulate
horizontally and vertically to remove monotony from the landscape and to look
as naturalistic as possible.
            6.   Plants shall not be located where they might interfere with
overhead utilities or block visibility for pedestrians and motorists.
            7.   Landscape areas must be routinely maintained; dead and
diseased plant material shall be replaced; and irrigation to landscape areas is
strongly recommended.
      (5)   Screening Standards.  Proper placement of utilitarian features
enhances the effectiveness of screening. Mechanical equipment, trash
receptacles, and loading areas shall be located to the rear of the site and
should not be visible from any public right-of-way.
         A.   Mechanical equipment such as transformers and HVAC shall not be
located in front yards. All mechanical equipment, including both ground-mounted
and roof-mounted equipment, shall be screened from view from adjacent public
and private rights-of-way, as well as from all property zoned or used for
residential purposes, through the use of evergreen plantings or enclosures.
         B.   Trash receptacles shall be located in side or rear yards and
screened on 3 sides with durable building materials consistent in appearance
and materials with that of the principal building. The fourth side shall be
screened with an opaque gate with a lockable latch assembly. Bollards shall be
provided to protect adjacent vehicles from gate over-swing.
      (6)   Signs.  Consistent business signage is necessary for ease of way
finding and visual continuity. Low profile monument signs, rather than pole or
pylon signs, shall be used throughout Austin Center. Such signs should be
integrated into the overall site design, consistent in architectural style with
the building it advertises. Chapter
1281, of the Codified Ordinances shall control the specific sign requirements
with following additional provisions:
         A.   Prohibited Signs. Roofs signs, pole signs, pylon signs, and
billboards and highway signs are prohibited.
         B.   Ground Sign Requirements. Ground signs shall be monument signs
such as no support structures are visible. The sign base shall be constructed
of the same materials as the building, and the sign style shall be consistent
with the architecture of the building it advertises. Landscaping consisting of
shrubs, flowers, and accent stones shall be provided around the base of all
monument signs. Ground lighting should be flush with the grade or obscured by
landscaping. Internally illuminated ground signs are discouraged.
         C.   Signature wall sign. One signature wall sign is permitted at the
top of the building wall that faces I-75, provided that such sign does not
extend beyond the roof line or exceed 1 square feet in area for 1 foot of
building frontage not to exceed 150 square feet in area.
      (7)   Parking and Loading.
         A.   Prohibited Parking Lot Locations. Parking lots are prohibited
between the principal structure on each lot and Interstate 75, Miamisburg
Springboro Pike, or SR 741. This parking lot restriction shall apply only to
the frontage that contains the most traffic in cases where a lot has multiple
frontages.
         B.   Parking Lot Location Restrictions. Not more than two rows of
parking shall be placed in any front yard. Parking lots located in front and
side yards shall be screened in accordance with subsection (4)above.
         C.   Entrances. Parking lot entrances and exits shall be designed to
enhance the flow of traffic into or out of the parking lot, thereby reducing
congestion and traffic hazards. There shall be sufficient maneuvering room for
vehicles to enter and leave the lot.
         D.   Pedestrian Circulation. A safe transition shall be provided for
people walking from their vehicles to the building, or for pedestrians or
bicyclists using a public pathway to the building entrance. The design of the
parking lot should minimize areas where vehicular traffic moves in the same
space with pedestrians. Walkways shall be curbed and elevated higher than
parking lots to place pedestrians at a higher level than vehicular traffic.
         E.   Loading Bays. Loading bays shall not face I-75, Miamisburg
Springboro Pike, and SR 741 or be visible from any other right-of- way or
residential district. Loading areas shall be screened from view from local
streets and residential districts by an opaque barrier consisting of a
decorative screen wall consistent in appearance and materials with that of the
principal building, continuous evergreen planting, or some combination thereof.
         F.   Bicycle Parking. Multi-use paths are planned throughout Austin
Center. Bicycle parking should be provided next to building entrances or at
safe and convenient locations within parking lots. Permanently fixed bicycle
parking racks should be provided near building entrances following guidelines
established by the Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle Professionals (APBP).
      (8)   Pedestrian Amenities/Circulation. Bike paths or sidewalks should
extend into each site development from the existing or planned Austin Center
bike path and sidewalk system. The intent is to offer a range of non-motorized
commuting and recreational options for employees, residents and visitors of the
area. The Planning Commission may reduce the number of parking spaces required
for the provision of bicycle parking facilities and a well- designed non-
motorized circulation system.
         A.   Link buildings and main entrances to the public sidewalk system
and multi-use paths.
         B.   Connect office and industrial buildings to nearby common areas,
open spaces, and retail areas.
         C.   Establish pedestrian connections between employment centers and
adjacent neighborhoods.
         D.   Incorporate plazas, courtyards, and arcades into developments
with a variety of furniture, fountains, landscaping, decorative lighting, art,
and clock towers, etc., to promote activity during breaks. Such spaces should
be linked to building entrances, parking lots, and the public sidewalk/path
system. Such areas can be constructed on individual lots or in common areas.
Plazas and courtyards that serve more than one building are encouraged to
promote increased use, activity and a welcoming community environment.
      (9)   Storm Drainage.
         A.   "Wet" retention ponds should be encouraged as community site
amenities. Such ponds shall be designed with a gradual slope (6:1) and
naturalistic shape. A gradual slope promotes greater environmental value and
eliminates the need for unattractive fencing. The edge of ponds should be lined
with stone to minimize erosion caused by wind rippling. "Dry" detention areas,
where required, should be located on the site to reduce their visibility and/or
obscured with landscaping.
         B.   Common drainage facilities should be encouraged whenever possible
to avoid multiple, small facilities that are unattractive and that result in
long-term maintenance problems. The location and common drainage features
should be identified early in the development stage of large sites so that
sufficient area is reserved in advance of development.
         C.   Common drainage facilities will necessitate the submission of
common maintenance agreements to provide for equitable contributions by each
separate landowner using the facility. Such agreements should be required and
reviewed during the site plan review process to ensure that maintenance
responsibilities are properly defined and that common area fees are sufficient.
      (10)   Site Lighting. The provision of sufficient lighting is an
important design feature that affects the overall appearance of a site during
the day and provides significant impact on the safety of property at night.
Site lighting shall conform to the requirements found in Chapter
1273, Exterior Lighting.

CHAPTER 1269
ADD-2, Austin Development District 2
1269.01   Requirements; uses; standards.
 
1269.01  REQUIREMENTS; USES; STANDARDS.
   (a)   Purposes. The purpose of the ADD-2, Austin Development District 2, is
to implement that certain Court Order, entered by the Montgomery County Common
Pleas Court litigation between the then owners of the ADD-2, Austin Development
District property, GCC AUSTIN, LTD. Wooster Associates, and Victory 4, LLC, and
the City of Springboro, Ohio, Case No. 2003-CV-1166 (Court Order). Among other
things, the Court Order establishes a process to be followed in the development
of the ADD-2, Austin Development District.
   (b)   Definitions.
      (1)   Development Parcel. That certain parcel consisting of approximately
54 acres +/- identified as "Development Parcel" as set forth on the attached
Map A subject to change pursuant to the Court Order. If the Development Parcel
changes pursuant to the Court Order, this subsection (b)(1) and Map A shall be
amended to reflect said change.
      (2)   TIF Roads. Map A attached, shows schematically a system of public
streets anticipated to be constructed upon the Development Parcel and other
property. A portion of those streets are identified on Map A as "TIF Roads".
The locations of the TIF Roads may be changed pursuant to the Court Order,
provided that the TIF Roads as so relocated shall provide public street access
from Miamisburg Springboro Pike to the contiguous property located to the
southwest of the Development Parcel that is at least substantially as direct as
the access provided by the TIF Roads shown on Map A. The TIF Roads shall be
dedicated, constructed and paid for as provided for in Section 13 of the Court
Order.
      (3)   Comprehensive Plan. The Court Order constitutes an amendment to the
City's Comprehensive Land Use Master Plan, only as it relates to the
Development Parcel, to provide for land uses and procedures for implementing
those uses on the Development Parcel consistent with the uses provided for on
Map A attached. This Chapter
1269  implements the City's Comprehensive Land Use Master Plan as amended by
the Court Order.
      (4)   PUD Development Standards. The development standards for the
Development Parcel are those provided for in the PUD Planned Unit Development
District of the Springboro Zoning Code in effect on September 3, 2004 and as
described in Chapter 6 of the Austin Interchange Land Use and Development Plan-
Final Draft dated May 13, 2004 (Austin Plan) except that, where the provisions
of this Chapter
1269 of the Springboro Ordinances are less restrictive, more restrictive or
otherwise in conflict with said development standards, the provisions of the
Chapter
1269 shall control.
      (5)   Site Layout Plan. Map A constitutes the Site Layout Plan for the
Development Parcel until the Site Layout Plan shown on Map A is amended by one
or more POD Plan approvals hereinafter described, or is adjusted as otherwise
set forth herein; and  after one or more such amendments or adjustments, the
Site Layout Plan approved by City Council as part of the most recent such
amendment or adjustment. At all times the Site Layout Plan then in effect shall
control development of the Development Parcel as the basis for approval of
final development plans. Any changes in the boundaries of the Development
Parcel pursuant to the Court Order shall result in adjustment of the Site
Layout Plan to cause the "Hospitality/Restaurant/Office" designation on Map A
to include the newly adjusted Development Parcel boundaries. Concurrently with
the issuance by ODOT and/or Montgomery County of an access plan for Miamisburg/
Springboro Pike or Springboro Pike which eliminates, relocates or reconfigures
any of the Intersections or with any refusal by ODOT and/or Montgomery County
to approve an Intersection or with any requirement by ODOT and/or Montgomery
County that an Intersection be relocated or configured, the Site Layout Plan
shall be adjusted to make changes consistent therewith to the road system and
use designations on the Development Parcel. Each adjustment to the Site Layout
Plan pursuant hereto shall be approved by City Council by motion as an
administrative action. The Site Layout Plan:
         A.   Is compatible with the location, topographic, and other
characteristics of the site and surrounding land uses;
         B.   Is carefully designed to support surrounding streets, utilities
and other public improvements;
         C.   Represents an efficient and economic use of the land in view of
the community's need for a balance of land uses; and
         D.   Appears capable of being implemented by a Final Development Plan
that meets all of the review and approval requirements set forth herein.
      (6)   Public Streets. Map A shows locations at which public streets
anticipated to be constructed on the Development Parcel would intersect with
Miamisburg Springboro Pike and Springboro Pike, respectively, subject to
possible relocation as herein provided.

ATTACHMENT I
1269.01, CD-Consent Decree District Springboro Ordinances
(
1269.01(b)(7))
   In addition to complying with the applicable requirements set forth in the
Court Order, development of the Development Parcel shall comply with the
following requirements:
A.    Uses. The permitted use limitations and use restrictions herein set forth
shall be the uses permitted on the Development Parcel within the respective
areas identified on the Site Layout Plan.
   1.    All parking areas on the Development Parcel are subject to the
landscaping and screening standards set forth in chapter 6 E and F of the
Austin Plan. All parking for each use which is located within the areas
"Retail/Restaurant" and "Office/Bank" on the Site Layout Plan (Map A as amended
from time to time as provided in
1269.01), must be located behind a line which is the front face (the face
fronting on Miamisburg Springboro Pike or Springboro Pike) of the building (not
including bays, porches, entryways and other minor projections) on the same
parcel as that use, as that line is extended to the side property lines, except
that, in the area in front of that line, head-in parking along the side
property lines and two rows of parking in front of that line shall be
permitted. Parking for uses not located in the areas designated "Retail/
Restaurant" and "Office/Bank" on the Site Layout Plan are not subject to any
restriction as to where that parking will be located.
   2.    All buildings shall be constructed of high quality materials such as
wood, brick, stone, cultured stone, cultured brick, E1FS, and architectural
glass. No split-faced or smooth block will be permitted except (a) as accent
material, (b) on façades which do not face public streets or (c) in the areas
marked "Office/Light Manufacturing" or "Office/Light Manufacturing/Medical
Facilities" (if applicable) as shown on the most recently approved Site Layout
Plan.
   3.    The location of dumpsters is subject to Final Development Plan review.
   4.    Each retail store in any multi-store building shall have a separate
and distinct façade. The intent is to reduce the negative impact of "strip
centers" that all look alike. Architectural treatment of such building to break
up large expanses and linear structures is required.
   5.    No hospitality use may have outside access into individual guest
rooms.
   6.    Not more than one (1) gasoline service station shall be permitted on
the Development Parcel. It may include a fully enclosed car wash with opaque
walls, a convenience store and facilities for the sale of foods and beverages
prepared on the premises. If a gasoline service station is constructed on the
Development Parcel, it must be constructed within the "Highway Service" area
identified on the Site Layout Plan. Co-branding is permitted at the facility
provided for in this item 6. to allow a gasoline service station, convenience
store and sale of foods and beverages prepared on site to be operated under
different names.
   7.    Not more than one (1) structure housing a "fast-food" restaurant shall
be permitted on the Development Parcel, including any fast-food restaurant that
may be operated in conjunction with a gasoline service station provided in item
6. If a "fast-food" restaurant is constructed on the Development Parcel, it
must be constructed within the "Highway Service" area identified on the Site
Layout Plan. For purposes of this item 7, a "fast food" restaurant is a
restaurant at which food and drinks are ordered and picked up by the customer
only at a counter and not at a dining table and which has a food and beverage
drive-through facility. If a fast food restaurant is operated in conjunction
with a gasoline service station provided in item 6, no additional structure
housing a "fast-food" restaurant shall be permitted on the Development Parcel.
If a fast food restaurant is not operated in conjunction with a gasoline
service station provided in item 6, co-branding is permitted in the structure
provided for in this item 7, to allow not more than two (2) restaurants to be
operated under different names in that structure. If such a restaurant
structure is constructed on the Development Parcel, it may include no more than
two  drive-throughs with a separate lane for each drive-through for a total of
two drive-through lanes for the entire building. None of the restrictions in
this item B shall apply to the construction and operation of multiple "fast
casual" restaurants on other portions of the Development Parcel such as Panera
Bread, Boston Market, Chipotle and other similar facilities at which customers
place orders and pick up their orders at a counter rather than a dining table
and may generally take away their food and drink for consumption off premises,
provided that they do not operate with a food and beverage drive-through
facility.
   8.    Except as permitted in the next sentence, no individual retail store
on the Development Parcel shall exceed 30,000 square feet of floor space. One
(1) retail store initially having up to 90,000 square feet of floor space (the
"Anchor Store") shall be permitted on the Development Parcel. The Anchor Store
shall be permitted to expand up to 20,000 additional square feet if the
expansion is constructed generally within the area designated for the expansion
on the Final Development Plan approved for the initial development of the
Anchor Store.
   9.    Single price point retailers (for example, Dollar General, Family
Dollar, etc.) shall not be permitted on the Development Parcel.
   10.   No outdoor display, storage or sale of merchandise may occur in areas
approved or designated for parking.
B.    For purposes of this Attachment I "Food Store" or "Supermarket" shall
mean a food store or similarly merchandised store offering a multi-departmental
full service grocery/food facility including on-premise production or sale of
premanufactured perishable products. A Food Store or Supermarket shall not be
operated within the Anchor Store covering a floor area greater than ten
thousand (10,000) square feet. Five (5) years after the Anchor Store opens to
the public, or ten (10) years after June 20, 2005, whichever occurs earlier,
the Food Store/Supermarket use in the Anchor Store may expand to no more than a
maximum floor area of 30,000 square feet.
C.    For the purpose of this text, "retail space" and "retail store" do not
include restaurants or hospitality facilities, even if sales of goods other
than foods and beverages occur at those facilities.
D.    The uses identified on the Site Layout Plan, (Map A) that are not
described above shall have the following meanings:

1273.02   Approved site plan required.
1273.03   Maintenance.
1273.04   Exemptions.
 
1273.01  PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND.
   It is the intent of this Chapter to regulate outdoor lighting in a manner
that establishes appropriate minimum levels of illumination, prevents
unnecessary glare, reduces light trespass onto adjacent properties and reduces
unnecessary transmission of light into the night sky. These provisions are not
intended to eliminate the need for an applicant to seek out professional
assistance to determine appropriate lighting for the use and design proposed.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1273.02  APPROVED SITE PLAN REQUIRED.
   (a)   Whenever the installation or modification of outdoor lighting is part
of a development that requires site plan approval, the Planning Commission
shall review and approve all proposed lighting as part of its site plan
approval process.
      (1)   Lighting plan contents.  A lighting plan submitted for review shall
contain the following:
         A.   A site plan showing the location of all existing and proposed
buildings, zoning, landscaping, streets, drives, parking areas and exterior
lighting fixtures.
         B.   Specifications for all proposed and existing lighting fixtures
including photometric data, fixture height, mounting and design, glare control
devices, type and color rendition of lamps, and hours of operation. A
photometric plan illustrating the levels of illumination at ground level shall
account for all light sources that impact the subject site, including light
trespass from and to neighboring properties. This information may be deferred
to the final site plan if the site is not adjacent to a residential district.
         C.   Relevant building elevation drawing showing all fixtures, the
portions of the walls to be illuminated, luminance levels of walls and the
aiming points of any remote fixtures.
         D.   A photometric analysis of the proposed lighting plan using
standards established by the Engineering Department.
         E.   Other information necessary to meet this ordinance's requirements
as determined by the Planning Commission or the Director of Planning.
      (2)   Lighting plan approval criteria. A proposed lighting plan shall be
reviewed based upon the following considerations:
         A.   Whether the lighting is designed to minimize glare;
         B.   Whether the light will be directed beyond the boundaries of the
area to be illuminated or onto adjacent properties or streets;
         C.   Whether the lighting will cause negative impacts on residential
districts and uses;
         D.   Whether the plan will achieve appropriate levels of illumination
for the use proposed, as required by this Ordinance;
         E.   Whether the lighting is in harmony with the character of the
surrounding area and the illumination levels of neighboring properties; and
         F.   Whether the lighting is in keeping with the City's goal of
prohibiting unnecessary illumination of the night sky.
      (3)   Design standards.  When site plan approval is required for the
installation or modification of exterior lighting, the following conditions
shall apply:
         A.   Light fixtures shall not be mounted in excess of the maximum
height limitation of the district in which they are located. For lighting in
residential districts and for uses adjacent to a residential district or use,
light fixtures shall not be mounted in excess of 25 feet above grade. Fixture
height shall be measured from the grade of the illuminated surface to the top
of the fixture.
         B.   Electrical service to the light fixtures shall be placed
underground.
         C.   No flashing or moving lights shall be permitted.
         D.   Glare control shall be accomplished primarily through the proper
selection and application of lighting equipment. Only after those means have
been exhausted shall landscaping, fencing and similar screening methods be
considered acceptable means for reducing glare.
         E.   Outdoor lighting shall be designed to achieve uniform
illumination levels. The ratio of the average light level of the surface being
lit to the lowest light level of the surface being lit, measured in foot-
candles, shall not exceed a ratio of 4-to-1. In no case shall the maximum to
minimum light levels exceed a ratio of 10-to-1 between any 2 points on a lot.
         F.   Outdoor lighting shall be designed to present a uniform color
temperature on a site, building or development insofar as the lighting shall
have a color temperature of 3500 degrees Kelvin (K) or less.
         G.   Lighting for security purposes and limited operations shall be
maintained after hours of operation between 0.2 foot-candles and the minimum
permitted in Table 9.
         H.   Lighting for security purposes shall be directed only onto the
area to be secured:
            1.   All fixtures shall be located, shielded and aimed so that
light is not cast toward adjacent properties or streets or unnecessarily
transmitted into the night sky.
            2.   Fixtures mounted on the building and designed to illuminate
the facade are preferred.
         I.   Parking lot lighting shall be designed to provide the minimum
illumination necessary to ensure adequate vision and comfort in parking areas.
Fully shielded fixtures shall be used to prevent glare and direct illumination
away from adjacent properties and streets. Designs that result in even levels
of illumination across a parking area are preferred.
         J.   The illumination of vehicle fueling stations, drive through
operations (areas directly associated with the drive through itself, not the
entire use or property) and convenience stores shall not exceed 10 foot-candles
as measured at any one point. Excessive lighting for the purposes of attraction
and advertising shall not be permitted.
         K.   Areas not associated with fuel pump islands or drive throughs
such as those used for parking and vehicle storage shall be illuminated in
accordance with the parking area requirements of subsection (a)(3)N.
         L.   Light fixtures mounted on canopies shall be recessed or flush
with the bottom of the canopy. Where a drop-down fixture is used, the lens
shall be flush with (i.e., no more than one inch beyond) the casing so that
light is directed down and not sideways. All canopy lighting shall be shielded
to provide a cut-off angle of 85 degrees. Fixtures shall not be mounted on the
top or sides of canopies.
         M.   The illumination of canopy sides shall be prohibited.
         N.   The following illumination levels shall act as minimum standards
for all exterior lighting. Maximum lighting will be governed by the 4-to-
1 ratio of average to minimum illumination of the surface being lit standards
identified in subsection (a)(3)E. above; in no case shall the maximum lighting
level exceed the maximum identified in the table below. Where a site abuts a
nonresidential district, maximum illumination at the property line shall not
exceed 1 foot-candle. The Director of Planning or Planning Commission, as
applicable, may modify these levels or place conditions on their application
(e.g., the installation of screening such as an open buffer, landscaping, wall,
or fence) if such modifications are deemed necessary and appropriate for the
use and surrounding area.

*The illumination measured in foot-candles at ground level.
The minimum illumination during non-business hours shall be 0.2 foot-candles.
         O.   Where a site abuts a residential district or use, the following
special conditions shall apply:
            1.   The height of light fixtures shall not exceed the maximum
height prescribed in subsection (a)(3)A.
            2.   All fixtures shall be fully shielded.
            3.   No direct light source shall be visible at the property line
(adjacent to residential) at ground level.
            4.   Maximum illumination at the property line shall not exceed 0.5
foot-candles.
For the purposes of this ordinance, the O-R, Office- Residential District shall
be considered a residential district due to its status as a transition between
more intensive retail and residential districts.
         P.   The Planning Commission may choose to waive or alter fully
shielded light fixture requirements of this section when appropriate historic
or decorative fixtures are proposed (e.g., the use of decorative up-lighting to
illuminate the underside of a canopy or columns on a facade, where a canopy or
roof projection restricts the projection of the light into the night sky).
            (Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)

repairing broken or malfunctioning fixtures and similar activities. Failure to
maintain fixtures shall be deemed a violation of the Planning and Zoning Code
and/or the Property Maintenance Code of the City of Springboro.
   (b)   On the repair, replacement, or relocation of any fixture, the fixture
shall be brought into compliance with these requirements. Existing fixtures
that are currently not in compliance with these requirements do not need to be
brought in compliance until such time as any repair, replacement, or relocation
of the fixture is performed.

      (Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1278.04  CONTENTS.
   The traffic impact analysis shall contain the following for the specified
impact study area:
   (a)   Road Network.  A detailed description of the collector and arterial
road network, including existing and programmed roadway lanes and lane right-
of-way widths; existing and programmed traffic signal locations and signal
phasing; existing and planned ingress and egress locations for development
mutually served by major roadway facilities with the proposed development
(including all access locations adjacent to and within 600 feet of the proposed
development property lines); and existing and programmed public transportation
services and facilities.
   (b)   Development Details. A description of development, including phasing
and anticipated completion dates.
   (c)   Existing Conditions. A detailed description of the existing traffic
conditions, including the average daily traffic and traffic during the peak
a.m. and p.m. hours.
   (d)   Capacity Analyses. Capacity analyses shall be conducted at the
intersections of all major roadways in the impact area that are signalized or
that warrant signalization.
   (e)   Level of Service Impact. Based on the capacity analyses described in
sub-paragraph (d) above, a summary of existing levels of service on the impact
area network shall be provided.
   (f)   Traffic Impacts. The following components shall be submitted to the
City prior to a Detailed Cumulative Transportation Impact Analysis:
      (1)   Trip Generation.  Indicate daily and a.m. and p.m. peak hour trip
generation data. Peak hour trip generation data should reflect the impact
anticipated during the existing street peak hour on the adjacent street. The
analysis shall show in tabular form the land use components, the trip
generation rates, and the total trips generated by land use type. Daily and
peak hour trip generation, as well as inbound/outbound direction split shall be
based on the report entitled "Trip Generation (latest edition)" by the
Institute of Transportation Engineers, or its successors, except when special
trip generation research conducted by the person preparing the traffic impact
analysis demonstrates alternative data to be more appropriate.
      (2)   Internal/External Split. Indicate the internal/external split and
pass-by trips for daily and peak hour travel. The analysis shall indicate the
basis for capturing internal and external trips.
      (3)   Trip Distribution. Indicate the basis for determining trip
distribution for the proposed development and the resultant trip distribution
by cardinal direction (north, south, east, and west).
      (4)   Trip Assignment. Identify the trip assignment (daily and peak hour)
within the study area. Daily volumes shall be noted along roadway links. Peak
hour volumes shall be reflected in turning movements at development entrances
and major roadway intersections.
   (g)   Detailed Cumulative Transportation Impact Analysis. This analysis
shall include existing traffic, traffic growth due to other approved
development, and the impact of the proposed development.
      (1)   This analysis must identify projected average daily and peak hour
volumes for all collector and arterial roadways and intersections and must
identify the development impact separately from the cumulative traffic volume.
For the purposes of these analyses, background traffic shall be identified as
existing plus other approved development traffic. Other development traffic
shall be identified by using actual traffic analyses for approved projects and
historical growth trends on the subject roadways as appropriate.
      (2)   Capacity analyses shall be conducted to identify levels of service
resulting from the cumulative traffic demands, including the proposed
development. When the combination of background traffic and the impact from the
subject development will reduce the Level of Service (LOS) below LOS C,
analyses shall be conducted to identify those improvements required to maintain
acceptable LOS standards, as determined by the City Engineer or applicable
agency/entity. If the current use is LOS C or below, the LOS must be preserved
or improved as determined by the City Engineer or applicable agency/entity.
These improvements shall be identified clearly. When determining acceptable LOS
standards, the City shall use the most recent versions of the Highway Capacity
Manual and AASHTO Geometric Design of Highways and Streets.
         (Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1278.05  TRAFFIC STUDY AND TRAFFIC DATA INVENTORY AND FILE.
   The City Engineer shall keep a file of all traffic studies, including the
capacity allocated for each approved project. In determining the projected
demand in Section
1278.04(g)above the impact analysis shall include trips already allocated in
previous development approvals. The City Engineer shall provide information
when appropriate data already exists and is available in order to prevent
duplication.

Footnote to Table 11: The number of van accessible spaces are part of, and not
in addition to, the total number of accessible spaces required.
      (9)   Pedestrian Circulation.  Parking and loading areas, maneuvering
lanes and curb cuts shall be designed to cause no interference with safe and
convenient movement of automobile and pedestrian traffic on and adjacent to a
site.  Parking lots shall also conform to the following to ensure safe
pedestrian movement within and adjacent to parking areas:
         A.   Separation. The parking lot layout shall accommodate direct and
continuous pedestrian circulation, clearly divided from vehicular areas.
         B.   Crosswalks. Where pedestrian crosswalks are proposed or required,
the crosswalks shall be distinguished by textured paving, pavement striping or
raised or table striping, and integrated into the sidewalk network.
         C.   Pavement Markings. Pavement markings such as directional arrows
on and flush with the pavement shall be provided, as approved by the City
Engineer.
         D.   Traffic Control Signs. Traffic control signs including but not
limited to stop, yield or pedestrian crossing signs shall be provided.

for Accessible Design.
   (e)   Number of Parking Spaces Required.
      (1)   Units of measure and means of off-street parking requirement
calculation. In computing the requirement for off-street parking spaces, the
following units of measure shall be uses:
         A.   Whenever the number of off-street parking spaces required is
determined by gross square feet of floor area, it shall be measured from the
exterior surface of exterior walls or from the center line of walls separating
buildings.
         B.   In the case of benches, pews and similar seating accommodations,
each 18 inches thereof shall be counted as 1 seat for the purpose of
determining the parking requirements.
         C.   Where fractional spaces result, the parking spaces required shall
be construed to be the nearest whole number.
         D.   In the case of mixed-use sites or shopping centers, the parking
spaces required shall be 5 parking spaces per 1,000 square feet.
         E.   Parking spaces designated for use by vehicle fleets shall not be
credited to the parking requirement.
         F.   The maximum occupancy of a use shall be determined by the
Building Inspector or Fire Inspector.
      (2)   Minimum off-street parking space requirements for specific land
uses. The minimum number of off-street parking spaces required shall be
calculated using Table 12in this section:

residential uses half of all spaces shall be covered. Shelters, bicycle
lockers, or other methods of protecting the parked bicycles are encouraged. 
Bicycle parking spaces may be located anywhere on the site, including inside
the building, and need not be located within the boundaries of the vehicle
parking lot, but shall be located proximate to building entrances.  Bicycle
parking siting and design shall be consistent with Bicycle Parking Guidelines
published by the Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle Professionals.
   (g)   Other Provisions.
      (1)   Allowance for Shared Parking. The Planning Commission may accept a
site plan that satisfies the off-street parking requirements by use of off-
site shared parking with the City or another nonresidential user. In
determining whether to accept the proposed site plan, the Planning Commission
may consider the proximity and accessibility of the off-site location to the
proposed development site, the hours of operation of both users, the number of
spaces available and required for each business and the compatibility of uses.
A legal agreement by the applicable parties for shared parking must be reviewed
by the City Law Director, approved by the Planning Commission, and recorded by
the City.
      (2)   Reduction of off-street parking requirements in certain
circumstances.
         A.   On-Street Parking: Excluding parking for residential uses, the
parking requirement for uses where on-street parking is provided on adjacent
rights-of-way, may be reduced to 50 percent  of the minimum requirement
identified in Table 12 above.
         B.   More Appropriate Parking Standard for Land Use. The Director of
Planning may require fewer parking spaces upon making a determination that the
use can be adequately serviced by fewer parking spaces.

1280.04  REQUIRED LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING.
   (a)   Ground Cover. All unpaved and undeveloped portions of the site shall
be planted with grass, ground cover, shrubbery, or other suitable plant
material, which shall extend to any abutting street edge.
   (b)   Preservation Existing Vegetation. Existing site topography and areas
with substantial plant material, such as mature tree stands within required
buffer yards, setbacks and required open space shall be preserved to the
greatest extent possible and integrated into the overall site design to
preserve the City's natural character and sense of place. Where healthy trees
of native species are preserved in areas other than required buffer yards and
setbacks, the Planning Commission may grant a reduction in the total number of
new trees required as indicated in the following table. Pursuant to Chapter
280 Tree Authority, any party wishing to remove a tree shall first submit a
permit to the City of Springboro. Any protected tree that is removed must be
replaced complaint with Section
280.04, Specific Removal Controls and Replacement Requirements, of the Codified
Ordinances.

   (d)   Buffers.  The intent of buffer yards is to reserve an appropriate area
to screen: (1) different uses of land; (2) screen parking lots from adjacent
property; and (3) enhance the long term attractiveness and vitality of the City
through the use of landscape materials such as trees, bushes and shrubs in
combination with earth mounds, desirable fences, and decorative masonry walls.
As such, the only development permitted in a buffer yard are sidewalks and
bicycle paths. Buffer yards with required landscaping and screening materials
shall be provided adjacent to perimeter boundaries and between individual lots
as specified in the following tables:

Note 1: No minimum screen height is required unless the Planning Commission
finds that screening is needed between similar uses that have varying degrees
of density of land use intensity.
Note 2: Uses in the Historic District shall be exempt from the requirement to
install buffer landscaping.
 
Footnotes to Table 15:
   (1)   Landscape requirements apply only to subdivision or condominium
development in one family residential zoning districts. The buffer yard may be
accommodated on or within lots, and need not be provided in a separate
landscape area.
   (2)   Where the rear yard of lots or units in a plat or condominium face a
perimeter road, a minimum 8 foot tall opaque screen shall be provided along the
entire length of frontage. Such screen may be provided by preserving existing
vegetation and/or by additional plantings.
   (3)   In respect to the designation of Interstates 75 and State Routes 73
and 741, such designations are not zoning districts. It is intended that the
buffer and screening shall be for development in any zoning district with
frontage along an interstate or state route where the rear yard faces the
street right of way.
   (4)   Residential Buffers. All required buffers within residential
developments must be placed within defined landscape buffer easements and may
not be part of any individual residential lot.
   (5)   Existing Vegetation. The buffer or planting requirements may be waived
or modified by the Planning Commission if existing vegetation will provide an
equal or greater screen than that required in Table 15. If existing vegetation
is removed or damaged during construction, buffer plantings shall be provided
in accordance with the requirements of Table 15.
   (e)   Parking Lot Landscaping.
      (1)   Parking Lot Screening along Central (SR 73) and North Main (SR
741). Parking located along Central (SR73) and North Main (SR 741) that are
located in front or on the side of a building shall be screened from the
Central (SR 73) and North Main (SR 741) with a 3-foot high brick or stone wall,
evergreen landscaping, berm, or approved alternative. Appropriate species of
evergreens shall be chosen, and dwarf species are recommended in the interest
of minimizing pruning and maintaining the natural form of the plant material.
      (2)   Internal Parking Lot Landscaping. Landscape islands internal to
parking lots are required to separate parking aisled, direct traffic, and break
large expanses of impervious surfaces. Required landscaping elsewhere on the
lot shall not be counted in meeting the parking lot landscaping requirements
(see Figure 9 below).
         A.   Landscape Ratio. Off-street parking areas containing greater than
15 spaces shall be provided with at least 10 square feet of interior
landscaping per parking space.
         B.   Minimum Area. Landscaped areas in parking lots shall be no less
than 5 feet in any single dimension and no less than 150 square feet in area.
Landscaped areas in or adjacent to parking lots shall be protected with curbing
or other means to prevent encroachment of vehicles.
         C.   Required Plantings. Requirements for plant material shall be
based on the location, size, and shape of the parking lot landscaped area. A
minimum of 1 tree shall be planted per 300 square feet or fraction thereof of
interior landscaped area. At least 50 percent of each interior landscaped area
shall be covered by living plant material, such as sod, shrubs, ground cover,
or trees.

IMAGES/0-0-0-4307.jpg]
   (f)   Site Landscaping.  In addition to the other landscaping required in
this Chapter, 1 tree shall be planted per 3,000 square feet of lot area.
   (g)   Screening of Mechanical Equipment. Mechanical equipment such as
transformers and HVAC shall not be located in front yards. All mechanical
equipment, including both ground-mounted and roof-mounted equipment, shall be
screened from view from adjacent public and private rights-of-way, as well as
from all property zoned or used for residential purposes, through the use of
evergreen plantings or enclosures.
   (h)   Screening of Trash Receptacles. Trash receptacles shall be located in
side or rear yards and screened on three (3) sides with durable building
materials consistent in appearance and materials with that of the principal
building. The fourth side shall be screened with an opaque gate with a lockable
latch assembly.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1280.05  PLANTING STANDARDS.
   (a)   The plant palette should emphasize native trees, shrubs, ground cover
which is hardy to this region. The City shall keep and revise a list of
preferred and prohibited species.
   (b)   Shade trees shall have a DBH (diameter at breast height) of at least
2.5 inches; Ornamental trees shall have DBH of at least 2 inches and evergreen
trees shall be at least 6 feet high at the time of planting. Deciduous and
evergreen shrubs shall be a minimum of 18 inches high at the time of planting
with no fewer than 6 main branches.
   (c)   Plants shall be salt-spray tolerant, compatible with existing soil
conditions and tolerant of a wide range of conditions.
   (d)   The planting design shall use massing or groupings of materials to
create a stronger visual impact for high speed areas, use plant diversity for
long term health of the plants, use repetition for continuity and create visual
interest by incorporating spring and summer flowers and fall color. The design
shall incorporate the Planning Commission's desired visual effect and, equally
important, the intent of the City to coordinate landscaping on adjoining
properties.
   (e)   New landscaping should be naturalistic looking by being sensitive to
area's existing natural features. New landscaping should blend with existing

additional tree plantings or other landscape elements where existing or
proposed vegetation is sparse and/or the intent of these regulations is not
met.

constitute a lien upon such lands from the date of the entry and shall be
collected as other taxes and returned to the City's General Fund.
   (c)   Notice to the owner or lessee shall not be required prior to the
removal of a hazardous sign which, in the joint opinion of the City Manager and

hardship on the property owner or occupant due to the unique location or
physical characteristics of the property, if such variance would not adversely
affect the public interest in any substantial manner, and if the relevant
physical characteristics of the property were not caused by a current or
previous owner or occupant. Intentional acts by an owner or occupant officially
approved by the City of Springboro shall not act as a bar to the determination
of a hardship.
   (b)   The City Planning Commission shall have authority to approve variances
from the provisions of this chapter as part of its comprehensive review and

submitted by the developer prior to final approval of the planned unit
development. In such cases, the Planning Commission shall endeavor to maintain
consistency with this chapter to the maximum extent feasible.

or request for a variance, no subsequent application requesting the same

set forth in

Manager/designee pursuant to this chapter.

applicant for a sign permit or person directly and adversely affected by the
issuance of such permit files an appeal disputing the interpretation of the
City Manager or designee, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear relevant
arguments on the question, and shall render a decision. The following
principles shall be applied when making interpretations:
   (a)   This chapter is generally written in permissive language. Signs not
specifically and expressly identified, defined and permitted by this chapter
are prohibited.
   (b)   A sign will fall under at least one functional classification and at
least one structural classification under the definitions of this chapter. Each
sign must satisfy the regulations for all such classifications.
   (c)   Where two regulations are in conflict, the more specific shall
prevail. Where neither regulation is more specific, the more restrictive shall
prevail.
   (d)   Ambiguity should be resolved to maximize consistency among the
provisions of the chapter, and effectuate their intent.
   Requests by the City Manager or designee to the Board of Zoning Appeals for
interpretations, and appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals of interpretations
by the City Manager or designee from applicants or persons directly and
adversely affected by the issuance of a permit, shall carry no fee.  (Ord. 0-
15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1281.29  SEVERABILITY.
   Should any part of this chapter be found unenforceable by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall remain in full
force and effect to the extent not in conflict with the court's decision.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1281.30  PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree. A separate offense shall be deemed committed
each day during or on which a violation or noncompliance occurs or continues.
The owner or tenant of any building, structure, premises or part thereof, and
any architect, builder, contractor, agent or other person who commits,
participates in, assists in or maintains such violation, may each be found
guilty of a separate offense and suffer the penalties provided in this section.
Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the City from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation, including
enforcement of the General Offenses Code (Part Six of the Code of Ordinances). 
(Ord. 0-16-4.  Passed 3-3-16.)

   The Planning Commission shall review the site plan and the reports of City
staff at a Work Session not later than 12 days after the site plan submission
deadline (see Figure 10 at the end of this chapter). At the Work Session, the
Planning Commission shall schedule formal review of the site plan at its next
regular meeting to take place at least 16 days after the Work Session if all of
the following requirements are met and/or recommend modifications thereof to
the applicant or landowner if any of the following requirements are not met:
   (a)   The application shall be fully and accurately completed;

operational limitations recommended by the Commission which are reasonably
related to the public health, safety and general welfare and which are
desirable to serve the premises or minimize the adverse effects of the plan on
the neighborhood or community.
   (l)   Walkway/bikeways fronting on public roads shall be designed and
integrated with the screening and landscaping in a manner conforming to the
relevant renderings provided in the City's Bicycle Pedestrian Plan.

screening techniques shall not only relate to the development of the subject
site but also coordinate with the existing and prospective development of
adjacent sites and public facilities.  (Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1284.09  MODIFICATION OF PLAN UNDER REVIEW.
   (a)   Maintenance of Pending Status. In cases where site plan modifications
have been recommended by the Planning Commission, to maintain the pending
status of the application before the Commission, the applicant shall within
90days after receipt of the recommendations or such longer period as may be
granted by the Commission, file a modified site plan incorporating the
recommended modifications or suggested new alternatives (see Figure 10 at the
end of this chapter). Failure to respond to the Commission's initial and
subsequent recommendations in a timely manner as set forth above may result in
denial of the application without further notice.
   (b)   Staff Review. Upon the filing of a modified site plan by an applicant,
the Planning Director shall evaluate the changes made in the modified plan and
shall prepare a report on such plan to be submitted with such plan to the
Planning Commission.
   (c)   Planning Commission Review. The Commission shall review such plan and
the aforesaid report and shall approve or disapprove such plan at the next
regularly scheduled Commission meeting, provided the time limits prescribed in
Section
1284.09  are met. The Commission shall base its evaluation of such plan on the
criteria set forth in Section
1284.08 .
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1284.10  SITE PLANS THAT REQUIRE VARIANCES FROM THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   If a site plan requires approval of a variance from the Board of Zoning
Appeals, the applicant shall confer with City staff before filing the variance
application. If the Board of Zoning Appeals approves the variance(s), the
Planning Commission shall review the site plan at a Work Session pursuant to
Section
1284.08 before the Planning Commission schedules a formal review. The Planning
Commission may review and comment on the site plan prior to the Board of Zoning
Appeals review of the variance application.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1284.11  APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL.
   (a)   Criteria for Approval. At a formal Planning Commission meeting, the
Planning Commission may approve a site plan or modified site plan only upon a
finding that all applicable conditions set forth in Section
1284.08  have been met.
   (b)   Conditional Approval. The Commission may grant approval of a site plan
or modified site plan subject to conditions which it shall specify. Upon
satisfaction of such conditions, as determined by the Zoning Inspector,
approval shall be granted. Such approval shall be endorsed on all copies of the
site plan or modified site plan and one copy shall be returned to the
applicant.
   (c)   Filing of Record Copies. Upon approval by the Commission, a copy of
the finalized site plan and narrative attachments shall be retained by the
City. The Inspector shall endorse such copies indicating final approval. One
copy shall be filed in the Manager's office, one copy shall be retained by the
Inspector and one copy shall be filed with the Planning Director.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1284.12  ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW.
   All structures within a development subject to Site Plan Review under this
chapter shall upon site plan comply with the provisions of Section
1262.04, Section
1264.04, and Section
1264.05, as applicable. Any uses in the Historic District and Central Business
District shall obtain the necessary approval of the Architectural Review Board.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1284.13  CONTROL OF ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS, ETC.; RESTRICTION OF USES.
   An approved site plan shall control the issuance of all building permits,
occupancy permits and other related permits. An approved site plan shall
conclusively restrict the nature, location and design of all uses within the
area described in the approval plan, unaffected by any subsequent change in
ownership or tenancy of the premises. No occupancy permit shall be issued until
an "as-built" drawing accurately showing all improvements has been submitted to
the Planning Director. 
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1284.14  SITE PLAN AS CONDITION OF ZONING CERTIFICATE AND CONTINUATION OF USE.
   The continual compliance with the terms, contents and conditions of any site
plan approved by the Planning Commission is a requirement for issuance of a
zoning certificate, and a violation of any of those terms, contents and
conditions is grounds for revoking such certificate at any time. All subsequent
owners of the land and/or use covered by such site plan shall maintain
compliance with the approved site plan. Failure to maintain compliance may
result in termination of the use by revocation of the zoning certificate.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1284.15  MODIFICATION OF APPROVED SITE PLAN.
   Minor changes to an approved site plan may be approved by a writing endorsed
by the Planning Director if such changes are clearly consistent with the
purposes and character of the approved site plan and are in conformance with
this chapter and with all other Municipal ordinances and laws. Major changes
and changes where consistency with the approved plan is not clear to the
Planning Director are subject to the procedural requirements of this chapter in
the same manner as an entirely new plan. All applications for modifications to
an approved site plan shall be filed with the Planning Director in the same
format as an original site plan filing, to the extent applicable. Minor changes
shall consist of the exempt uses and structures of Section
1284.03 and any changes that, due to unanticipated site constraints, or to
improve safety, protect natural features or comply with unanticipated
requirements of outside agencies.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1284.16  ADMINISTRATIVE RULES AUTHORIZED.
   The Planning Director, with the approval of the City Manager, shall make and
apply such rules and regulations as are reasonably necessary for the
administration and enforcement of this chapter.  (Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-
15.)
1284.17  BURDEN OF PROOF; STANDARD OF PROOF.
   The duty to come forward with evidence demonstrating compliance of a site
plan with all laws and reasonable rules and regulations of the City rests
solely with the applicant. Such evidence shall be sufficient in quality and
quantity to be clear and convincing, unless a different standard of proof is
specifically stated within the regulation at issue.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1284.18  EXPIRATION OF APPROVALS.
   (a)   Site Plan Review approvals shall expire 6 months following approval by
Planning Commission if lawful construction has not begun. No more than one 6-
month extension may be granted by the Planning Commission (see Figure 10 at the
end of this chapter).
   If at the end of that time construction has not begun, then approval of such
site plan shall expire and shall be of no effect unless resubmitted and re-
approved in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Chapter.
Construction is deemed to have begun when all necessary excavation and piers or
footings of one or more principal buildings included in the plan have been
completed.

1285.01  POWERS OF THE BZA REGARDING APPEALS; VOTING REQUIREMENTS.
   In exercising the powers set forth in this Chapter, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may, so long as such action is in conformity with this Zoning Code,
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or modify, an order, requirement, decision
or determination of the Zoning Inspector and to that end shall have the powers
of the Zoning Inspector. The concurring vote of 5 members of the Board is
necessary to appeal and reverse any order, requirement, decision or
determination of the Zoning Inspector as outlined in this Chapter. The
concurring vote of 4 members of the Board is necessary to decide in favor of
the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this Zoning
Code or to effect any variance in the application of this Zoning Code as
outlined in this Chapter.  (Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1285.02  APPEALS.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged that there is error in any order, requirement, decision or
determination made by the Zoning Inspector in the enforcement of this Zoning
Code. Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals concerning the interpretation or
administration of this Zoning Code may be taken by any person aggrieved or by
any officer or bureau of the governing body of the City affected by a decision
of the Zoning Inspector. Such appeals shall be taken within a reasonable time,
not to exceed 60 days or such lesser period as may be provided by the rules of
the Board, by filing with the Zoning Inspector and with the Board a notice of
appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The Zoning Inspector shall forthwith
transmit to the Board all papers constituting the record upon which the action
appealed from was taken. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing
of appeal, give public notice thereof as well as due notice to the parties in
interest in accordance with Section
1285.04, and decide the same within a reasonable time. At the hearing, any
party may appear in person or by an agent or attorney.  (Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed
2-19-15.)
1285.03  STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.
   An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from,
unless the Zoning Inspector, from whom the appeal is taken, certifies to the
Board of Zoning Appeals, after the notice of appeal is filed with him or her,
that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his or her
opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings
shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by
the Board or by a court of record on application, on notice to the Zoning
Inspector from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.  (Ord. 0-15-4. 
Passed 2-19-15.)
1285.04  VARIANCES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby authorized to authorize, upon appeal
in specific cases, a variance from this Zoning Code as will not be contrary to
the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement
of this Zoning Code would result in a practical difficulty. No nonconforming
use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in the same district and no
permitted or nonconforming use of lands, structures or buildings in other
districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance. A
variance from this Zoning Code shall not be granted by the Board unless and
until the following procedure is followed.
   (a)   Application. A written application for a variance.
   (b)   Schedule a Public Hearing. A Public Hearing shall be scheduled within
60 days of filing the application.
   (c)   Notice of Public Hearing. Before holding the Public Hearing, notice of
such hearing shall be given at least 15 calendar days before the date of such
hearing. The owner of the property for which the application is made, or his or
her agent, shall be notified by general mail or personal delivery. Notice of
such hearing shall be posted on the property for which the application is made,
at the Municipal Building, and in other locations required under City Code
Section
224.01, Posting Places, at least 15 days prior to the Public Hearing.
   (d)   Public Hearing. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a Public
Hearing in accordance with state law. Any party may appear in person or by an
agent or attorney.
   (e)   Findings of the Board of Zoning Appeals. The Board shall make findings
that the following requirements have been met by the applicant for a variance:
      (1)   Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to
the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other
lands, structures or buildings in the same district.;
      (2)   A literal interpretation of this Zoning Code would deprive the
applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district
under this Zoning Code;
      (3)   The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant; and
      (4)   Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant
any special privilege that is denied by this Zoning Code to other lands,
structures or buildings in the same district.
         (Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1285.05  SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS FOR VARIANCES; PROHIBITED
USES.
   In granting any variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Zoning Code. A
violation of any of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the
terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this
Zoning Code, punishable under Chapter
1288. Under no circumstances shall the Board grant a variance to allow a use
not permissible under this Zoning Code in the district involved, or any use
expressly or by implication prohibited by this Zoning Code in such district.

1286.01  INTENT.
   Within the districts established by this Zoning Code, as amended, there
exist lots, structures, uses of land and/or structures and characteristics of
use which were lawful before this Zoning Code was passed or amended, but which
are prohibited, regulated or restricted under the provisions of this Zoning
Code, as amended. With regard to most nonconformities, it is the intent of this
chapter to permit them to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage
their survival. It is further the intent of this chapter that most
nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, extended or used as
grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district. However, it is also recognized that certain classes of
nonconformities may present less severe conflicts with permitted uses, and some
relief from these restrictions can be made conditionally available to the
owners of such properties on an elective basis.   (Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-
15.)
1286.02  INCOMPATIBILITY OF NONCONFORMING USES; EXTENSION OR ENLARGEMENT.
   Nonconforming uses are hereby declared to be incompatible with permitted
uses in the district involved. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a
nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land or a
nonconforming use of a structure and land in combination shall not be extended
or enlarged after passage of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 546B, passed February
25, 1976), nor shall other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally
in the district involved be commenced.   (Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1286.03  BUILDINGS UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Zoning Code shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption (Ord. 546B, passed February 25, 1976) or amendment of this Zoning Code
which would prohibit or limit such construction, and upon which actual building
construction has been carried on diligently. As used in this section, "actual
building construction" means and includes the placing of construction materials
in a permanent position, fastened in a permanent manner. In the case of
excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building, such excavation,
demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction if the work is
carried on diligently.  (Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1286.04  NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-
family dwelling and any customary accessory buildings may be erected on any
single lot which is of record on the effective date of adoption or amendment of
this Zoning Code (Ordinance 546B, passed February 25, 1976), notwithstanding
limitations imposed by other provisions of this Zoning Code. Such lot must be
in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the
same ownership. This section shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the
requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the
district, provided that yard dimensions or requirements, other than those
applying to area or width, or both, of the lot, shall conform to the
regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard
requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1286.05  NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD IN COMBINATION.
   If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of adoption
of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 546B, passed February 25, 1976), and if part or
all of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and
area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the
purposes of this Zoning Code and no portion of such lot or parcel shall be used
or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with the lot width and area
requirements established by this Zoning Code, nor shall any division of any
parcel be made which creates a lot with a width or area below the requirements
stated in this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1286.06  NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   Where, at the time of the adoption of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 546B,
passed February 25, 1976), a lawful use of land exists which is not permitted
by this Zoning Code, and where such use involves no individual structure with a
replacement cost exceeding $1,000, the use may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful provided that:
   (a)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased or extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied on the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 546B, passed February 25,
1976).
   (b)   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use on the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 546B,
passed February 25, 1976).
   (c)   If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for more
than 6 months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations
of this Zoning Code for the district in which such land is located.
   (d)   No additional structure not conforming to this Zoning Code shall be
erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
      (Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1286.07  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists on the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 546B, passed February 25, 1976) that
cannot be built under the provisions of this Zoning Code by reason of
restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot or
other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   No such nonconforming structure shall be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity.
   (b)   Should such nonconforming structure or a nonconforming portion of such
structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its
replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed
except in conformity with this Zoning Code.
   (c)   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance, it
shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is
located after it is moved. (Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1286.08  NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND LAND IN
COMBINATION.
   If a lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost of
$1,000 or more, or of a structure and land in combination, exists on the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 546B,
passed February 25, 1976), that is not allowed in the district under the
provisions of this Zoning Code, the lawful use may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Zoning
Code in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except to change the
use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
   (b)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of a
building which was manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 546B, passed February 25,
1976), but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such
building.
   (c)   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or of a structure and land in combination, may, as a special
exception, be changed to another nonconforming use, provided that the Board of
Zoning Appeals, either by general rule or by making findings in the specific
case, finds that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to
the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change,
the Board may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with
this Zoning Code.
   (d)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district in which it is located, and the nonconforming
use may not thereafter be resumed.
   (e)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or of a structure and land in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for 6 consecutive months or for 18
months during any 3-year period (not including any period when government
action substantially impedes physical access to the premises), the structure,
or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except
in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (f)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land. As used in this subsection, "destruction"
means damage to an extent of more than 50 percent of the replacement cost at
the time of destruction.
   (g)   When a nonconforming structure is damaged to an extent of more than 50
percent of the replacement cost at the time of destruction, it may not be
rebuilt except in conformity to the regulations of the district in which it is
located.
   (h)   When a nonconforming use is discontinued as a result of damage to the
structure in which it is located to an extent of more than 50 percent of the
replacement cost at the time of destruction, it may not be restarted.
      (Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1286.09  REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on
ordinary repairs, or on the repair or replacement of nonbearing walls,
fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding 10 percent of the
current replacement cost of the nonconforming structure or nonconforming
portion of the structure, as the case may be, provided that the cubic content
existing when it becomes nonconforming shall not be increased. If a
nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming
use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and
maintenance, and it is declared by a duly authorized official to be unsafe or
unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored,
repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district
in which it is located. Nothing in this Zoning Code shall be deemed to prevent
the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part
thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the
public safety, upon order of such official.  (Ord. 0-15-4.  Passed 2-19-15.)
1286.10  LIMITED RELIEF FROM RESTRICTIONS AVAILABLE TO NONCONFORMING BUSINESS
OR INDUSTRIAL USES OR STRUCTURES IN BUSINESS OR INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS.
   Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, when a nonconforming
multi-family residential, business or industrial use or structure is located in
a zoning district which permits business or industrial uses (other than
agriculture, horticulture or home occupations), the owner of the property may
elect to exercise the following options, subject to the stated conditions:
   (a)   To expand the use or structure on the existing lot provided that the
lot is conforming in all respects to the most restrictive dimensional
requirements which would be in effect if the lot were zoned to permit the use;
and further provided that all yard, area and other dimensional and functional
requirements in effect for the actual district designation (e.g., lighting,
parking) are satisfied.
   (b)   To rebuild the structure within 12 months after a casualty loss, even
if the loss is as great as 100 percent.
   (c)   To restart the use on the existing lot, provided it has been
discontinued or abandoned for no more than 12 consecutive months or for no more
than 18 months during any 3-year period. Any period when government action
substantially impedes physical access to the premises shall not be considered a
discontinuance or abandonment.
   (d)   To remove and rebuild the structure(s) in the same or different form
or location on the existing lot provided that the lot is conforming in all
respects to the most restrictive dimensional requirements which would be in
effect if the lot were zoned to permit the use; and further provided that all
yard, area and other dimensional and functional requirements in effect for the
actual district designation (e.g., lighting, parking) are satisfied.
   If the proposed expansion or reconstruction of a nonconforming business use
or structure is of such a nature that it may be permitted only by exercise of
the elective rights provided by this Section

   (a)   Whenever the public necessity, convenience, general welfare or good
zoning practice requires it, Council may, by ordinance, after receipt of a
recommendation thereon from the Planning Commission and subject to the
procedures provided by law, amend, supplement, change or repeal the
regulations, restrictions and boundaries or classification of property set
forth in this Zoning Code. It shall be the duty of the Commission to submit its
recommendations regarding all applications or proposals for amendments to
Council.
   (b)   There is hereby adopted in and for the City a sensible "good neighbor"
policy, whereby notification of proceedings concerning Municipal land use
planning and rezoning shall be given to all property owners who own properties
located within the immediate neighborhood, being located within 300 feet of the
subject property, regardless of what jurisdiction these neighboring properties
are located within, and also to any local governmental jurisdiction whose

notifications shall be mailed to the respective owners and jurisdictions which
so qualify, so that their comments and concerns can be considered in land use
and zoning decisions which concern property located within such close proximity
to such other jurisdictions. It is hoped that this policy of cooperation will
also be adopted by all of the City's neighboring jurisdictions so as to help
create a more cooperative environment within which better, more coordinated
land use decisions can be made.

(Ord. 649. Passed 6-16-77.)
1444.02  RIGHT OF ENTRY OF BUILDING AND ZONING INSPECTOR.
   The Building and Zoning Inspector shall have free access to any building,
dwelling or structure in the Municipality at any reasonable hour, upon showing
appropriate identification, for the purpose of making an inspection,
examination or survey of such building, dwelling or structure, where he or she
has reason to believe that such building, dwelling or structure is unsafe or
insecure and thereby dangerous to the residents of the Municipality.
(Ord. 649. Passed 6-16-77.)
1444.03  NOTICES TO REPAIR; CONFORMITY WITH BUILDING AND HOUSING AND ZONING
CODES REQUIRED.
   Upon a determination by the Building and Zoning Inspector that any building,
dwelling or structure is in an advanced state of disrepair by reason of
defective or inadequate plumbing or sanitary facilities; faulty or defective
electric wiring; the accumulation of debris, filth, rubbish or garbage; general
deterioration in the structure due to age, neglect, exposure to the elements or
vandalism; failure of the exterior enclosure causing exposure to the elements
and a general deterioration of the structure; partial damage to the structure
due to fire, windstorm or other calamity; or deterioration or damage to the
foundation, so as to endanger the health, safety and welfare of the public and
is therefore a public nuisance, the Inspector shall direct the owner of such
building, dwelling or structure, in writing, by certified mail, at the last
known address of such owner, to effect the repairs necessary to put the
building in a reasonably safe condition. If the owner is unknown or cannot be
located, the Inspector shall publish such notice in a newspaper of general
circulation in the Municipality for not less than two consecutive weeks. No
repairs shall be made unless all requirements of this Building and Housing Code
and the Zoning Code are complied with.
(Ord. 649. Passed 6-16-77.)

writing, to Council, the finding by the Building and Zoning Inspector that such
building, dwelling or structure is in such an advanced state of disrepair as to
endanger the health, safety and welfare of the public.
   (b)    Upon receipt of the written appeal, Council shall set the matter down
for hearing within thirty days after receiving notice of appeal and the owner
shall have an opportunity to appear before Council and to present evidence that
the building, dwelling or structure is not in such an advanced state of
disrepair, for any of the reasons set forth in Section
1444.03, as to endanger the health, safety and welfare of the public and,
therefore, is not a public nuisance.
   (c)    If no appeal is filed from the finding of the Inspector within such
sixty-day period, or if Council affirms the finding of the Inspector and
determines that the building, dwelling or structure involved is a public
nuisance, Council shall order the Clerk of Council to advertise for bids for
the demolition and removal of the building, dwelling or structure in accordance
with law, unless the owner has repaired the same in accordance with
requirements of this Building and Housing Code.
   (d)    If Council is apprised that the owner has appealed its decision to
the Common Pleas Court or any other court having jurisdiction of such an
appeal, the matter will be held in abeyance until further order of the court.

to this chapter shall be paid by the owner of the premises upon which any such
building, dwelling or structure is situated, within ninety days after the
demolition or removal thereof, as provided in this chapter, and if not paid

1448.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of Springboro, State of Ohio, does ordain as
follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The City of Springboro has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)    Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall
apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City
of Springboro as identified in Section
1448.01 (f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
City of Springboro.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Warren County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Warren County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective December 17, 2010.
      (2)   Other studies and / or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Springboro as required by Section
1448.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and / or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Municipal Building at 320 West Central Avenue,
Springboro, Ohio 45066.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Springboro, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)    Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations
be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision
shall not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part
thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
(Ord. 10-37.  Passed 11-4-10.)
1448.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure.  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal.  A request for review of the floodplain administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a

chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE).  The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement.  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development.  Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,

storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor.  See “Lowest Floor.”
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill.  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   FloodorFlooding.  A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
        (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM).  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).  An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones.  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the
500- year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS).  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation.    The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus one and a half feet (1.5) of freeboard. In
areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the
flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway. 
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard.,  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure.  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC).  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor.  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home.  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park.  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27- 01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction.  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Springboro
Flood Insurance Rate Map, February 4, 1981, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person.  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
“Agency” does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general’s department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle.  A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect.  A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer.  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor.  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area.  Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction.  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure.  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement.  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction,”
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance.  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation.  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.  (Ord. 10-37.  Passed 11-4-10.)
1448.03  ADMINISTRATION.

   (e)   Review and Approval of a Floodplain Development Permit Application. 
      (1)   Review.
         A.   After receipt of a complete application, the Floodplain
Administrator shall review the application to ensure that the standards of
these regulations have been met. No floodplain development permit application
shall be reviewed until all information required in Section
1448.03(d) has been received by the Floodplain Administrator.
         B.   The Floodplain Administrator shall review all floodplain
development permit applications to assure that all necessary permits have been
received from those federal, state or local governmental agencies from which
prior approval is required. The applicant shall be responsible for obtaining
such permits as required including permits issued by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act and Section 404 of the
Clean Water Act, and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency under Section 401
of the Clean Water Act.
      (2)   Approval.  Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of a complete
application, the Flood Plain Administrator shall either approve or disapprove
the application. If an application is approved, a Flood Plain Development
Permit shall be issued. All Flood Plain Development Permits shall be
conditioned upon (i) the applicant having received all permits and approvals
required by the City necessary to be able to develop the property in question,
and; (ii) the commencement of work within one year from the date the applicant
has received all necessary permits and approvals, including the Flood Plain
Development Permit necessary to be able to develop the property in question.  A
Flood Plain Development Permit shall expire one (1) year after issuance of all
necessary permits and approvals required by the City in order for the applicant
to develop the property in question, unless the permitted activity has
substantially begun and is being pursued to completion.
   (f)   Inspections.  The Floodplain Administrator shall make periodic
inspections at appropriate times throughout the period of construction in order
to monitor compliance with permit conditions.
   (g)   Post-Construction Certifications Required.  The following as-built
certifications are required after a floodplain development permit has been
issued:
      (1)   For new or substantially improved residential structures, or
nonresidential structures that have been elevated, the applicant shall have a
Federal Emergency Management Agency Elevation Certificate completed by a
registered surveyor to record as-built elevation data. For elevated structures
in Zone A and Zone AO areas without a base flood elevation, the elevation
certificate may be completed by the property owner or owner’s representative.
      (2)   For all development activities subject to the standards of Section
1448.03(j)(1), a Letter of Map Revision.
   (h)   Revoking a Floodplain Development Permit.  A floodplain development
permit shall be revocable, if among other things, the actual development
activity does not conform to the terms of the application and permit granted
thereon.  In the event of the revocation of a permit, an appeal may be taken to
the Appeals Board in accordance with Section
1448.05  of these regulations.
   (i)   Exemption from Filing a Development Permit.  An application for a

   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities.  To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that City of Springboro flood maps, studies and other data identified in
Section
1448.01 (f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1448.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1448.03(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1448.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of City of
Springboro, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation / Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Springboro have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Springboro Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
Springboro boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
City of Springboro suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the City of Springboro has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1448.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity.  Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1448.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of City of Springboro and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point.  Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1448.04(i)(1)B, items 1 and 3-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
“bankfull stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Springboro specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1448.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 10-37.  Passed 11-4-10.)
1448.05  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The City of Springboro Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby appointed
to serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by City
Code.
      (2)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in City Hall
at 320 West Central Avenue, Springboro, Ohio 45066.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.

1448.05(d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals. 
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within twenty days of the date of such notice and order, or other
official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the
mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator’s
decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be
filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the
Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent
information on which the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made to the
Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City of
Springboro.
      (2)   Public Hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B,   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1448.05(d)(2)A to K have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Warren County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.  (Ord. 10-37.  Passed 11-4-
10.)
