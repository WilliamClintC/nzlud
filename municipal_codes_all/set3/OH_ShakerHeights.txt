EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, chapters, articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification.  Each section is self-identifying as to code,
article and section number.  For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section number is .06.  The code and article numbers appear left of the
decimal, with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the
decimal, and the article number being all digits left of the decimal.  The
section number appears right of the decimal.  As another example, 113.10
indicates the code number is 1, the article number is 113 (or the 13th article
within code 1), and the section number is.10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99.  Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections.  For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories indicate
that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance which enacted the individual code unit.
 
   Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably related to
material contained within a given chapter.

be, that the money required for such contract, agreement, obligation or
expenditure is in the treasury to the credit of the fund from which it is to be
drawn and not appropriated for any other purpose.  The provisions of this
section shall not be construed to prevent the making of contracts for a period
extending beyond a single fiscal year when such contracts are otherwise
authorized by this Charter or by general law.  All moneys actually in the
treasury to the credit of the fund from which they are to be drawn, and all
moneys applicable to the payment of the obligation or appropriation involved,

by legislative definition or otherwise, shall be construed accordingly.
(ORC 1.42)
   (b)   Singular and Plural; Gender; Tense.  As used in the Codified
Ordinances, unless the context otherwise requires:
      (1)   The singular includes the plural, and the plural includes the

         B.   "Year" means twelve (12) consecutive months.
            (ORC 1.44)
      (2)   If a number of months is to be computed by counting the months from
a particular day, the period ends on the same numerical day in the concluding
month as the day of the month from which the computation is begun, unless there
are not that many days in the concluding month, in which case the period ends
on the last day of that month.
         (ORC 1.45)
      (3)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be
computed by excluding the first and including the last day, except that when
the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on
the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.  When a
public office, in which an act required by law is to be performed, is closed to
the public for the entire day which constitutes the last day for doing such act
or before its usual closing time on such day, then such act may be performed on
the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.  If any legal
holiday falls on Sunday, the next succeeding day is a legal holiday.
         (ORC 1.14)
      (4)   When legislation is to take effect or become operative from and
after a day named, no part of that day shall be included.
         (ORC 1.15)
      (5)   In all cases where the law shall require any act to be done in a
reasonable time or reasonable notice to be given, such reasonable time or
notice shall mean such time only as may be necessary for the prompt performance
of such duty or compliance with such notice.

three or more municipal officers or other persons shall be construed as giving
such authority to a majority of such officers or other persons, unless it shall
be otherwise expressly declared in the law giving the authority or inconsistent
with State statute or Charter provisions.
   (f)   Exceptions.  The rules of construction shall not apply to any law
which shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when
the subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.09 MASTER COPY.
   The Clerk of Council shall keep one complete master copy in book form and,
in connection therewith or attached thereto in such form and manner as he may
determine to be most easily available for ready reference, one copy of all
amendments and supplements bearing such code, title, chapter or section
designation as may be proper.  If in doubt as to such designation, the Clerk of
Council shall be guided by the advice of the Law Director.
(Ord. 6605.  Enacted 6-24-57.)
101.10 PUBLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION.
   Upon publication of the Codified Ordinances, the Clerk of Council shall
deliver one (1) complete Code to the Mayor, one (1) to the Clerk of Shaker
Heights Municipal Court, one (1) to each member of Council, one (1) to the head
of each department and division of the City, and a complete copy of such
component codes to the employees in each department or division as may be
requested by the director or head thereof.  He shall sell the complete code and
the codes separately, at such prices as Council from time to time may fix.  The
Clerk of Council shall have authority to exchange copies of the Codified
Ordinances with other cities and may, in his discretion, deliver copies to
libraries.  The Clerk of Council shall prepare and distribute, periodically,
the amendments and supplements of the Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 60-118.  Enacted 7-11-60.)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (a)   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the City,
any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful, or an offense, or
a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the failure to
do any act is declared to be unlawful, the violation of any such provision
shall constitute a misdemeanor of the first degree unless otherwise
specifically indicated, and penalized as set forth in subsection (b) hereof.
   (b)   Whoever is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor shall be
imprisoned for a definite term or fined, or both, which term of imprisonment
and fine shall be fixed by the court as provided in this section:

First degree                            $5000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified 2000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this
subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the
penalty provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense, either in
addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this subsection (c).

CHAPTER 103
Official Standards
         EDITOR'S NOTE:  The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings
Time from 2:00 a.m. on the last Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last
Sunday in October.  Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act
requiring uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time
starting in 1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state
from Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each
with a different time standard.  The Ohio legislature through inaction has
elected to observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.

104.01 OHIO DESIGN PROFESSIONAL SELECTION LAW WAIVED.
   The City shall be exempt from the provisions of Ohio R.C. 153.65 through
153.71, which are waived and inapplicable. 
(Ord. 01-43.  Enacted 4-30-01.)
104.02 PROCEDURES.
   Notwithstanding the provisions of Ohio R.C. 9.33, 9.331, 9.332 and 153.65
through 153.71, inclusive, and any other provisions of the Ohio Revised Code
which may conflict with or are inconsistent with the provisions of this
section, the following provisions shall govern the selection and the retention
of professional design firms and construction managers by the City of Shaker
Heights, Ohio:
   (a)   All contracts for professional design firms and construction managers
in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) or more shall be
awarded on the basis of qualifications of the potential contractor and price,
as determined by the Purchasing Committee (the Mayor, Finance Director and
director of the department involved).  Prospective contractors shall submit
proposals in accordance with the instructions and specifications of the City. 
These proposals shall include the price.  The City may reject any and all
proposals.  The Mayor, or the Mayor’s designee, shall recommend to the
Purchasing Committee the best bid proposal, based on the qualifications and
experience of the contractor, price, and other relevant factors.  These
procedures are not intended to be formal bidding requirements, but rather an
informal procedure to determine the best contractor to whom a contract should
be awarded.
   (b)   In addition to complying with the above and other existing City
ordinances and Charter provisions governing contracts and purchases generally,
the Council is authorized to established such further procedures as are deemed
to be in the City’s best interests for the selection of such design

107.01PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to set forth standards for the declaration of
a property or condition as a public nuisance, to declare vacant properties as
nuisances, to authorize the abatement of nuisances by the City and to establish
the procedures for the abatement of nuisances, in order to prevent hazards to
the health, safety and welfare of the public, to prevent blight in residential
and other areas, and to prevent conditions which impair or adversely affect the
value of neighboring properties.
(Ord. 05-52.  Enacted 5-23-05.)
107.02AUTHORITY TO INSPECT PROPERTIES WHERE NUISANCES EXIST AND TO ABATE
NUISANCE CONDITIONS.
   Whenever there shall be done or exist on any property an act, thing, or
condition of a kind which has been or may hereafter be defined by ordinance,
including a Codified Ordinance, as a nuisance, the Director of Public Works, or
the Director of Building and Housing, or their designees, (hereinafter
collectively and individually referred to as "Director"), are authorized and
directed promptly to enter and inspect the premises or structure where such
nuisance is found to exist to determine the extent and nature of the nuisance
and whether it has been abated, provided permission to enter or inspect is
obtained from the owner or his or her agent. If such permission is refused or
is otherwise unobtainable, a search warrant shall be obtained before such entry
or inspection is made, except in the case of an existing emergency in which
case entry or inspection may be made at any time and no search warrant is
necessary. No person shall refuse to permit such emergency entry or inspection,
nor shall any person hinder, obstruct, resist or abuse any person making or
attempting to make such inspection.
(Ord. 17-92. Enacted 11-13-17.)
107.03DECLARATION OF PUBLIC NUISANCE, ORDER AND AUTHORITY TO ABATE.
   (a)   If the Director finds that a nuisance condition exists as defined in
the City's Codified Ordinances, or otherwise by ordinance passed by Council, on
any property, the Director may issue a notice declaring the existence of such
nuisance, and may order the abatement of the nuisance or proceed to abate the
nuisance.
 
   (b)   In addition to the authority granted in subsection (a) of this
Section, if a Director finds that a property or a structure, by reason of
deterioration of materials, lack of repair or maintenance, is or will become a
hazard to the health, safety or welfare of its occupants or the public or is or
will become a blighting or deteriorating factor in the neighborhood, or will
impair or adversely affect the value of neighboring property, the Director may
declare such property or structure to be a nuisance, issue a notice declaring
the existence of such nuisance, and order the abatement of the nuisance or
proceed to abate the nuisance.
 
   (c)    An occupied dwelling structure, which is determined by the Director
to be in violation of Section
1411.29 of the Housing Code, is hereby declared to be a public nuisance.
 
   (d)   The existence of grass, weeds or other landscaping conditions that
violate the provisions of the Housing Code shall be considered a nuisance. If a
warning notice is sent to a property owner, as provided in this Chapter, in any
calendar year, either before or after such a nuisance is found to exist on a
property, the Director may cause any such nuisance found during that calendar
year to be abated or removed by the City as conditions may require, without
further notice or warning.
 
   (e)    The existence of roots of trees that obstruct sewers shall be
considered a nuisance, and if such condition is found, the Director may abate
the nuisance immediately and without service of notice or estimate of the cost
of the abatement.
 
   (f)   If the Director determines to take action to abate the nuisances
described in subsections (d) or (e) of this Section, the Director shall furnish
the owner of the real estate from which the nuisance originates with a
statement of the estimated cost of abating the same prior to the abatement, and
a statement of the final cost as soon as the cost can be ascertained, and shall
order the owner to pay the cost within such reasonable time as the Director
shall fix. The Director shall collect such costs as set forth in this Chapter.
The City may assess the real estate at any time after the City incurs the costs
of preparing to abate and/or abating the nuisance.
(Ord. 10-96. Enacted 8-23-10.)
107.04NOTICE AND SERVICE.
   (a)    A written notice of a nuisance or order to abate shall be served on
the owner, agent, lessee, or party in control of the property. The notice or
order shall set forth the nature of the nuisance, a reasonable time determined
by the Director within which the person shall abate the nuisance, and the
statement that unless the nuisance is abated within the stated time the City
may prosecute the owner, agent, lessee or party in control for failure to
comply with the order of the Director, or may seek an order of a court
requiring the abatement of the nuisance by such person.
   (b)   In addition to or in lieu of the procedure in subsection (a) of this
Section, the Director may cause a written notice and order to be served on the
owner or the agent of the owner of the property setting forth the nature of the
nuisance, the estimate of the cost of abating the same if done by the City, a
reasonable time determined by the Director within which the owner shall abate
the nuisance or pay the estimated cost to the City, and the statement that
unless the nuisance is abated within the stated time it may be abated by the
City and the cost of abatement assessed on the real estate involved.
   (c)    A notice or order shall be served by delivering it personally,
leaving it at the person’s usual place of business or residence, by posting it
in a conspicuous place on the real estate involved, or by mailing it to the
person, or notice may be published in a newspaper of general circulation within
the City if it cannot be served in any of the other ways above mentioned.
(Ord. 05-52.  Enacted 5-23-05.)
107.05ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE; COLLECTION OF COSTS; ASSESSMENT.
   (a)    If the nuisance is not abated within the required time, the Director
may cause its abatement. The abatement of a nuisance may be conducted utilizing
labor and materials provided by the Public Works Department, other departments
of the City, or by entering into a contract for the provision of abatement
services in accordance with the ordinances and Charter of the City.
   (b)   The City may take such action as it deems necessary to collect the
costs incurred by the City in preparing to abate and/or in abating the
nuisance, including the assessment of such costs on the real estate on which
the nuisance existed or the cause or source thereof was located.
   (c)    Regardless of the estimated cost of abating a public nuisance by the
City as determined herein, the owner or agent shall be responsible for payment
to the City of the actual costs incurred by the City in preparing to abate the
nuisance if the City does not proceed with the abatement or in preparing to
abate and abating the nuisance, plus the City's actual administrative costs
applied as a percentage of the total cost incurred by the City, as approved
annually by the Director of Finance.  Should the City's actual costs in abating
such nuisance be less than the estimate, and the owner has paid to the City an
amount equal to such estimated amount, then the City shall refund to the owner
the amount of the difference.
(Ord. 08-33.  Passed 4-28-08.)
107.06 ABATEMENT ON CITY PROPERTY.
   When the cause or source of a nuisance exists on property owned by the City
the Director may abate the nuisance at the expense of the City, and no notice
shall be required preliminary to the abatement. 
(Ord. 05-52.  Enacted 5-23-05.)
107.07VACANT AND ABANDONED STRUCTURES.
   (a)   Definitions:
      (1)   “"Vacant":  A structure shall be considered  "vacant" for the
purposes of this Chapter if it has not been occupied for a period of six (6)
consecutive months or more, except a structure shall not be considered vacant
if it is only seasonally not occupied and such period is less than twelve (12)
months. A structure shall be considered "vacant" for the purpose of this
Chapter even if it is being maintained on the exterior, and even if the owner
of the property is actively attempting to sell or rent the property.
      (2)   "Abandoned": An "abandoned" structure is a structure that is not
occupied for any period of time during which the City has not been able to
communicate with or locate an owner or party with the legal authority to be in
control of the property, and after the City has made reasonable attempts to
communicate with or locate the owner or a party in control.
      (3)   "Occupied": The term "occupied" shall mean the presence of a person
or persons either:
         A.   Living in a structure and using some portion of such structure as
a dwelling unit, as defined in the Housing Code of the City, or
         B.   Working in a structure and using some portion of the structure
for the operation of a business.
      (4)   "Property": The term "property" shall mean all portions of the real
estate of a parcel in the City, including lands and structures of every type.
 
   (b)   Any property that contains a structure that is vacant or abandoned
shall be considered a nuisance unless and until the owner, agent, lessee or
party in control of the property shall, at minimum, take all actions required
in this Section. The exterior of a vacant or abandoned structure, including the
property and structure, shall be maintained in compliance with all applicable
ordinances of the City, and the interior shall be maintained in a safe, secure
and preserved manner to prevent and abate any threat to the health or safety of
the public or anyone entering the structure, and to prevent and abate any
threat of fire or health violation, or to its structural or historical
integrity. The structure shall be winterized to prevent the freezing of pipes,
and all points of entry shall be kept locked and secure. Sufficient property
and liability insurance shall be maintained covering the property up to an
amount at least equal to the fair market value of the property. The City shall
provide the insurance carrier, if known, and any lien holder of record for the
property a written notice of the requirements of this Section and that the
property is considered a vacant or abandoned structure. The City may require an
owner or agent of a vacant or abandoned property in violation of this Section
or any other ordinance applicable to the property or structure to provide proof
of insurance, and no owner or agent shall fail to provide such proof when so
ordered.
 
   (c)   The Director may take any action necessary to inspect a vacant or
abandoned property, and to abate a vacant or abandoned property nuisance, as
authorized in this Chapter.  Upon inspection of a vacant or abandoned
structure, the Director may take any action authorized by law to ensure that
the property, including the structure, is maintained according to the
requirements of all applicable ordinances.
 
   (d)   No insurance company doing business in the City shall pay a claim of
any named insured, including any lien holder, for damage to a vacant or
abandoned structure, other than fire damage covered by Section
901.09 of the Codified Ordinances, unless and until the carrier follows the
procedures in this Section. The carrier shall request from the City an
affidavit signed by the Director of Finance that states whether the City has
any unpaid costs or whether any abatement orders have been issued containing an
estimated cost of work associated with the abatement of any existing nuisance
condition, as defined in this Chapter, at the insured property. The City shall
provide an affidavit in response to the request of an insurance carrier within
thirty (30) days of receiving a request. If the affidavit states that the City
has no unpaid costs or outstanding abatement orders, the carrier may pay the
claim. If the affidavit states that there are unpaid costs the insurance
carrier shall pay to the City such costs or the full amount of the claim owed
to the insured, whichever is less. If the affidavit states that there is an
outstanding abatement order, the insurer shall pay into an escrow fund
established for the purpose of this Section the amount of the estimated cost of
abatement or the full amount owed to the insured, whichever is less.  Funds
shall be disbursed from the escrow to the City upon the presentation of an
invoice showing the amount incurred by the City to abate the nuisance. Funds
shall be disbursed to the insured only upon the written authorization of the
Director of Finance, which shall be provided after the City is provided proof
that the nuisance has been abated, or that an amount equal to the amount in
escrow has been expended in the performance of work to abate the nuisance on
the property.
 
   (e)   No person, other than the owner, agent, lessee or other person with
lawful control of or access to a vacant property that is deemed to be a
nuisance pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section or abandoned pursuant to
subsection (a) of this Section, may enter, remain on, or refuse to leave, or
alter or destroy, the grounds or any structure on such property. Any person who
violates such prohibition, shall be deemed to have entered, remained on,
refused to leave, altered or destroyed the property of another without that
person's consent, and without the privilege, authority or permission to do so,
as such terms are used in Chapter
741 of the Codified Ordinances. Any person who violates this subsection may be
ordered by the Police or any authorized person to leave the premises or the
Police may arrest such person for violating this subsection or a provision of
Chapter
741. Any vehicle remaining on the grounds of such a property that is not titled
in the name of the owner or the ownership is unknown, or that is otherwise in
violation of any provision of the Codified Ordinances, shall be deemed to be
parked without the consent, authority or permission of the owner, agent, lessee
or party in control of the property. The prohibitions in this subsection do not
apply to any employee or agent of any governmental entity, including the City,
which has the lawful authority to enter such property, when such person is
acting in their official capacity as an employee or agent.
 
   (f)    Any vacant property that has been deemed to be a nuisance or
abandoned pursuant to this Section shall be considered to be in the custody of
the City, and the City shall be deemed to be the lawful agent of the owner of
the property, solely for the purposes of Chapter
741 of the Codified Ordinances. This subsection confers no authority to or duty
upon the City over a property as an agent or custodian other than to protect
such properties from trespassers or other persons who may enter such properties
without the authority, consent or privilege to do so from the lawful owner,
agent, lessee, or party in control or possession of such properties, and who
may vandalize and damage the grounds or structures thereon leading to further
deterioration and neighborhood blight. This subsection confers no new or
different authority or duty on the City as to the condition, safety or security
of any private property other than the specific authority conferred expressly
herein, and such authority is in addition to, and not in derogation or
substitution of, the authority of the City pursuant to its police powers. This
subsection is not intended to, nor does it, require the City to be or make the
City responsible or liable to any person for the condition, safety or security
of any private property.
 
   (g)    The Director or the Director's designee may file a complaint with the
Police Department or Prosecutor of the City based on any violation of
subsection (e) of this Section or any violation under Chapter
741 of the Codified Ordinances against a property that is in the custody of the
City or for which the City is deemed the agent of the owner pursuant to this
Section. The Police or Prosecutor may take any lawful action including, but not
limited to, the filing of a criminal complaint in Municipal Court against any
person who violates any provision of Chapter
741 of the Codified Ordinances or subsection (e) of this Section.

and pay the fee, as set forth in this Section. A foreclosure filed by a
governmental entity shall be exempt from this registration requirement.

   (a)   In cases in which the Director finds that a nuisance condition exists
which constitutes an emergency involving immediate danger to human life or
health, or an immediate threat of substantial and/or irreparable physical or
economic damage to a structure, the Director may declare such condition a
nuisance and order its immediate abatement, and the Director may take action
necessary to immediately abate the violation constituting a nuisance without
advance notice to the owner. Such action may include entering a property for
the purposes of conducting an inspection, to the extent and in the manner
allowed by law, ordering that the property be immediately vacated, ordering the
cessation of utility service if necessary to protect life, health or property,
and/or abate the violation constituting the nuisance.
 
   (b)   If the Director abates a nuisance pursuant to this Section, notice
shall be provided to the owner within three (3) days after the start of the
abatement work in the same manner as notice is required in this Section for
non-emergency nuisance abatement.

107.10 APPEALS.
   (a)    Whenever an order or notice of violation is issued, or the City takes
any other action pursuant to this Chapter, the person that is the subject of
the order, notice or action may appeal such order, notice or action to the
Board of Appeals within thirty (30) days from the date of the date of the
order, notice or action.
 
   (b)   When a nuisance subject to this Chapter has not been abated within the
time prescribed in the notice, the Director may authorize the immediate
abatement of such nuisance by the City notwithstanding the pendency of an
appeal of such order/notice to the Board of Appeals. If, as a result of such
appeal, the Board overturns the order of the Director, then the owner shall not
be obligated to pay to the City its costs to abate the nuisance.

108.01 LEGISLATIVE FINDING.
   It is hereby found and determined that there exist within the City of Shaker
Heights premises that, by reason of age, obsolescence, dilapidation,
deterioration, or lack of maintenance or repair or the occurrence of criminal
acts which constitute public nuisances at the premises or a combination
thereof, constitute a blight and a nuisance upon the surrounding neighborhood
because such premises are fire hazards, health hazards, places of retreat for
criminal purposes or for the breach of the public peace, substantial and
unreasonable interferences with the reasonable and lawful use and enjoyment of
other premises in the neighborhood, or factors seriously depreciating property
values in the area.  It is further found that programs aimed at specific
elimination of the particular blights or nuisances involved in neighborhoods of
the City of Shaker Heights have sometimes proven inadequate or ineffective,
have sometimes failed to prevent recurrence of the nuisance or blight, and have
sometimes resulted merely in the alteration of the nature or form of the
nuisance or blight that previously existed.  It is further found that it,
therefore, becomes necessary in order to eliminate nuisance and blight and
prevent recurrence of blight on the premises for the City to obtain the title
of the blighted premises and to take direct action to remove the blight or
provide for its removal by others and to make further provisions for future
development, redevelopment or use of the premises in such a way as to prevent
any recurrence of blight or nuisance on the premises.  It is further found and
determined that acquisition of such blighted property by the City in order to
eliminate blight or nuisance and to prevent its recurrence constitutes a public
purpose. 
(Ord. 02-94.  Enacted 7-22-02.)

obsolescence, dilapidation, deterioration, lack of maintenance or repair, or
the occurrence of criminal acts which constitute public nuisances at the
premises or any combination thereof, including the ineffectiveness of the
City’s code enforcement efforts after lawful issuance of citations or violation
notices, constitute fire, health, or public safety hazard constituting a public
nuisance or repeated and serious breaches of the peace, health hazard, public
safety hazard or any combination thereof; an unreasonable interference with the
reasonable and lawful use and enjoyment of other premises within the
neighborhood; or a factor seriously depreciating property values in the
neighborhood.
   (b)   “Neighborhood” shall mean an area of the City comprised of all

108.03 DETERMINATION OF BLIGHTED PREMISES.
   (a)   The Director of Neighborhood Revitalization or the Director of

The premises so listed in the legislation shall be only those blighted
premises, which, in the opinion of the Directors are such that, in order to
eliminate the existing blight and to prevent future blight, acquisition thereof
will be necessary.  The following factors shall be considered in determining
whether acquisition of the premises is necessary to eliminate existing blight
and/or prevent future blight:
      (1)   The owner of the blighted premises cannot or will not eliminate the
blighted condition, and/or prevent recurrence of the blighted condition.
      (2)   The length of time the subject premises has remained in the
blighted condition after receiving the notice of Housing and/or Building Code
violations.
      (3)   Whether the owner, owner's agent, or person in charge of the
subject property has been convicted of Housing Code violations on said premises
and failed to comply with a court order to fix or correct the violation.
      (4)   Whether the City Council has, within the past five (5) years,
declared the property a public nuisance and the owner cannot or will not
eliminate the nuisance.
      (5)   Whether direct action, including, but not limited to, clearing the
premises of the debris, demolition of blighted structures, or effecting repairs
pursuant to nuisance abatement as provided in Chapters
107 and
109 of the Codified Ordinances of Shaker Heights, would prove to be inadequate
and, in the opinion of the Director making the report, that direct action would
likely prove inadequate to eliminate blight or prevent its recurrence.
   (b)   It shall be prima facie evidence that the owner of the blighted
premises is unwilling or unable to eliminate or prevent the recurrence of the
blighted condition of the premises if the blighted premises has been condemned
or the owner has been prosecuted under Chapter
1409 of the Housing Code and after being found guilty has failed to comply with
the court's order to make repairs.
   The owner's unwillingness or inability to eliminate or prevent the
recurrence of the blighted condition of the premises may also be established
through testimony and documentary evidence of the Council hearings on the
legislation. 
(Ord. 17-92. Enacted 11-13-17.)
108.04 PUBLIC HEARING.
   Upon completion of the Neighborhood Revitalization Committee’s review of the
legislation introduced in accordance with Section
108.03 and after the Committee makes its recommendation to City Council, the
Council shall set a date for a public hearing in regard to the existence of
blight on the premises and the necessity for acquisition of the premises by the
City in order to eliminate blight and prevent the recurrence thereof.  Said
hearing shall be held not less than thirty (30) nor more than forty-five (45)
days from the time the legislation is received by the Clerk of Council.  Upon
the fixing of a day for public hearing, the Clerk of Council shall promptly
send notice to the  owner(s) of record of the premises; the occupants thereof,
if any; the person(s) in charge of the premises, if any; and those residents
living within a 300-foot radius of the subject property, setting forth the time
and place of the hearing and apprising them of their right to appear at such
hearing to show cause why the premises should or should not be declared to be
blighted or why the City should not acquire said premises for the purpose of
eliminating blight thereon and preventing the recurrence of blight.  Notice of
such hearing shall be given by:
   (a)   Posting the notice thereon the premises; or
   (b)   Personal service; or
   (c)   Mailing such order or notice to the last known address of the owner or
owners of record of the premises or the person in charge of the premises or the
occupants thereof; or
   (d)   Publishing the notice in a newspaper of general circulation within the
City of Shaker Heights. 
(Ord. 02-94.  Enacted 7-22-02.)
108.05 PROCEDURE.
   (a)   At the public hearing required by Section
108.04, the legislation shall be read and shall constitute prima facie evidence
of blight on the premises and the need for the City to acquire the premises in
order to eliminate blight and prevent recurrence of blight thereon. 
Thereafter, the owner or owners, person in charge, occupant of the premises or
any person having an interest therein may proceed to show cause why the
premises should or should not be declared blighted and why the City should or
should not  acquire said premises for the purposes of eliminating blight or
preventing its recurrence.
   The director or directors requesting the legislation, or their designated
representatives, shall present evidence to City Council of the existence of
blight on the premises and the need to acquire the premises for elimination of
the blight and the prevention of the recurrence of the blight thereon.  At the
public hearing, the Directors of Neighborhood Revitalization and Planning and
Development shall present to City Council recommendations on how to eliminate
the blight and prevent its reoccurrence.  Members of the general public
residing in the neighborhood or who may otherwise have knowledge of the
condition of such premises may address the Council at the public hearing in
regard to the proposed action by the City.  The Council may adjourn the public
hearing, from time to time, and grant continuances in order that further
argument or evidence can be presented in regard to the existence of blight on
the premises or the need for the City to acquire the premises in order to
eliminate blight or prevent the recurrence of blight thereon.
   (b)   Upon completion of the public hearing provided for in Section
108.04, the Council shall recommend approval or disapproval of the
legislation. 
(Ord. 02-94.  Enacted 7-22-02.)
108.06 ACQUISITION AND BLIGHT ELIMINATION BY CITY.
   Upon determination of Council that a premises is blighted and that
acquisition by the City is necessary in order to eliminate the blight and
prevent recurrence of blight upon the premises, the Director of Building and

      (3)   Sale of the blighted premises to a purchaser upon terms providing
for the elimination of the blight and prevention of its recurrence.
      (4)   Sale of the premises after demolition and clearance (if not needed

letter  to be served on the owner of the property declaring that such property
may be declared  a nuisance property if a second or additional nuisance
activities occur at or within 300 feet of the property within any eighteen
month period. The Chief of Police or the Chief's designee, upon finding that
two or more nuisance activities declared in this Chapter have occurred within
any eighteen month period at or within 300 feet of any property, may cause a
written notice and order to be served on the owner of the property declaring
that such property is a nuisance property. The notice and order shall set forth
the nature of the nuisances, the estimated costs to abate any future nuisance,
and state that the owner may avoid being charged the costs of abatement by
taking steps to prevent any further nuisance activity as set forth in this
Section. The notice shall further state that if a third or subsequent nuisance
activity as declared in this Chapter occurs within eighteen months of the dates
of the first two activities, the City may abate the nuisance by responding to
the activities using administrative and law enforcement actions, and the costs
of such abatement shall be assessed on the nuisance property. Notice shall be
served as set forth in Section
107.04 of the Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 16-109.  Enacted 10-24-16.)
109.03ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE AND COLLECTION OF COSTS.
   (a)   If within eighteen months after the first of the two nuisances
referred to in Section
109.02 has occurred, a third nuisance activity as declared in this Chapter
occurs, the City may abate the nuisance by responding to the activity using
administrative and law enforcement actions, and the costs of such abatement
shall be assessed on the nuisance property in the same manner as in Section
107.05 of the Codified Ordinances, and the costs shall be calculated as set
forth in subsection  (b) of this Section. The City shall provide notice to the
owner of the nuisance property of the City’s intent to assess the costs of
abatement against the owner’s property at least thirty (30) days before such
costs are certified to the County for assessment against the property, and such
notice shall contain a description of the nuisance activity that is the basis
for the notice of intent to assess the property, and the cost to abate. Notice
shall be served as set forth in Section
107.04 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (b)   Costs of abatement shall be assessed based upon the hourly wage of the
police officer or officers involved in the abatement of the nuisance activity,
plus 75%, multiplied by the number of hours required to abate the nuisance.
(Ord. 16-109.  Enacted 10-24-16.)
109.04RIGHT OF APPEAL.
   The owner of a nuisance property who receives a notice from the Chief of
Police or the Chief's designee pursuant to this Chapter may appeal such notice
by submitting a written request for reconsideration to the Chief of Police
within thirty (30) days of the date of the notice.  If the Chief of Police
finds that the facts presented do not support the declaration of a nuisance,
the Chief shall rescind the notice. Otherwise the Chief shall deny the request
and advise the appellant in writing of the denial and of the appellant’s right
to file an appeal to the Board of Appeals. The owner may appeal the denial of
the request for reconsideration by submitting a written appeal letter to the
Board of Appeals within thirty (30) days of the date of the Chief’s denial. Any
such appeal shall not stay any actions by the City to abate the first or any
subsequent nuisance activity. In any such appeal, the City must show by a
preponderance of the evidence that each violation stated in the notice being
appealed has occurred, and that the declaration of the property as a nuisance
property or of the intent of the City to assess the property for abatement
costs, whichever is applicable, is justified. The City shall be deemed to have
failed to meet this standard if the owner demonstrates by a preponderance of
evidence that:
   (a)   He or she was not the owner at the time of any of the nuisance
activity that is the basis of the notice; or
   (b)   He or she had knowledge of the nuisance activity, but has promptly and
vigorously taken all actions necessary to abate each nuisance including,
without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Ohio Revised Code
Sections 5321.17 (C) and 5321.04 (A) (9), or
   (c)   He or she had no knowledge of the nuisance activity and could not,
with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance activity; and
upon receipt of the notice of the declaration of the property as a nuisance
property, he or she promptly took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance
including, without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Ohio Revised
Code Sections 5321.17 (C) and 5321.04 (A) (9).
      (Ord. 16-109.  Enacted 10-24-16.)
109.05EFFECT ON CITY AUTHORITY.
   The declaration of a nuisance property, an order to abate a nuisance, or the
assessment of costs by the City on a property, do not affect or limit the
City’s right or authority to bring criminal prosecution or other legal action
against any person for violation of the City’s ordinances.

110.01 AUTHORITY TO LEVY TAX; PURPOSE OF TAX; INTERPRETATIONS.
   (a)    To provide funds for the purposes of general municipal operations,
maintenance, new equipment, extension and enlargement of municipal services and
facilities and capital improvements, the City hereby levies an annual municipal
income tax on income, qualifying wages, commissions and other compensation, and
on net profits as hereinafter provided.
   (b)    The annual tax is levied at a rate of two and one quarter percent
(2.25%) per annum. The tax is levied at a uniform rate on all persons residing
in or earning or receiving income in the City. The tax is levied on income,
qualifying wages, commissions and other compensation, and on net profits as
hereinafter provided in this Chapter and other sections as they may apply.
   (c)    The tax on income and the withholding tax established by this Chapter
are authorized by Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution. The tax is
levied in accordance with, and is intended to be consistent with, the
provisions and limitations of Ohio Revised Code Chapter 718 (ORC 718). 
   (d)    Any term used in this Chapter that is not otherwise defined in this
Chapter has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of
the United States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the
ORC, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
Chapter that is not otherwise defined in this Chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the ORC and the use is not consistent, then the use of the
term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax shall
control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the ORC.
   (e)    The singular shall include the plural, and the masculine shall
include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
(Ord. 15-91.  Enacted 11-30-15.)
110.02 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this Chapter:
       (a)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file
as a C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C
corporation under division (x)(4) of this section, means a C corporation's
federal taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as
determined under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
          (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal 
taxable income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the
intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income.
          (2)    Add an amount equal to five percent (5%) of intangible income
deducted under division (a) (1) of this section, but excluding that portion of
intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition
of property described in Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
          (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
      (4)   A.    Except as provided in division (a)(4)B. of this section, 
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         B.    Division (a)(4)A. of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in Section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income;
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated

section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable year
beginning on or after January 1, 2017. The amount of such net operating loss
shall be deducted from net profit that is reduced by exempt income to the
extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable income to zero, with any remaining
unused portion of the net operating loss carried forward to not more than five
consecutive taxable years following the taxable year in which the loss was
incurred, but in no case for more years than necessary for the deduction to be
fully utilized.
               B.    No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (a)
(8) of this section to offset qualifying wages.
         C.    (i)    For taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019, 2020,  2021,
or 2022, a person may not deduct more than fifty percent (50%) of the amount of
the deduction otherwise allowed by division (a)(8)A. of this section.

         D.    Any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward deduction  that is
available must be utilized before a taxpayer may deduct any amount pursuant to
division (a)(8) of this section.
         E.    Nothing in division (a)(8)C.(i) of this section precludes a
person from carrying forward use with respect to any return filed for a taxable
year beginning after 2018, any amount of net operating loss that was not fully
utilized by operation of division (a)(8)C.(i) of this section. To the extent
that an amount of net operating loss that was not fully utilized in one or more

this section shall apply to the amount carried forward.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned  directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (v)(3)B. of
Section
110.05.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned  directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the

110.05.

made an election described in division (vv)(2) of this section, is not a
publicly traded partnership that has made the election described in division
(x)(4) of this section, and is not an individual, the taxpayer shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C
corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or
accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such
payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of
interest under Section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States
treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed
retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued
to or for health insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for
life insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
Nothing in division (a) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.

of Tax Review pursuant to Section
110.21, and has "ASSESSMENT" written in all capital letters at the top of such
finding.

110.03 IMPOSITION OF TAX. 
   The income tax levied by the City at a rate of two and one quarter percent
(2.25%) per annum is levied on the Municipal Taxable Income of every person
residing in and/or earning and/or receiving income in the City.
 
Individuals.
   (a)     For residents of the City, the income tax levied herein shall be on
all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation
from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including the
resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned
directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident. This
is further detailed in the definition of income (Section
110.02 (p)).
   (b)     For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages,
commissions, and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by
the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the City, including any net profit of the nonresident, but
excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net profit or loss of
only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by the nonresident.
   (c)     For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to "Municipal
Taxable Income" as defined in Section
110.02(u). Exemptions which may apply are specified in Section

                 A.    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a
compensation plan described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue
Code.
                 B.    "Qualifying loss" means the amount of compensation
attributable to a taxpayer's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, less the
receipt of money and property attributable to distributions from the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Full loss is sustained if no
distribution of money and property is made by the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan. The taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable
year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to that nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
               C.    (i)    "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate
for the taxable year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to the City with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
                      (ii)    If different tax rates applied for different
taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those
different tax rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to
the City each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         D.    "Refundable credit" means the amount of the City income tax that
was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
          (2)    If, in addition to the City, a taxpayer has paid tax to other
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal
corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's
proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the
taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
          (3)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the City
for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
          (4)    The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
                 A.    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had
established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
                 B.    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of
the employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified
deferred compensation.
Domicile.
   (e)   (1)   A.    An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the City for
all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in the City on
the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if the Tax
Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in the City
for all or part of the taxable year.
                   B.    An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile
described in division (e)(1)A. of this section if the individual establishes by
a preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
City for all or part of the taxable year.
          (2)    For the purpose of determining whether an individual is
domiciled in the City for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be
considered include, but are not limited to, the following:
                   A.    The individual's domicile in other taxable years;
                   B.    The location at which the individual is registered to

                 D.    The location of real estate for which the individual
claimed a property tax exemption or reduction allowed on the basis of the
individual's residence or domicile;
                   E.    The location and value of abodes owned or leased by
the individual;
                   F.    Declarations, written or oral, made by the individual
regarding the individual's residency;
                   G.    The primary location at which the individual is
employed.
                   H.    The location of educational institutions attended by
the individual's dependents as defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue
Code, to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based
on the residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located.
                   I.    The number of contact periods the individual has with
the City. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one "contact
period" with the City if the individual is away overnight from the individual's
abode located outside of the City and while away overnight from that abode
spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two consecutive days
in the City. 
          (3)     All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules
and Regulations. 
Businesses.
   (f)    This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or

          (1)    Except as otherwise provided in division (f)(2) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the City for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
                 A.    The average original cost of the real property and
tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession in the City during the taxable period to the average original cost
of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer
in the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated. As
used in this paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall include
property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall
be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
                 B.    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the
taxable period to individuals employed in the business or profession for
services performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
110.04(c).
                 C.   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from
sales and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
City to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same
period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
          (2)   A.    If the apportionment factors described in division (f)(1)
of this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the City, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
City may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of
the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one
or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         B.    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
110.12(a).
                 C.    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (f)(2)A. of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
110.12 (a).
                 D.    Nothing in division (f)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a the
Tax Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
          (3)    As used in division (f)(1)B. of this section, "wages,
salaries, and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other
compensation paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following
locations:
         A.    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:

a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            (iii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person
described in (f)(3)A.(ii) of this section, or a related member of such a
vendor, customer, client, or patient.
                 B.    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing,
investigation, inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative,
judicial, or legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that
the compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the
employer or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly
benefits the employer.
                 C.    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines
that the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (f)(3)A. or B. of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
          (4)    For the purposes of division (f)(1)C. of this section,
receipts from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to
a municipal corporation as follows:
         A.   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in the City if,
regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the following
criteria:
            (i)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the City from
a stock of goods located within the City.
            (ii)    The property is delivered within the City from a  location
outside the City, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
            (iii)    The property is shipped from a place within the  City to
purchasers outside the City, provided that the taxpayer is not, through its own
employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the
place where delivery is made.
                 B.    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be
sitused to the City to the extent that such services are performed in the City.
                 C.    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from
the sale of real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
             D.    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents
and royalties from real property located in the City shall be sitused to the
City.
         E.    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the City.
          (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the
rental of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded
entity owned by the individual, shall be subject to the City's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the City or if the individual
taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the City.  The City
shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for the purpose
of calculating net profit sitused under this division to the municipal
corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   A.    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported

applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the City
to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
                B.    An individual who is a resident of the City shall report
the individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for the City. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such a credit is allowed under the City's income tax ordinance.   
      (7)    When calculating the ratios described in division (f)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (f)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

Withholding provisions.
   (a)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the City shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in the City. Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
110.03 or division (b)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
110.03 of this Chapter, of two and one quarter percent (2.25%) per annum. An
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the
tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer
directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or
credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.   
   (b)   (1)    Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the City the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld
or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer,
agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         A.    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be  remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the City in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the City in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded $200. Payment under this paragraph shall be made so that the payment
is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day
of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         B.    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not  required
to make payments under division (b)(1)A. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the 15th day of the month following the end of each calendar
quarter.
             (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is
required to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal
taxes withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal
Revenue Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation,
the payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator
of all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
          (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make
and file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Tax Administrator and the City as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this Chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the City income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   A.    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         B.    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the City the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for
that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer
in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
          (6)     Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to
the City income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
          (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required
to withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
          (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an
employer shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax
Administrator listing:
                 A.   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the City during the preceding calendar year.
                 B.    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such
employee, the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the
preceding calendar year.
         C.    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year.
                 D.    Any other information required for federal income tax
reporting purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form
with respect to such employee.
                 E.    Other information as may be required by the Tax
Administrator.
          (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with
the responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
          (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the City
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
          (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

subject to division (c)(2)A.(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section. For the purposes of this division, the
location at which an employee spends a particular day shall be determined in

section, an employer is not required to withhold the City income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the City if the employee performed such services in the City on 20 or fewer

that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
110.04.
            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the

professional entertainer, or public figure.
                 B.    For the purposes of division (c)(2)A. of this section,
an employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
City only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf
of the employer in the City than in any other municipal corporation on that
day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a
particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the following
activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's principal
place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;

employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform

          (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (c)(2)A. of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
          (4)   A.    Except as provided in division (c)(4)B. of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the City exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer shall
withhold and remit tax to the City for any subsequent days in that calendar
year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal
services performed in the City.
                 B.    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the
City under division (c)(4)A. of this section may elect to withhold tax for the
City for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in the City.
          (5)    If an employer's fixed location is in the City and the
employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
110.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
City, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the City. To determine whether an employer qualifies as
a small employer for a taxable year, the employer will be required to provide
the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for the
preceding taxable year.
          (6)    Divisions (c)(2)A. and (4) of this section shall not apply to

   (a)    An annual City income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every individual taxpayer eighteen (18) years of age or older and any taxpayer
that is not an individual for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is
subject to the tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon. 
          (1)    The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
110.04 when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income subject to the
tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, and no additional tax is due the City.
          (2)     Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for the City
income tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption
from these filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
The written exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from
which retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the City, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
Chapter.
   (b)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (c)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the City, the return or notice required of that individual shall be
completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent, guardian,
conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the person or
property of that individual.
   (d)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

   (e)    Spouses may file a joint return.
   (f)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
            (2)    The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and
with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to
support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who
files the annual return required by this section electronically is not required
to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041; form
1065; form 1120; form 1120-REIT; form 1120F or form 1120S; and with respect to
an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary to
support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return. A
taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
        (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the City to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal
income tax liability. The requirements imposed under this division (f) apply
regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or on a form
prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (g)   (1)    A.   Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of ORC Section 5747.08. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the City. No remittance is required if
the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
         B.     Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the
taxpayer's taxable year.  The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the City.  No remittance is required
if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
          (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the City's income tax
return. The extended due date of the City's income tax return shall be the 15th
day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is not an
extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an
extension of that date.
                 A.    A copy of the federal extension request shall be
included with the filing of the City's income tax return.
                 B.     A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-
month extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit
a written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's the City income tax return. If
the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the City
income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's
requested extension.
          (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of ORC Section 5747.08, a
taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the City's
income tax return. The extended due date of the City's income tax return shall
be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
          (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the City, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
          (5)    To the extent that any provision in this division (g)
conflicts with any provision in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) prevail.
   (h)   (1)    A taxpayer is not required to remit tax with respect to net
profits if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
            (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the City for a
taxable year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this section shall file with the
City an annual net profit return under division (f)(3) of this section.
   (i)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under division (b)(1)A. of Section
110.04 or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (j)    Taxes withheld for the City by an employer, the agent of an employer,
or other payer as described in Section
110.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the City, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the City and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (k)    Each return required by the City to be filed in accordance with this
division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (l)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the City, provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the City
or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter
and the City's Rules and Regulations governing the filing of returns, reports,
or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (m)   (1)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the City's
income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
            (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may
report the amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and
may make remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
          (3)    Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing
employer withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (n)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the City for
both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for
payment of taxes required by the City during the period of the member's or
civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be
filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (o)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. 
          (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to the City before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
          (3)     Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (o)(1)
of this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period. 
   (p)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (n) and (o) of this section.
          (2)   A.    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension
under the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in
which to file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of
time in which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation
in accordance with this Chapter. The length of any extension granted under this
paragraph shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that the
taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this division,
"qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of the
United States or an act of the congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
                 B.    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with
division (p)(2)A. of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (q)    For each taxable year to which division (n), (o), or (p) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (o)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (r)    As used in this section:
          (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group
as defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
          (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
          (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (r)
(1) of this section.
          (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
ORC Section 4927.01.
          (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
ORC Section 5727.01.
   (s)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the City's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (s)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown. 
          (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal
income tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following
the last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (s)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
          (3)    An election made under division (s)(1) or (2) of this section
is binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (t)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated the City income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the City. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated the
City income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated the City
income tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer
requests and receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a
separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (u)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated the City income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States department of treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (v)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (v)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
110.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
          (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated the City income tax
return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
110.02(a) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject
to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated federal taxable income.
          (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated the City income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         A.    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this section, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
          (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         A.    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal  income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the City;
         B.    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the City income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (w)    Corporations filing a consolidated the City income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (r) through (y) of this section
by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to" for "net
profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in this section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in this section.
   (x)    Each corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the City in accordance with this Chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with the City may continue to file consolidated or
combined tax returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
(Ord. 15-91.  Enacted 11-30-15.)
110.06 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (a)    Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the City who is required to
and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this Chapter, may claim a
nonrefundable credit against the tax imposed by this Chapter upon satisfactory
evidence that tax has been paid to another municipality.  Subject to division
(c) of this section, the credit shall not exceed  fifty percent (50%) of the
amount obtained by multiplying the income, qualifying wages, commissions, net
profits or other compensation subject to tax in the other municipality by  the
lower of the tax rate in such other municipality or the tax rate of one percent
(1%). 
   (b)     The City shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the City who works in a joint economic development zone created
under ORC Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created
under ORC Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a
credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (c)     If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (a) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality. 
(Ord. 15-91.  Enacted 11-30-15.)
110.07 ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (a)    As used in this section:
          (1)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer
reasonably estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the City's income
tax for the current taxable year.
          (2)    "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the City for the
taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and
after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from
another taxable year.
   (b)   (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         A.    Taxes withheld for the City from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the City in equal amounts on each payment date unless the
taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in
which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts
were actually withheld.
         B.    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
          (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations
of estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under the Rules and
Regulations prescribed by the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable
year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under the Rules and

          (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before
the date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under
division (g) of Section
110.05 or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
          (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
          (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (c)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the City, including
the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before
the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         B.    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent (45%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         C.    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent (67.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year;

the taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable

the year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was
filed, an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall
be paid with the return in accordance with ORC Section 718.05.
   (d)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
110.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         B.    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         C.    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         D.    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
          (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
          (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
          (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
one hundred percent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the
taxpayer for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately
preceding taxable year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer
filed a return with the City under Section
110.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year.

   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this Chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds

entered on the document.
(Ord. 15-91.  Enacted 11-30-15.)
110.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (a)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
110.18.
   (b)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
          (1)    Overpayments of ten dollars or more;
          (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten
dollars or more.
   (c)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
          (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (c)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
          (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
110.21.
   (d)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (c) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
          (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the
earliest postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed
is not later than the last day for filing the request.
          (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only
postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private
postal meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for
filing the request, and the request is received within seven days of such last
day.
          (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark
date was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of
the postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within
seven days of the last day for making the request.
   (e)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date of the annual
return or ninety (90) days after the completed return is filed, whichever is
later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing
the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable
year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return
on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time
for filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described
in Section
110.18(a)(4). 
(Ord. 15-91.  Enacted 11-30-15.)
110.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited with the City, but should have been
deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City as a refund but
is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (b)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the City is subject to recovery by the City. If the
City's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a refund
of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the City shall allow
a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the City claims is due
with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to
the first municipality with respect to such income or wages. 
   (c)    If the City's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City's tax rate. However, if the City's tax rate is greater than the tax rate
in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is
to be paid to the City, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during
the period of nonpayment.
   (d)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 15-91.  Enacted 11-30-15.)
110.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the City changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
City. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
          (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated
municipal income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate
return to a consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal
income tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before
filing the amended return.
   (b)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         A.    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or
         B.    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
110.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
            (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of
tax that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e. the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (c)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (e) of
Section
110.12 for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the City. A request filed under this division shall claim
refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
110.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (d)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City tax liability, that taxpayer shall
make and file an amended City return showing income subject to the City income
tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax liability. The
taxpayer shall pay any additional the City income tax shown due thereon or make
a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less
than ten dollars. 
(Ord. 15-91.  Enacted 11-30-15.)
110.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
                (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was
filed, whichever is later; or
                (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying
deferral period, if any.
                 B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this
section may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the
employer, agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to
the extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the
time limit described in division (c) of this section.
          (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
                A.    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
110.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
                B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on
which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if
any party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of
Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (b)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (c)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
110.09.
   (d)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
          (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
110.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (e) of Section
110.09.
   (e)    No civil action to recover the City income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
          (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 15-91.  Enacted 11-30-15.)
110.13 AUDITS.
   (a)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (b)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer. A
taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting an
audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (d)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (f)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. 
(Ord. 15-91.  Enacted 11-30-15.)
110.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (a)    As used in this section:
          (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator
has at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address
the Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under ORC Section 5703.056.
          (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under ORC Section 5703.056 is not
able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason
for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the
assessment.
   (b)    Subject to division (c) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under ORC Section 5703.056.
With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (c)   (1)   A.   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under ORC Section
5703.056. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
                B.    Once the Tax Administrator or the Administrator's
designee serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment is directed
the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an appeal with
the Board of Tax Review within 60 days after the receipt of service. The
delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division (c)(1)A. of
this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the
assessment is served.
          (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by
certified mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address,
the Tax Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The
assessment shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and
include the following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served. If the ordinary mail is subsequently
returned because of an undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall
proceed under division (c)(1)A. of this section. A person may challenge the
presumption of delivery and service under this division in accordance with
division (d) of this section.
   (d)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent (20%), as
determined by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
          (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis
described in division (d)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject
to collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator, the Administrator's
designee or other City official with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Board of Tax Review.
   (e)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (f)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (c)(1)B. of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (g)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 15-91.  Enacted 11-30-15.)
110.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (a)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the City that arises pursuant to the City's income tax imposed in accordance
with this Chapter.
   (b)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
          (1)    Compromise a claim;
          (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim
by agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (d)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due. 
(Ord. 15-91.  Enacted 11-30-15.)
110.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (a)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the City as
authorized by this Chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this Chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)    This section does not prohibit the City from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 15-91.  Enacted 11-30-15.)
110.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by City ordinance or state law to be
filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise the
preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement, claim,
or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based
with intent to defraud the City or the Tax Administrator.

          (5)    "Return" includes any tax return, report, reconciliation,

years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         B.    Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to the City on or after January 1, 2016.
            (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed
or payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the
filing or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be
made before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject
to the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016,
of the City to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (c)    Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer

110.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (a)    Nothing in this Chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the ORC:
          (1)   A.    Exercise all powers as provided by law, including, the

which the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is
withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final.
            (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the
manner authorized by law.
            (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the
withholding obligations described in Section

Verification of accuracy of returns and determination of liability.
 
   (b)   (1)    A Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee
thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
            (2)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer,
or other person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is
subject to, the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax
Administrator's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by the City or for the withholding of such tax.
            (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that
the Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income
that was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
            (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.
Identification information.
   (c)   (1)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
            (2)   A.    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for
identifying information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid
identifying information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this
Chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person
to whom the request was directed pursuant to Section
110.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
110.99.
         B.    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (c) of this section
within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such identifying
information, nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
110.18.
         C.    The penalties provided for under divisions (c)(2)A. and B. of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
110.99 for a violation of Section
110.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.
            (Ord. 15-91.  Enacted 11-30-15.)
110.20 REQUEST FOR OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (b)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator in accordance with the Rules and Regulations.
   (c)    A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (d)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.   
   (e)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator binds the Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (f)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal. 
(Ord. 15-91.  Passed 11-30-15.)

members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the City, but such
appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the
City at any time during their term or in the five years immediately preceding
the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the Mayor. This
member may be an employee of the City, but may not be the director of finance
or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
            (2)    The term for members of the Board of Tax Review shall be two

            (3)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the
legislative authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority
vote for malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a
member, the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges
against the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in
person or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days'
notice. The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and
not appealable.
            (4)    A member of the Board of Tax Review who, for any reason,
ceases to meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section
shall resign immediately by operation of law.
            (5)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same
manner as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was
created. Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the
expiration of the term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall
hold office for the remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax
Review shall impair the power and authority of the remaining members to
exercise all the powers of the Board of Tax Review.

Tax Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason,

member shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of
Tax Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall
be subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (b)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (c)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax
Review. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons
why the assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed
within 60 days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax

DETERMINATION OF ALLOCATION OF TAX
111.0701 METHOD OF DETERMINATION.
   In the taxation of income which is subject to City of Shaker Heights Income
Taxes if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or
profession both within and without the boundaries of the City of Shaker
Heights, shall disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profit
is attributable to that part of the business or profession conducted within the
boundaries of the City of Shaker Heights, then only such portion shall be
considered as having a taxable situs in the City of Shaker Heights for the
purposes of municipal income taxation.  The portion of the entire net profits
of a taxpayer to be allocated as having been derived from within the City of
Shaker Heights, in the absence of actual records thereof, shall be determined
as follows:
   Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to be
determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll, and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight, as follows:
   (a)   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal property
owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the City of
Shaker Heights during the taxable period to the average net book value of all
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
      As used in the preceding paragraph, real property includes property
rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be
determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight (8).
   (b)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable period
to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed in the
City of Shaker Heights to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during
the same period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever
their services are performed.
   (c)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the City of Shaker Heights to
gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales
and services, wherever made or performed.
      In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may under uniform regulations be substituted so
as to produce such result.
      (Ord. 66-135.  Enacted 12-27-66.)

City of Shaker Heights regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered
from a stock of goods within the City of Shaker Heights.
   (b)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
City of Shaker Heights regardless of where title passes even though transported
from a point outside the City of Shaker Heights if the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within the City of Shaker Heights and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion.
   (c)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a place

operations of the real estate from which such rentals are derived, whether so

or in part.
 
   (b)   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties
regardless of number and value, aggregates in excess of two hundred fifty

sponsor a public hearing to study the impact on the City, the state and the
nation of political influence by corporate entities in connection with the most
recent and upcoming elections. "Corporate entities" include business
corporations, Political Action Committees, Super PACs, 501(c)(4) groups and
unions. Members of the general public in attendance shall be afforded the
opportunity to speak on these matters for up to five minutes per person. The
public hearing shall be held during an evening or weekend time. The City will
publicize the public hearing on its website and in area media at least two
weeks in advance. The City shall record the hearing and make such recording or
a transcript available to the public by posting such recording or transcript on
the City's website within ten days following the hearing.
   (b)   Within one (1) week following the biennial public hearing, the Clerk
of City Council shall send a letter to the leaders of the Ohio House and
Senate, to the U.S. Congressional Representative who represents the City, and
to both Ohio Senators. The letter shall include a brief summary of the public
hearing and will state that the citizens of the City of Shaker Heights in
November 2016 voted in support of a Citizens' Initiative calling for an
amendment to the U.S. Constitution declaring:
      (1)   Only human beings, not corporations, are legal persons with
Constitutional rights, and
      (2)   Money is not equivalent to speech, and therefore regulating
political contributions and spending does not equate to limiting political
speech.
   (c)   The biennial public hearings will no longer be required if and when a
Constitutional Amendment reflecting the principles set forth in subsection (b)
is ratified by three-quarters (3/4) of the state legislatures.
(Approved by Initiative November 8, 2016)

122.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   Council intends this Chapter as a regulation of the use of alarm systems in
commercial and residential properties within the City.  Council intends to
regulate the high percentage of false alarms received from such alarm systems
which have the effect of unduly overburdening the Police and Fire Departments. 
This overburdening diverts police and fire resources from other legitimate
matters of public safety and concern.
(Ord. 05-138.  Enacted 12-19-05.)
 
122.02 DEFINITIONS.

City that an emergency exists or that the services of the public safety forces
are needed.  "Alarm system" also means any alarm device which automatically
emits an audible, visual, electronic, telephonic or other similar response upon
the occurrence of any hazard or emergency and which alerts persons outside the
building of the existence of such hazard or emergency. "Alarm system", as
defined in this section, shall include, but not be limited to, alarms for
burglary, fire, flood and cold.  "Alarm system" excludes motor vehicle alarms
and personal alarms.
   (b)   "Automatic dialing alarm system" means an alarm system which dials the
telephone number of the Police or Fire Department and uses a pre-taped or pre-
recorded message to alert the City that an emergency exists or that the
services of the public safety forces are needed.
   (c)   "False alarm notification" means an alarm system notification to the
Police Department or the Fire Department when there is no evidence of a
criminal offense or attempted criminal offense.
   (d)   "Police emergency number" means any telephone number designated by the
Chief of Police as a telephone number through which members of the public may
report an emergency or request public assistance.
   (e)   "Provider" means the person who contracts with the user to provide an

requirements of this chapter.
 
   (b)   Automatic Dialing Alarm Systems.
      (1)   No person shall install or operate an automatic dialing alarm
system, except that automatic dialing alarm systems which have been installed
and which comply with the requirements of current law as of the effective date
of this section may continue to operate as long as they continue to comply with
subsections (b)(2) through (b)(7) hereof.
      (2)   The City may subscribe to one (1) or more telephone lines for
burglar alarm, fire alarm or similar purposes. A person may, upon proper
application and compliance with applicable laws, be granted a permit to install
a device or devices which automatically select the designated telephone line
for the purpose of playing a recorded message or to otherwise report an
intrusion or other emergency.
      (3)   No person shall use or cause to be used any telephone device or
telephone attachment that automatically selects any telephone line allocated by
the telephone company to the City or any of its departments or divisions except

the following:
         A.   Length of message - fifteen (15) seconds maximum.
         B.   Message shall not be repeated more than three (3) times for each
dialing;

Balance of message shall be appropriate to the purpose for which the alarm is
installed and shall be subject to approval of the Chief of Police and/or the
Chief of Fire. The entire message shall be intelligible.
      (5)   Each automatic dialing alarm system shall be programmed to first
dial the police station or fire station on the designated line.  The alarm
system shall next dial a number selected by the applicant, such second number
being that at which a person having a key to the building where the alarm is
installed can normally be found.  The alarm system shall next dial a third
number subject to approval by the Chief of Police or the Chief of Fire. No more
than three (3) such dialings may be programmed except under unusual
circumstances and upon approval by the Chief of Police or the Chief of Fire. 
No enforcement agency other than the Shaker Heights Police Department or Fire

fee or payment charged by the telephone company, shall be paid by the
applicant.
      (7)   The fee to be charged by the City under subsection (b)(6) hereof

the next highest dollar; except the minimum charge shall be five dollars
($5.00) per month per subscriber. All fees shall be payable on a calendar-month

other recognized industry standard.  A user or provider may be required to
submit evidence of the reliability and suitability of the alarm system.
      (2)   The sensory mechanism shall be adjusted to suppress false
indications of fire or intrusion, so that the alarm system will not be actuated
by impulses due to transient pressure change in water pipes, short flashes of
light, wind noises such as the rattling or vibrating of doors or windows,
vehicular noise adjacent to the installation, or other false readings.
      (3)   Each alarm system shall be maintained in good repair.
      (4)   Each provider shall furnish to each user current written operating
and maintenance instructions.

directly or through an agent, on a twenty-four (24) hour basis, seven (7) days

designees may, at reasonable times and upon oral notice, enter upon any
premises within the City to inspect the installation and operation of an alarm
system or to post the notices described in subsection (d)(9) hereof.
      (9)   The Chief of Police or the Chief of Fire or their respective
designees may order a user or provider to repair an alarm system and may order
that the alarm system be disconnected until the repair has been completed. An

about the premises.
   (e)   Permit.  A permit for the installation of a local alarm which, when
activated, sounds a horn, bell, buzzer or other type of audible alarm, shall be
required if the sound created by the alarm is audible beyond the premises being
served.  The Chief of Police shall issue a permit for such an alarm, upon the
payment of a fee of twenty dollars ($20.00), provided the intensity of sound
does not exceed sixty-five decibels at any location outside the premises being
served, and such alarm shall have an automatic cut-off device as provided
herein. Each such local alarm shall be equipped with an automatic cut-off
device which deactivates the alarm noise within ten minutes of the first noise
emitted by the alarm.  Water flow alarms shall be exempt from the provisions of
this subsection (e) hereof.  (Ord. 07-64.  Enacted 6-25-07.)

false alarms shall be counted within any ongoing period of twenty-four (24)
months. Police and Fire false alarms shall be counted separately for the
purpose of counting the number of false alarms. The Chiefs of Police and Fire

is final.
   (d)   If the Chief of Police or Fire finds that the facts presented do not
support the issuance of a warning letter or imposition of a fee, the Chief

issued, the permit fee shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00), but the payment
of such double fee shall not relieve any person from fully complying with the
requirements of this Section or any other State law or City ordinance.
      (3)   A fence permit shall be issued only after the City receives a
complete application with all information required by the Director of Building
and Housing on the application form, the full fee is paid, and the City

the City's ordinances and any applicable State law and regulations.

to the permit, at the Director's discretion, that are consistent with the

However, all other provisions of this section shall apply to fences of all
sizes.
 
   (c)   Permit Revocation.  A fence permit may be revoked:
      (1)   If the fence approved by the permit is not fully erected,
constructed, altered or moved, as allowed by the permit, within twelve months
from the date the permit is issued; or
      (2)   If the fence or its installation violates the terms and conditions
of the permit or any ordinances or State law or regulations. The permittee
shall be provided notice in writing and a reasonable time as determined by the
Director of Planning, or said Director's designee, to complete the fence or
correct any violations prior to the revocation of the permit. No person shall
perform any work on installing, altering or moving a fence after the revocation
of the permit.
 
   (d)   Enforcement and Penalty.
      (1)   The erection, construction, alteration or moving, in whole or in
part, of a fence without a permit, or after a permit has been revoked, shall be
a first degree misdemeanor.
      (2)   The City may enforce this section by bringing a prosecution, by
bringing an action in equity for an order to abate a violation or to remove a
fence erected, constructed, altered or moved in violation of this section, or
by taking any other action the City is authorized by law to take to  enforce
its ordinances.
      (3)   The Director of Planning, or said Director's designee, shall have
the authority to issue and revoke permits, to inspect plans for fences, to
inspect fences, to issue an order to bring a fence into conformance with a
permit and/or the ordinances of the City and laws and regulations of the State,

to bring or initiate any action to enforce this section.
      (4)   The Director of Planning, or said Director's designee, may declare
any fence in violation of the City's ordinances a public nuisance, and proceed
to abate said nuisance as permitted under Chapter
107 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessing the cost to the City of any

or Landmark District, and thereupon take the following actions:
      (1)   The Commission shall advise the City Planning Commission of the
proposed designation and secure from the City Planning Commission its
recommendation with respect to the proposed designations, its opinion as to the
effect of the proposed designation upon the surrounding neighborhood, and its

subsection (b)(2) hereof and shall provide a reasonable opportunity for all
interested parties to express their opinions under such rules as the Commission
may adopt for the purpose of governing the proceedings of the hearings.  Each
speaker shall be fully identified as to name, address, and the interests which
he represents.  The Commission shall make a determination with respect to the
proposed designation in writing within fifteen (15) days after the initial
hearing date and shall notify any owner or any person having a legal or
equitable interest in such property, as well as such other interested parties

   No person owning, renting or occupying property which has been designated a
landmark or which is situated in a designated Landmark District shall make any
environmental or building change or rehabilitation in such property without
consent of the Landmark Commission with respect to such building or
environmental change or rehabilitation. The following procedures shall apply to
all alterations, demolitions, removals or constructions of such property in the
City:
   (a)   Any application to the Building Department for a building permit for
an environmental or building change or rehabilitation shall be forwarded to the
Commission, together with copies of all detailed plans, designs, elevations,
specifications and documents relating thereto, within seven (7) days after
receipt thereof. An application may be filed by the applicant directly with the
Commission at the same time that an application for a building permit is filed
or in lieu of filing for a building permit, if no building permit is required
for the proposed building or environmental change or rehabilitation.
   (b)   If the Commission finds that the building or environmental change or
rehabilitation proposed by the applicant:
      (1)   Shall not adversely affect any significant historical or aesthetic
feature of the property and is appropriate and consistent with the spirit and
purposes of this chapter and the "Standards for Rehabilitation" adopted by the
U.S. Secretary of the Interior, as found in Title 36 of the Code of Federal
Regulations, Part 1208 (formerly 36 CFR Part 67); or
      (2)   Shall remedy conditions imminently dangerous to life, health or
property, as determined in writing by the Director of Building and Housing,  or
the Fire Chief, then the Commission shall grant permission.
   (c)   If the Commission finds that the building or environmental change or
rehabilitation proposed by the applicant shall adversely affect any significant
historical or aesthetic feature of the property or is inappropriate or
inconsistent with the spirit and purposes of this chapter, the Commission shall
disapprove the application and so advise the applicant and the Building
Department in writing within sixty (60) days after receiving the application.
   (d)   If it disapproves the application, the Commission shall have the power
to impose and enforce a waiting period of six (6) months from the date of its
notice of disapproval, during which period the Commission shall conduct
negotiations with the applicant and any other party in an effort to find a
means of preserving the property as follows:
      (1)   With respect to an application involving an alteration, the
Commission and the applicant shall work together during such period to find a
mutually agreeable method of completing the proposed building or environmental
change or rehabilitation.
      (2)   With respect to an application involving a demolition, removal, or
construction, the Commission may in its discretion extend the original waiting
period of six (6) months to one (1) year. During such period and any extension
thereof the Commission and the applicant shall undertake meaningful and
continuing discussions for the purpose of finding a method of saving such
landmark.  The Commission shall also investigate the feasibility of all
available ways and means of preserving the landmark, including without
limitation, inducing by contract or other consideration the creation of
covenants restricting the use of the property, leasing and subleasing the
property for the purposes of preservation, and acquiring by eminent domain or
contract or conveyance all or any part of or interest in the property. If the
Commission and the applicant do not agree on a means of preserving the landmark

time insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other
agency or instrumentality of the federal government. In the case of any deposit
other than the initial deposit made during the period of designation, the

deposited, shall be equal to the amount of public monies on deposit in such
public depository plus of the amount to be so deposited minus the portion or
amount of that total amount that is at the time insured as provided in this
section. The Director may require additional eligible securities to be
deposited to provide for any depreciation which may occur in the market value
of any of the securities so deposited.
 
   (b)    The following securities shall be eligible securities for the
purposes of this section:
      (1)   Bonds, notes or other obligations of or guaranteed as to principal
and interest by the United States or those for which the faith of the United
States is pledged for the payment of principal and interest thereon, by
language specifically appearing therein and not merely by interpretation or
otherwise;
      (2)   Bonds, notes, debentures, or other obligations or securities issued
by any U.S. government agency, or the export-import bank of Washington; bonds,
notes or other obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the
United States or those for which the faith of the United States is pledged for
the payment of principal and interest thereon, by interpretation or otherwise
and not by language appearing in the instrument specifically providing such
guarantee;
      (3)   Bonds and other obligations of the State of Ohio guaranteed as to
principal and interest by the State of Ohio or those for which the full faith
and credit of the State of Ohio is pledged for the payment of principal and
interest thereon by language specifically appearing therein and not merely by
interpretation or otherwise;
      (4)   Bonds and other obligations of any county, township, school
district, municipal corporation, including the City, or other legally
constituted taxing subdivision of the State of Ohio, which is not, at the time
of such deposit, in default in the payment of principal or interest on any of
its bonds or other obligations, for which the full faith and credit of the
issuing subdivision is pledged;
      (5)   Obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the Ohio
student loan commission.
      (6)   A no-load money market mutual fund that is registered as an

the highest letter or numerical rating provided by at least one nationally
recognized standard rating service, consisting exclusively of obligations
described in division (b)(1) or (2) of this section and repurchase agreements
secured by such obligations.
 
   (c)   The City may agree with an eligible depository to use the provisions
and procedures in Ohio R.C. Chapter 135 as the means of securing deposits of
the City and may accept as eligible securities for purposes of this section any
securities which are part of a pool of securities authorized in Ohio R.C.
Chapter 135.
 
   (d)   If a depository of the City's funds fails to pay over any part of the
deposit made by the City, the Director shall sell at public sale any of the
pledged securities deposited with the Director pursuant to this section. Thirty
(30) days notice of such sale shall be given in a newspaper of general
circulation within Cuyahoga County. Pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 135, when a
sale of eligible securities has been so made and upon payment to the Director
of the purchase money, the Director shall transfer such eligible securities,
whereupon the absolute ownership of such eligible securities shall pass to the
purchasers, and any surplus remaining after deducting the amount due the City
and the expenses of sale shall be paid to the depository of the City's funds.
 
   (e)   An eligible depository may, by written notice to the Director,
designate a qualified trustee and deposit the eligible securities required by
this section with the trustee for safekeeping for the account of the City and
the eligible depository, as their respective rights to and interest in such
securities under this section may appear and be asserted by written notice to
or demand upon the trustee pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 135. In such case, the
Director shall accept the written receipt of the trustee describing the
securities which have been deposited with the trustee by the eligible
depository, a copy of which shall also be delivered to the eligible depository.
Thereupon all such securities so deposited with the trustee are, pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 135 deemed to be pledged with the Director and to be
deposited with him, for all the purposes of this section. The qualified trustee
designated to perform the duties pursuant to this division (e) must be approved
by the Director prior to designation by the eligible depository.
 
   (f)   The Director may make provisions for the exchange and release of
securities and the substitution of other eligible securities.

thereof located in the State of Ohio, without compliance with Ohio R.C.
1109.03, 1109.04, 1109.17 and 1109.18, or as such sections may be amended or
renumbered, or any provision of this chapter and without becoming subject to
Ohio R.C. 1109.15, as such section may be amended or renumbered, or any other
law of Ohio relative to the exercise by corporations of trust powers generally,
is qualified to act as trustee for the safekeeping of securities under this
section.
 
   (h)   Notwithstanding the fact that an eligible depository is required to
pledge eligible securities in certain amounts to secure deposits of public
monies, a trustee shall have no duty or obligation to determine the
eligibility, market value, or face value of any securities deposited with the
trustee by an eligible depository. This applies in all situations including,
without limitation, a substitution or exchange of securities.
 
   (i)   Any charges or compensation of a designated trustee for acting as such
under this section shall be paid by the eligible depository and in no event
shall be chargeable to the City or to the Director or to any officer of the
City. Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 135.18, such charges or compensation shall not be a
lien or charge upon the securities deposited for safekeeping prior or superior
to the rights to and interests in such securities of the City or of the
Director. Pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 135, the Director and the Director's
bondsmen or surety shall be relieved from any liability to the City or to the
eligible depository for the loss or destruction of any securities deposited
with a qualified trustee pursuant to this section.

      (d)   Such additional information as may be required by the Cash
Management and Investment Policy promulgated pursuant to Section

   When it is deemed necessary to make a public improvement to be paid for in
whole or in part by special assessments, Council shall declare the necessity
therefor by resolution, as provided for by the statutes of Ohio and shall
determine the portion of the cost of such improvement to be assessed.  Such
resolution, upon its passage, shall be certified to the Director of Finance who
shall thereupon proceed to make an assessment report in accordance with the
method of assessment provided for in the resolution, which report shall be
filed with Council and shall show the lots and lands assessed, and the amount

(Ord. 59-60.  Enacted 4-27-59.)
145.03 NOTICE.

   The Board of Review of Assessments shall consist of the Mayor, Director of

improvement shall proceed and in the same ordinance, levy the assessments as
reported by the Board and direct that bids for the work be called for; or
Council may postpone the levying of the assessments until the contract price of
the improvement and the actual total cost has been determined.  If the actual
total cost be less than the estimated cost, the assessments as reported by the
Board shall be reduced pro rata by the Director of Finance and reported to
Council.  If the cost be greater than the estimated cost, the assessment shall,
in like manner, be increased pro rata but no assessments which have been so
increased shall be levied without a notice of the increase being first
published as provided in Section
145.03.  Where the levy of assessments is postponed, the assessment shall be
levied in a separate ordinance.
(Ord. 59-60.  Enacted 4-27-59.)
145.07 SUPPLEMENTARY ASSESSMENT.
   Upon completion of any improvement, if there remains any surplus unexpended
in a fund for the purpose for which such assessment was made, the Director of

improvement, the Director of Finance shall report to Council a supplementary
assessment calculated in the same manner as the original assessments, which
supplementary assessment shall be made by ordinance of Council and certified
for collection as is provided in the case of original assessments.  But no
supplementary assessments shall be levied after the expiration of one year from

relation thereto the same as hereinbefore provided for the original
assessments, so far as the same may be applicable.
(Ord. 59-60.  Enacted 4-27-59.)

159.01 REGULATION OF DISCHARGES.
   (a)   No person shall discharge or cause or allow to be discharged into the

public nuisance;
      (5)    Be in violation of any rule or regulation for sewer use adopted by

   (b)    No person shall discharge or cause or allow to be discharged into the
sanitary sewer or storm water collection, storage and sewer systems any
wastewater which is hereby deemed by the Director to constitute an unacceptable
discharge because it contains any of the following:
      (1)    Liquids, solids, or gases which by reason of their nature or
quantity are, or may be sufficient, either alone or by interaction with other
substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the

nature include, but are not limited to, gasoline, kerosene, naptha, benzene,
toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates,
perchlorates, bromates, carbides, hydrides and sulfides. Discharges of this
nature must be monitored to ensure that the Lower Explosive Limit (L.E.L.) of
the explosion hazard meter located at the point of discharge into the sewer
system is never exceeded by five percent (5%) in any two successive readings or
by ten percent (10%) in any single reading;
      (2)    Gaseous, liquid or solid substances which when discharged into the
sewer systems may alone or by interaction with other substances interfere with
any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to human beings or
animals, inhibit aquatic life, create a hazard to recreation in the receiving
waters or the effluent from the wastewater treatment plant or create a hazard
as defined in the federal Clean Water Act;
      (3)    Construction materials, ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw,
shavings, metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar, asphalt, plastic, wood, paunch
manure, bones, hair, hides or fleshing, grass clippings, wastepaper, or any
solid or viscous substance capable of causing obstruction to the flow in sewers
or of otherwise interfering with the proper operation of the sewer systems;
      (4)    Water or waste containing fats, wax, grease or oils, whether
emulsified or not, in excess of 100 mg/l or which contains substances which may
solidify or become viscous at temperatures between 1° C and 65° C at the point
of discharge into the systems;
      (5)    Water, waste or steam with a temperature in excess of 65° C (150°
F);
      (6)   Water or waste having a PH lower than 5.5 or higher than 10.0 or
which may cause corrosion or deterioration of the systems. Materials of this
nature include, but are not limited to, acids, alkalis, sulfides, concentrated
chloride and fluoride compounds and substances which will react with water to
form acidic products;
      (7)    Water or waste containing total cyanide in excess of five (5) mg/
l or containing "readily releasable cyanide" (cyanide released at a temperature
of 65° C (150° F) and PH of 2.5) in excess of two (2) mg/l;
      (8)    Radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration
that they violate regulations or orders issued by the authority having control
over their use and/or may cause damage or hazards to the sewer systems, human
beings or animals;

with other substances in the sewer systems, are capable of producing
objectionable odors or colors or which may otherwise constitute or create a
public nuisance;
      (10)    Garbage that has not been ground or comminuted to such a degree
that all particles will be carried freely in suspension under flow conditions
normally prevailing in the sewer systems with no particle greater than one-half
(1/2) inch in any dimension;
      (11)    Wastewater or storm water flow rates which exceed the design
capacity of any component of the sewer systems; or
      (12)    Water which increases the hydraulic load on the sewer systems,
including but not limited to cooling, storm, surface, subsurface, drainage,
swimming pool or other relatively unpolluted water.
   (c)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any agreement
or arrangement between the City or the NEORSD and any user of the sewer system

   (a)    If wastewater or storm water containing any of the unacceptable
substances described in Section 159.06 of this Chapter is discharged or
proposed to be discharged into the sewer systems of the City or into any sewer
systems tributary thereto, the Director may:
      (1)    Prohibit the continued or proposed discharge of such wastewater or
storm water;
      (2)    Require the discharger to implement on-site modifications to
reduce or eliminate the discharge of such substances in conformity with this
Chapter;
      (3)    Require pretreatment or the creation of storage facilities for
flow equalization to render the discharge acceptable;
      (4)    Where applicable, require the installation of grease, oil or sand
interceptors; or
      (5)    Take such other remedial action as the Director deems desirable or
necessary to achieve the purposes of this Chapter.
   (b)    Any person whose discharge is determined to be unacceptable within
the meaning of this Chapter or of the NEORSD Sewer Use Code may apply to the
Director for permission to render such discharge acceptable by pretreatment.
The Director may approve pretreatment which complies with all requirements and
conditions of this Chapter and the NEORSD Sewer Use Code.
   (c)    Where the Director requires pretreatment or equalization of
wastewater or storm water flows:
      (1)    Plans, specifications and other pertinent data or information
relating to pretreatment or flow equalization facilities required under
division (a)(3) of this Section shall be submitted to the Director for review
and approval prior to their implementation. No subsequent alterations or
additions to such facilities shall be made without prior notice to and approval
of the Director. Notwithstanding any approval by the Director, discharges from
such facilities must comply with applicable codes, ordinances, rules,
regulations or orders of all governmental authorities having jurisdiction over
unacceptable discharges.
      (2)    Pretreatment and flow equalization facilities shall be maintained
in good working order and operated efficiently by the owner at the owner's
expense, and shall comply with the requirements of this Chapter and all other
applicable codes, ordinances, laws, rules and regulations. If for any reason, a
facility does not or cannot comply with any provision of this Chapter, the
owner, lessee, agent or person responsible for the facility shall immediately
notify the Director so that action may be taken to protect persons, property
and the sewer systems.
         (Ord. 09-36.  Enacted 3-23-09.)
159.03 STORM AND SANITARY SEWER CONNECTIONS.
   (a)   Downspout and Roof Drains.  Downspout and roof drains shall not be
connected to any sanitary sewer, but shall be connected to storm sewers where
independent storm sewers are available, except that:
      (1)   The City may require the owner of a property to disconnect the
downspout from the storm sewer system and to have it splash at grade under the
following conditions:
         A.   Whenever a building foundation water problem exists that can be
alleviated by diverting runoff from downspouts away from the building
foundation, thereby avoiding the need for costly remedial work; or
         B.   Wherever instructed by the City after a prior determination has
been made by the City that rain water is entering into the sanitary sewer
system from the property's storm drains or sewers.
      (2)   The following requirements must be met for approval to be given for
disconnecting a downspout:
         A.   The splash block's direct flow shall be far enough from the house
so that it cannot flow back toward the building foundation wall; and
         B.   Water draining across the property shall not create significant
flooding problems on other property; and
         C.   Additional runoff, once diverted away from the house, shall drain
without major ponding on the site; and
         D.   A permit for downspout disconnection shall be issued by the
Director of Public Works to the property owner, lessee or party in control
after application is made, and subsequent inspection and City approval. The
permit shall require compliance with this Chapter. The permit will be rescinded
if the disconnected downspout runoff creates a nuisance condition on other
property. The downspout will then have to be reconnected to the storm sewer;
and
         E.   If, in the opinion of the City, the property is not suited for
downspout disconnection, a permit will not be issued. The property owner,
lessee or party in control may submit a drainage plan prepared by a licensed
surveyor that shows that any rainwater discharging at grade will not adversely
affect other property, which shall then be considered by the Director.
      (3)   If a determination is made by the City that the disconnection of a
downspout has not significantly reduced the risk of basement flooding, or has
caused a significant flooding problem on the property or off of the property,
the City may require the reconnection of the downspout or, if the City required
disconnection of the downspout, the City may reconnect the downspout, if
requested, at no cost to the owner, lessee or party in control of the property.
      (4)   A downspout may be disconnected from the sewer system and attached
to a rain collecting container without approval of the City, if such container
drains and/or overflows in such a manner as to meet the requirements in this
Section for the disconnection of a downspout. The City may order the removal of
such a container and reconnection of the downspout as set forth in this Section
on the same basis as set forth in this Section for disconnected downspouts. Any
such containers must meet the requirements of any other ordinances that may be
applicable.
   (b)   Roof, Driveway and Yard Drains. Roof, driveway and yard drains shall
not be connected to any sanitary sewer, but shall be connected to storm sewers
where independent storm sewers are available.
   (c)   Window Wells.  All window wells shall be connected to the storm
sewers. In the alternative, the window well masonry, or earth around the
masonry, may be built up to eight inches above grade so as to prevent drainage
of storm waters into the sanitary sewers.
   (d)   Maintenance. All private sewer connections, and all parts thereof,
shall be maintained in a safe, sanitary and good operating condition at all
times.
   (e)   Test Tees. All properties shall have a test tee which has an opening
at ground level in a visible and accessible location on the property.

front of the same and/or to determine whether the sewer connections are
connected to the proper sewer system; and/or
   (c)   Any downspout or drain on or about any building, driveway or parking
lot to determine whether or not the downspout or drain discharges water into a
sanitary or storm sewer.
      (Ord. 09-36.  Enacted 3-23-09.)
159.05 EXCAVATION FOR TESTS; RESTORATION OF PROPERTY.
   On entering any lot or parcel of land for any test as permitted in this
Chapter, the Director of Public Works or the Director's designee may excavate
and do such other work as may be necessary to make the tests authorized. Upon
the completion of the tests the Director shall cause the premises to be
restored as nearly as practicable to their condition before such tests were
made.
(Ord. 09-36.  Enacted 3-23-09.)
159.06 NUISANCES, VIOLATIONS, AND ABATEMENT.

173.01 FINDINGS.
   Council finds that the areas designated as Community Reinvestment Areas
("CRAs") in this Chapter constitute areas within which housing facilities or
structures of historical significance are located and within which new housing
construction or repair of existing facilities or structures has been
discouraged by market conditions. A Housing Survey exists in the office of the
Housing Officer for each CRA designated in this Chapter.
(Ord. 16-33.  Enacted 3-28-16.)
173.02 HOUSING COUNCIL.
   (a)   Purpose and Duties. In order to fulfill the requirements of Ohio
Revised Code (R.C.) Section 3735.69, or any successor section including such
requirement, and to enhance and promote the preservation and development of the
City, there is hereby created a Housing Council for the purpose of making an
annual inspection of properties within any designated CRA in the City, as
defined by R.C. Section  3735.65, for which a tax exemption has been granted
under R.C. Section 3735.67, and to report to the State of Ohio summarizing the
activities and projects for which an exemption has been granted. The
inspections of properties are for the purpose of ensuring that the properties
are properly maintained. The designation of any CRA shall be reviewed
biennially by the Housing Council to determine whether housing conditions
justify the maintenance of the CRA. The Housing Council shall make a
recommendation to City Council as to whether the designated area should remain
the same, be amended, or be eliminated. The Housing Council shall hear appeals
from the denial of certification or the revocation of tax exemptions made by
the Housing Officer.
   (b)    Membership.   The Housing Council shall consist of seven members. Two
members shall be appointed by City Council; two members shall be appointed by
the Mayor; one member shall be appointed by the City's Planning Commission; and
these five members shall appoint two residents of the City of Shaker Heights as
members. Terms for each member shall be three years. An unexpired term
resulting from a vacancy shall be filled in the same manner as the initial
appointment is made.
   (c)    Membership Representation.  The appointing authorities for the
Housing Council shall work together to ensure in their appointments, as
supplemented pursuant to subsection (e) of this Section, that there is balanced
representation from each of the following groups located within the City, as
required by ORC Section 176.01:
      (1)    Institutions that lend money for housing;
      (2)    Nonprofit builders and developers of housing;
      (3)    For-profit builders and developers of housing;

needs and fair housing issues within the subdivisions served by the board;

subdivisions served by the board;
      (9)    The elected officials of the political subdivisions served by the
board;
      (10)    Such other groups or individuals that the appointing authority
determines are necessary to provide balanced advice on housing plans and
programs.
   (d)    Meetings.  The Housing Council shall meet at least annually, or as
needed, as determined by City Council or the Chairperson of the Housing
Council.  The annual inspection of properties granted tax exemption by the
Council shall constitute a meeting for the purpose of the annual meeting
requirement. The Housing Council shall choose from among its members a
Chairperson, and such other officers as it determines are needed. At least four
members present at a meeting shall comprise a quorum of the Housing Council.
   (e)   Housing Advisory Board. The Housing Council is designated to serve as
the City's Housing Advisory Board pursuant to the authority of ORC Section
176.01(E)(2), or any successor section, for the purposes set forth in Section
130.01 of the Codified Ordinances and as required by ORC Section 176.01, or any
successor section including such requirement. The Mayor, with the approval of
Council, shall, if necessary to achieve the balanced representation required by

Board.

the following:
      (1)   That there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in

prevent or terminate any such violation or remedy such situation, and/or may
take action itself or through contractors hired for such purpose to abate the
violation or situation in the same manner as the abatement of nuisances
pursuant to Chapter
107 of the Codified Ordinances. If the City takes action on its own or through
contractors hired for such purpose to abate the violation or situation, the

the property be immediately vacated.
(Ord. 17-91.  Enacted 11-13-17.)

meanings:
   (a)   "Admission charge" means the charge made for the right or privilege to
enter into a place; provided, however, that if such charge includes rental of

such tax to be returned and paid in the manner provided in Section
501.04 by the person selling the ticket.
   (c)   A tax of three percent (3%) on the amount paid for admission to any
public performance for profit at any roof garden, cabaret or other similar

organizations, societies or organizations for the prevention of cruelty to
children or animals or societies or organizations conducted for the sole
purpose of maintaining symphony orchestras and receiving substantial support

thereof inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual.
      (2)   Exclusively to the benefit of persons in the military or naval
forces of the United States, or of National Guard organizations, reserve
officer associations or posts or organizations of war veterans, or auxiliary
units or societies of any such posts or organizations, if such posts,
organizations, units or societies are organized in the State of Ohio, and if no
part of their net earnings inure to the benefit of any private stockholder or

whose benefit such event was held shall file an itemized statement with the
Director of Finance setting forth the amount of money actually received by such
treasurer together with the expenses of promoting and conducting such event. 
Such statement shall be used as a basis of subsequent requests for exemption
from admissions tax for the benefit of such institution, society or
organization and if such statement shows a disproportionate expenditure for
promoting and conducting of such event, in relation to the profits, if any, no
such exemption shall thereafter be allowed to such institution, society or
organization.
 
   (c)   The exemption from tax provided in this section shall not be allowed
to any institution, society or organization which does not control the sale of
admissions to the event for which the exemption is requested, nor shall any
exemption be allowed where talent, services or other items are compensated for
on a percentage basis if such percentage results in a payment in excess of the

501.04 COLLECTION OF TAX.
   (a)   Every person receiving any payment on which a tax is levied under this
chapter shall collect the amount of the tax imposed from the person making the
admission payment.  The tax required to be collected under this chapter shall
be deemed to be held in trust by the person required to collect the same until
paid to the Director of Finance as herein provided.  Any person required to
collect the tax imposed under this chapter who fails to remit the same to the
Director in the manner prescribed by this chapter, whether such failure be the
result of his own act or the result of acts or conditions beyond his control,

or a four (4) or five (5) week policy month period as the case may be.
 
   (c)   Payment or remittance of the tax collected may be made by check,
unless payment or remittance is otherwise required by the Director of Finance,
but payment by check shall not relieve the person collecting the tax from
liability for payment and remittance of the tax to the Director unless the
check is honored and is in the full and correct amount.  The person receiving
any payment for admissions shall make out a return upon such forms and setting
forth such information as the Director may require, showing the amount of the
tax upon admissions for which he is liable for the preceding monthly period,
and shall sign and transmit the same to the Director with a remittance for the
amount; provided, that the Director may in his discretion require verified
annual returns from any person receiving admission payments setting forth such
additional information as he may deem necessary to determine correctly the
amount of tax collected and payable.
 
   (d)   Whenever any theater, circus, show, exhibition, entertainment or
amusement makes an admission charge which is subject to the tax herein levied,
and the same is of a temporary or transitory nature, of which the Director of
Finance shall be the judge, the Director may require the report and remittance
of the admission tax immediately upon the collection of the same, at the
conclusion of the performance or exhibition, or at the conclusion of the series
of performances or exhibitions or at such other times as the Director shall
determine.  Failure to comply with any requirement of the Director as to report
and remittance of the tax as required shall be a violation of this chapter.

levied shall, as to admission charges and tax collections, be at all reasonable
times subject to examination and audit by the Director of Finance.  If the tax

the tax, interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month from the time when
the tax became due until paid.
(Ord. 5247.  Enacted 9-23-47.)
 
501.05 CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.
   Any person conducting or operating any place for entrance to which an
admission charge is made shall, on a form prescribed by the Director of
Finance, make application to and procure from the Director a certificate of

shall continue valid until December 31 of the year in which the same is
issued.  The certificate of registration, or duplicate original copies thereof
to be issued by the Director without additional charge, shall be posted in a
conspicuous place in each ticket or box office where tickets of admission are
sold.
(Ord. 5247.  Enacted 9-23-47.)
 
501.06 CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION FOR TEMPORARY OR TRANSITORY AMUSEMENT.
   Whenever a certificate of registration is obtained for the purpose of
operating or conducting a temporary or transitory amusement, entertainment or
exhibition by persons who are not the owners, lessees or custodians of the
building, lots or place where the amusement is to be conducted, the tax imposed
by this chapter shall be reported and remitted as provided in Section
501.04 by the owner, lessee or custodian, unless paid by the person conducting
the place.  The applicant for a certificate of registration for such purpose
shall furnish with the application therefor the name and address of the owner,
lessee or custodian of the premises upon which the amusement is to be
conducted, and such owner, lessee or custodian shall be notified by the
Director of the issuance of such certificate and the joint liability for
collection and remittance of such tax.
(Ord. 5247.  Enacted 9-23-47.)

A copy of such rules and regulations shall be published in a newspaper of

this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that

not himself a party to the offense.
 
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the

         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An "offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant" includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.

         B.   "Public servant" has the same meaning as in Section
725.01.
 
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
 
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
 
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.

   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

701.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
701.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
701.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
701.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor's effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor's criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
 
   (f)   As used in this section, "drug abuse offense" has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.02)
 
701.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
 
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
701.09.
 
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
 
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
 
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
 
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
 
701.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent

danger of drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a
hospital, clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider
whose alcohol and drug addiction services are certified pursuant to Ohio R.C.

penetration in violation of former Ohio R.C. 2907.12.  As used in this
subsection, “counseling services” include services provided in an informal
setting by a person who, by education or experience, is competent to provide
those services.
   (h)   No disclosure of information pursuant to this section gives rise to
any liability or recrimination for a breach of privilege or confidence.

involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.

the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and

745.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   Where more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
 
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
745.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
745.05,
745.06, or
745.08,
745.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
745.15 or
745.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
 745.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
745.05 or
745.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
 745.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
 745.05,
745.06 or
745.08, Section
745.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
745.15 or
745.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
745.05 or
745.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series. 
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
 
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing which has intrinsic
worth to its owner and which is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount which would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing such
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any property, real or personal, not covered under
subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair market
value of such property or services.  As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
 
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which such property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of such security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
such livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of such instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received thereby, is
prima-facie evidence of the value of such instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of such
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for such services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in such notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of such
services.(ORC 2913.61)

file an application with the Director, or his designated representative.  The
application shall contain information which demonstrates that bringing the
source of sound or activity for which the special variance is sought into
compliance with this chapter would constitute an unreasonable hardship on the
applicant, on the community, or on other persons.  Notice of an application for
a special variance shall be given by the Director or his representative to
persons who frequent the area of the sound or activity and who may be adversely
affected by the granting of the variance.  Any individual who claims to be

his claim.
 
   (c)   In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the Director
or his designated representative shall balance the hardship to the applicant,
the community, and other persons of not granting the special variance against
the adverse impact on the health, safety and welfare of persons affected, the
adverse impact on property affected, and any other adverse impact of granting
the special variance.  Applicants for special variances and persons contesting
special variances may be required to submit any information the Director or his
representative may reasonably require.  In granting or denying an application,
the Director or his representative shall place on public file a copy of the
decision and the reasons for denying or granting the special variance.
 
   (d)   Special variances shall be granted by notice to the applicant
containing all necessary conditions, including a time limit on the permitted
activity.  The special variance shall not become effective until all conditions
are agreed to by the applicant.  Noncompliance with any conditions of the
special variances shall terminate it and subject the person holding it to those
provisions of this chapter regulating the source of sound or activity for which
the special variance was granted.
 
   (e)   Application for extension of time limits specified in special
variances or for modification of other substantial conditions shall be treated
like applications for initial special variances.
 
   (f)   The Director or his designated representative may issue guidelines
approved by Council defining the procedures to be followed in applying for a
special variance and the criteria to be considered in deciding whether to grant
a special variance.
 
   (g)   Enforcement of this chapter shall be stayed as to any person filing an
application for a special variance pursuant to this section, until such time as
the application is acted upon by the Director or his designated representative.

chapter.
(Ord. 78-107.  Enacted 9-25-78.)
 
755.09 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   Except where a person is acting in good faith to comply with an abatement
order issued pursuant to this chapter, violation of any provision of this
chapter shall be cause for a notice of violation to be issued by any City law
enforcement officer.
(Ord. 78-107.  Enacted 9-25-78.)
 
755.10 OTHER REMEDIES.
   No provision of this chapter shall be construed to impair any common law or

or damage arising from any violation of this chapter or from other law.
(Ord. 78-107.  Enacted 9-25-78.)
 
755.11 EXCEPTIONS.

755.12 APPLICABILITY.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to permit conduct prohibited by
any other statute, ordinance or regulation, or to prohibit the enforcement
thereof.

cumulative cost and impact of permits granted previously during the year for
other parades or special events, or unreasonable interference with the right of

application period would not be detrimental to the peace, health, safety and
welfare of the City, in consideration of the factors set forth in subsection
(f) hereof, the size of the proposed parade or special event, the proposed
route, the length of time of the event itself, and the time in which the City
has to prepare and allocate its equipment, vehicles and manpower for the event.
 
   (h)   The Mayor’s designee may promulgate written rules and regulations for
the administration of this section, a copy of which, if so promulgated, shall

speed as to obstruct or impede the normal flow of traffic; or operate, stop,
stand, or park such vehicle for the purpose of selling or soliciting purchases
of such goods, wares, or merchandise, in any congested area, or in such manner
as to obstruct or impede the normal flow of traffic or inconvenience to the

1113.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of any
traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this Traffic
Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. 
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.  Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
1103.991 of the Traffic Code.  (ORC 4511.12)
 
1113.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
 
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
 
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
 
   (d)   Council or the Director of Safety may designate additional through
streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic control
signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets or
highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection and
shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
 
1113.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
1113.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
1113.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
1113.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)
 
1113.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A steady yellow "X": A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red "X" signal indication.
   (c)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A steady red "X": A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
      (ORC 4511.131)
 
1113.05 SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"don't walk", or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes "walk",
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes "don't
walk", means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word "wait" if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.  (ORC 4511.14)

SIGNAL.
   The driver of a vehicle who approaches an intersection where traffic is
controlled by traffic control signals shall do all of the following, if the
signal facing the driver exhibits no colored lights, or colored lighted arrows,
exhibits a combination of such lights or arrows that fails to clearly indicate
the assignment of right of way, or if the vehicle is a bicycle, the signals are
otherwise malfunctioning, due to the failure of a vehicle detector to detect
the presence of the bicycle:
   (a)   Stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, stop before entering
the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or, if none, stop before
entering the intersection;

1131.01 DRIVING UPON RIGHT SIDE OF ROADWAY; EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven upon
the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left
of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the
right of way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one- way traffic;
      (5)   When otherwise directed by a police officer or traffic control
device.
   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         A.   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         B.   When preparing for a left turn;
         C.   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the
right-hand lane to continue on the driver’s intended route.
      (2)   Nothing in subsection (b)(1) of this section requires a driver of a
slower vehicle to compromise the driver’s safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.
   (c)   Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the
left of the center line of the roadway, except when authorized by official
traffic control devices designating certain lanes to the left of the center of
the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use the lanes, or
except as permitted under subsection (a) (2) hereof.
   Subsection (c) hereof shall not be construed as prohibiting the crossing of
the center line in making a left turn into or from an alley, private road or
driveway.  (ORC 4511.25)
1131.02  PASSING TO RIGHT WHEN PROCEEDING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.
   Operators of vehicles proceeding in opposite directions shall pass each
other to the right, and upon roadways having width for not more than one line

1131.03 OVERTAKING, PASSING TO LEFT; DRIVER'S DUTIES.
   The following rules govern the overtaking and passing of vehicles proceeding
in the same direction:
   (a)   The operator of a vehicle overtaking another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction shall, except as provided in subsection (c) hereof, signal to
the vehicle to be overtaken, shall pass to the left thereof at a safe distance,
and shall not again drive to the right side of the roadway until safely clear
of the overtaken vehicle.  When a motor vehicle overtakes and passes a bicycle,
three feet or greater is considered a safe passing distance.
   (b)   Except when overtaking and passing on the right is permitted, the
operator of an overtaken vehicle shall give way to the right in favor of the
overtaking vehicle at the latter's audible signal, and he shall not increase
the speed of his vehicle until completely passed by the overtaking vehicle.
   (c)   The operator of a vehicle overtaking and passing another vehicle
proceeding in the same direction on a divided street or highway as defined in
Section
1131.31, a limited access highway as defined in Ohio R.C. 5511.02 or a highway
with four or more traffic lanes, is not required to signal audibly to the
vehicle being overtaken and passed.  (ORC 4511.27)
1131.04 OVERTAKING AND PASSING UPON RIGHT.
   (a)   The driver of a vehicle may overtake and pass upon the right of

      (2)   Upon a roadway with unobstructed pavement of sufficient width for
two or more lines of vehicles moving lawfully in the direction being traveled
by the overtaking vehicle.
   (b)   The driver of a vehicle may overtake and pass another vehicle only
under conditions permitting such movement in safety.  The movement shall not be
made by driving off the roadway.  (ORC 4511.28)
1131.05 OVERTAKING, PASSING TO LEFT OF CENTER.
   No vehicle shall be driven to the left of the center of the roadway in
overtaking and passing traffic proceeding in the same direction, unless such
left side is clearly visible and is free of oncoming traffic for a sufficient
distance ahead to permit such overtaking and passing to be completely made,
without interfering with the safe operation of any traffic approaching from the
opposite direction or any traffic overtaken.  In every event the overtaking
vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable and
in the event the passing movement involves the use of a lane authorized for
traffic approaching from the opposite direction before coming within 200 feet
of any approaching vehicle.
(ORC 4511.29)
1131.06 ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON DRIVING UPON LEFT SIDE OF ROADWAY.
   No vehicle shall be driven upon the left side of the roadway under the
following conditions:
   (a)   When approaching the crest of a grade or upon a curve in the highway,
where the operator's view is obstructed within such a distance as to create a
hazard in the event traffic might approach from the opposite direction;
   (b)   When the view is obstructed upon approaching within 100 feet of any
bridge, viaduct or tunnel;
   (c)   When approaching within 100 feet of or traversing any intersection or
railroad grade crossing.
   This section does not apply to vehicles upon a one-way roadway, upon a
roadway where traffic is lawfully directed to be driven to the left side or
under the conditions described in Section
1131.01(a)(2).  (ORC 4511.30)
1131.07 HAZARDOUS OR NO PASSING ZONES.
   (a)   Hazardous zones, commonly called "no passing zones," shall consist of
an auxiliary yellow line marked on the roadway pavement and placed parallel to
the normal center line or marked lane line.  When the auxiliary yellow line
appears on the left side in the driver's lane of travel and to the right of the
normal center line or marked lane line, no driver shall drive across the
auxiliary yellow line to overtake and pass another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction.  When auxiliary yellow lines appear on both sides of the normal
center line or marked lane line, drivers proceeding in either direction shall
not drive across such auxiliary yellow lines to overtake and pass another
vehicle proceeding in the same direction.  No driver shall, at any other time,
drive across the yellow auxiliary line when it appears in the driver's lane of
travel, except to make a lawfully permitted left-hand turn under the rules
governing such movement.  No passing signs may also be erected facing traffic
to indicate the beginning and end of each no passing zone.
   When appropriate signs or markings indicating hazardous or no passing zones
are in place and clearly visible, every operator of a vehicle shall obey the
directions thereof, notwithstanding the distance set out in Section
1131.06.  (ORC 4511.31)
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply when all of the

vehicle without exceeding the speed limit.
      (3)   There is sufficient clear sight distance to the left of the center
or center line of the roadway to meet the overtaking and passing provisions of
Section
1131.05, considering the speed of the slower vehicle.
1131.08 DRIVING IN MARKED LANES OR CONTINUOUS LINES OF TRAFFIC.
   Whenever any roadway has been divided into two or more clearly marked lanes
for traffic or wherever traffic is lawfully moving in two or more substantially
continuous lines in the same direction, the following rules apply:
   (a)   A vehicle shall be driven, as nearly as is practicable, entirely
within a single lane or line of traffic and shall not be moved from such lane
or line until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made
with safety.
   (b)   Upon a roadway which is divided into three lanes and provides for two-
way movement of traffic, a vehicle shall not be driven in the center lane
except when overtaking and passing another vehicle where the roadway is clearly
visible and such center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance, or
when preparing for a left turn, or where such center lane is at the time
allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the direction the vehicle is
proceeding and is posted with signs to give notice of such allocation.
   (c)   Official signs may be erected directing specified traffic to use a
designated lane or designating those lanes to be used by traffic moving in a
particular direction regardless of the center of the roadway, or restricting
the use of a particular lane to only buses during certain hours or during all
hours, and drivers of vehicles shall obey the directions of such signs.
   (d)   Official traffic control devices may be installed prohibiting the
changing of lanes on sections of roadway and drivers of vehicles shall obey the
directions of every such device.  (ORC 4511.33)
1131.09 FOLLOWING TOO CLOSELY.
   The operator of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more
closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of such
vehicle, and the traffic upon and the condition of the street.  (ORC 4511.34)
1131.10 TURNING AT INTERSECTIONS.
   The driver of a vehicle intending to turn at an intersection shall be
governed by the following rules:
   (a)   Approach for a right turn and a right turn shall be made as close as
practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway.
   (b)   At any intersection where traffic is permitted to move in both
directions on each roadway entering the intersection, an approach for a left
turn shall be made in that portion of the right half of the roadway nearest the
center line thereof and by passing to the right of such center line where it
enters the intersection and after entering the intersection the left turn shall
be made so as to leave the intersection to the right of the center line of the
roadway being entered.  Whenever practicable the left turn shall be made in
that portion of the intersection to the left of the center of the intersection.
   (c)   At any intersection where traffic is restricted to one direction on
one or more of the roadways, the driver of a vehicle intending to turn left at
any such intersection shall approach the intersection in the extreme left-hand
lane lawfully available to traffic moving in the direction of travel of such
vehicle, and after entering the intersection the left turn shall be made so as
to leave the intersection, as nearly as practicable, in the left-hand lane of
the roadway being entered lawfully available to the traffic moving in that
lane.
   (d)   Markers, buttons or signs may be placed within or adjacent to
intersections and thereby require and direct that a different course from that
specified in this section be traveled by vehicles turning at an intersection,
and when such markers, buttons or signs are so placed, no operator of a vehicle
shall turn such vehicle at an intersection other than as directed and required
by such markers, buttons or signs.

a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,

arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person's own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person's expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
"national highway traffic safety administration" means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.

violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.

subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.

year filed with the Department of Education in compliance with rule 3301-35-08
of the Ohio Administrative Code, a copy of the school's report for the parents
of the school's pupils certifying that the school meets Ohio minimum standards
for nonchartered, non-tax supported schools and presents evidence of this
filing to the jurisdiction from which it is requesting the establishment of a
school zone.
         C.   As used in this section, "school zone" means that portion of a
street or highway passing a school fronting upon the street or highway that is
encompassed by projecting the school property lines to the fronting street or
highway.  Upon request from the Municipality for streets and highways under its
jurisdiction, the Ohio Director of Transportation may extend the traditional
school zone boundaries.  The distances in subsections (b)(1)C.1. to 3. hereof
shall not exceed 300 feet per approach per direction and are bounded by
whichever of the following distances or combinations thereof the Director
approves as most appropriate:
            1.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school building
lines normal to the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            2.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school property
lines intersecting the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            3.   The distance encompassed by the special marking of the
pavement for a principal school pupil crosswalk plus a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction of highway;
Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the Director's initial
action on August 9, 1976, establishing all school zones at the traditional
school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property lines, except when
those boundaries are extended as provided in subsections (b)(1)A. and C.
hereof.
         D.   As used in this subsection, "crosswalk" has the meaning given
that term in Section
1101.09.  The Director may, upon request by resolution of Council, and upon
submission by the Municipality of such engineering, traffic and other
information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school zone on any
portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that includes a
crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school during
recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a
straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of the crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet.  Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet
on each approach direction of the State route;
      (2)   Twenty-five miles per hour in all other portions of the
Municipality, except on State routes outside business districts, through
highways outside business districts and alleys;
      (3)   Thirty-five miles per hour on all State routes or through highways
within the Municipality outside business districts;
      (4)   Fifteen miles per hour on all alleys within the Municipality.
   (c)   It is prima-facie unlawful for any person to exceed any of the speed
limitations in subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(4) hereof, or any declared pursuant
to this section by the Director or local authorities and it is unlawful for any
person to exceed the speed limitation in subsection (d) hereof.  No person
shall be convicted of more than one violation of this section for the same
conduct, although violations of more than one provision of this section may be
charged in the alternative in a single affidavit.
   (d)   No person shall operate a motor vehicle upon the streets or highways
at a speed exceeding fifty-five miles per hour.
   (e)   In every charge of violation of this section the affidavit and warrant
shall specify the time, place and speed at which the defendant is alleged to
have driven, and in charges made in reliance upon subsection (c) hereof also
the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(4) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit him to bring the
vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the affidavit and
warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is alleged to have
driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and the
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(4) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of subsection (d) hereof.  If the court finds a violation of subsection (b)
(1)A. to (b)(4) hereof, or a limit declared or established pursuant to this
section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction under such
subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If it finds no
violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(4) hereof or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider whether the
evidence supports a conviction under subsection (d) hereof.
   (g)   Points shall be assessed for violation of a limitation under
subsection (d) hereof in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.036.
   (h)   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines upon the basis
of an engineering and traffic investigation that any speed limit set forth in
subsections (b)(1)A. to (d) hereof is greater than is reasonable or safe under
the conditions found to exist at any intersection or other place upon any part
of a State route, the Director shall determine and declare a reasonable and
safe prima-facie speed limit, which shall be effective when appropriate signs
giving notice are erected at the intersection or other part of the State route.
   (i)   Whenever Council determines upon the basis of an engineering and
traffic investigation that the speed permitted by subsections (b)(1)A. to (d)
hereof, on any part of a highway under their jurisdiction, is greater than is
reasonable and safe under the conditions found to exist at such location,
Council may by resolution request the Director to determine and declare a
reasonable and safe prima-facie speed limit.  Upon receipt of such request the
Director may determine and declare a reasonable and safe prima-facie speed
limit at such location, and if the Director does so, then such declared speed
limit shall become effective only when appropriate signs giving notice thereof
are erected at such location by the Municipality.  The Director may withdraw
his declaration of any prima-facie speed limit whenever in his opinion any
altered prima-facie speed becomes unreasonable, and upon such withdrawal, the
declared prima-facie speed shall become ineffective and the signs relating
thereto shall be immediately removed by the Municipality.
   (j)   Council may authorize by ordinance higher prima-facie speeds than
those stated in this section upon through highways, or upon highways or
portions thereof where there are no intersections, or between widely spaced
intersections, provided signs are erected giving notice of the authorized
speed, but Council shall not modify or alter the basic rule set forth in
subsection (a) hereof or in any event authorize by ordinance a speed in excess
of fifty miles per hour.
   Alteration of prima-facie limits on State routes by Council shall not be
effective until the alteration has been approved by the Director.  The Director
may withdraw his approval of any altered prima-facie speed limits whenever in
his opinion any altered prima-facie speed becomes unreasonable, and upon such
withdrawal, the altered prima-facie speed shall become ineffective and the
signs relating thereto shall be immediately removed by the Municipality.
(ORC 4511.21)
   (k)   Whenever, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.21 or this section, the
speed limitations as established herein have been altered, either higher or
lower, and the appropriate signs giving notice have been erected as required,
operators of motor vehicles shall be governed by the speed limitations set
forth on such signs.  It is prima-facie unlawful for any person to exceed the
speed limits posted upon such signs.

motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
 
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver's or commercial driver's license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver's or commercial driver's
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a

offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender's license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class

determining whether a violation of subsection (b) hereof has been or is being
committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or summons for
a violation of that nature or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution
of a person for a violation of that nature, and no law enforcement officer
shall view the interior or visually inspect any automobile being operated on
any street or highway for the sole purpose of determining whether a violation
of that nature has been or is being committed.

person to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant
restraining device in violation of subsection (b)(1) or (3) or the failure of a
person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an automobile being
operated by that person is wearing all of the available elements of a properly
adjusted occupant restraining device, in violation of subsection (b)(2)  of
this section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort
action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.  But the trier of
fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of
evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action
and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic
loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff's failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.  Evidence of that failure

than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.     It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the
occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.

unexpired interval of time, and the meter has been placed in operation.
 
   (b)   No person shall permit a vehicle within his control to be parked in

   J.    To divide the City of Shaker Heights into districts of such number,

   A.    Jurisdiction.  This Zoning Ordinance shall apply to all land, uses,
buildings and structures within the corporate limits of the City of Shaker
Heights.
   B.    General Applicability.  After the effective date of this Zoning
Ordinance, no buildings, structures, uses of land, lots of record or zoning
lots shall be established, altered, moved, divided or maintained except in
accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. Existing buildings,
structures and uses of land that do not comply with the regulations of this
Zoning Ordinance are pursuant to Chapter
1215, Nonconformities.
1210.05 REPEAL OF PREEXISTING CODE.
   The Shaker Heights Zoning Code adopted by the City of Shaker Heights as
ordinance No. 73-151 on November 26, 1973, and as subsequently amended,
together with the Zoning Map which is a part of that Zoning Code, is hereby
superseded and amended to read as set forth in this Zoning Ordinance. This
Zoning Ordinance shall be so interpreted upon all questions of construction
relating to tenure of officers and boards established by the previous Code, to
questions of conforming and nonconforming uses and structures, and to questions
as to the dates upon which such uses or structures become conforming or
nonconforming.
   To the extent that this Zoning Ordinance reestablishes a zoning district of
the same land use category and with the same district designation and name,
this district and its boundaries as indicated on the Zoning Map under the
preexisting Zoning Code shall be deemed as continuing until such time as it may
be amended pursuant to this Zoning Ordinance.
   To the extent that this Zoning Ordinance establishes a zoning district of
the same land use category, but different name from that under the preexisting
Code, this new district name shall replace the old zoning district name on the
Zoning Map, but shall retain its existing boundaries. A zoning district, which
is not reestablished by this Code, is hereby repealed as of the effective date
of this Zoning Ordinance.
   Zoning districts established by this Zoning Ordinance shall become effective
upon the adoption of such Zoning Map amendments by the City Council as are
necessary to give effect to the new districts.
1210.06 INTERPRETATION.
   The provisions of this Zoning Ordinance shall be construed to achieve the
purposes for which they are adopted. In interpreting and applying the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, these provisions shall be held to be the
minimum requirements for the promotion of the public peace, health, safety,
morals, convenience, comfort, prosperity and general welfare.
   It is not intended by this Zoning Ordinance to interfere with or abrogate or
annul any easements, covenants, building restrictions or other agreements
between parties. However, where this Zoning Ordinance imposes a greater
restriction upon the use of buildings or premises or upon the height of
buildings, or requires larger open spaces than are imposed or required by other
laws, rules, regulations or permits, or by easements, covenants, building
restrictions or agreements, the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance shall
govern. For the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance, the following additional
rules of interpretation shall apply:
   A.    In the event of a conflict between the text of these provisions and
any caption, figure, illustration, table, or map; the text of these provisions
shall control; and
   B.    Word usage shall be governed by the standards of Section
1211.01.
1210.07 TRANSITION RULES.
   In determining the applicability of this Zoning Ordinance with respect to
the previously applicable zoning regulations, the following rules shall apply:
   A.    Existing Permitted Uses Rendered as Conditional Uses.  When a lot is
used for a purpose classified as a permitted use prior to the effective date of
this Zoning Ordinance, and such use is classified as a “conditional use” by
this Zoning Ordinance, such use shall be deemed a lawful conditional use for
the purpose of this Zoning Ordinance.
   B.    Principal Uses Rendered Nonconforming.  When a lot is used for a
purpose which was a lawful use before the effective date of this Zoning
Ordinance and this Zoning Ordinance, or any amendment thereto, no longer
classifies such use as either a permitted use or conditional use in the zoning
district in which it is located, such use shall be deemed a legal nonconforming
use and shall be regulated pursuant to Chapter
1215, Nonconformities.
   C.    Principal Buildings, Structures and Lots Rendered Nonconforming. 
Where any building, structure or lot lawfully existing on the effective date of
this Zoning Ordinance does not meet all standards set forth in this Zoning
Ordinance, or any amendment thereto, such building, structure, or lot shall be
deemed nonconforming and shall be regulated pursuant to Chapter
1215, Nonconformities.
   D.    Accessory Uses or Structures Rendered Nonconforming.  When an
accessory use or structure was lawful before the effective date of this Zoning
Ordinance or any amendment hereto, but is rendered nonconforming by the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance or any amendment hereto, such accessory use
or structure shall be deemed a legal nonconforming accessory structure and
shall be regulated pursuant to Chapter
1215, Nonconformities.
   E.    Previously Approved Site Plans.  When a site plan for any structure or
lot has been lawfully approved prior to the effective date of this Zoning
Ordinance, and construction has begun within one (1) year after the approval
and is being diligently pursued to completion, the site plan may be completed
in accordance with the plans on the basis of which the permit was issued and
may, upon completion, be occupied under a certificate of occupancy for the use
originally intended, pursuant to Chapters
1251 and
1252 governing off-street parking and loading.
   F.    Previously Issued Building Permits.  When a building permit for a
building or structure has been lawfully issued prior to the effective date of
this Zoning Ordinance, and construction has begun within six (6) months of the
issuance of such permit and is being diligently pursued to completion, the
building or structure may be completed in accordance with the plans on the
basis of which the building permit was issued and may, upon completion, be
occupied under a certificate of occupancy for the use originally intended,
pursuant to Chapters
1251 and
1252 governing off-street parking and loading.
   G.    Previously Granted Variances.  All variances granted prior to the
effective date of this Zoning Ordinance shall remain in full force and effect.
1210.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of this Zoning Ordinance is held to be unconstitutional or
otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining
provisions shall not be invalidated and shall remain in full force and effect.

      1.   Mailing.  Notice shall be sent by first class mail a minimum of ten
(10) calendar days in advance of the public hearing, to all owners of land
within two hundred (200) feet (inclusive of intervening streets and alleys) of
the periphery of the land subject to the application whose names and addresses
are known by reference to the most recently published ad valorem tax records of
the County Appraiser, except that when the land is improved with a condominium,
notice shall be given to the condominium association.  Notice shall be presumed

   E.    Standards for Variances.  The regulations of this Zoning Ordinance
shall not be varied unless findings based on the evidence are made in each
specific case based on the following criteria:
      1.    Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship or practical difficulty to the owner would result, as distinguished
from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were to be
applied.
      2.    The conditions upon which an application for a variance is based
are unique to the property for which the variance is sought, and are not
applicable, generally, to other properties within the same zoning
classification.
      3.    The purpose of the variance is not based upon a financial hardship
alone.
      4.    The alleged practical difficulty or undue hardship is caused by
this Zoning Ordinance and has not been created by any person having an interest
in the property.
      5.    The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in
which the property is located.
      6.    The granting of the variance will not alter the essential character
of the neighborhood.
   F.    Limitations on Variances.  Limitations on the degree or amount of
variance are established below. These limitations shall constitute the maximum
variance allowed and shall not be interpreted as the recommended variance.
      1.    Off-Street Parking and Loading Variances.  The same off-street
parking facility may be used to satisfy the parking requirements of this Zoning
Ordinance for two (2) or more uses, provided that substantial use of such
facility by each user does not take place at approximately the same hours of
the same days of the week, and provided that the reduction in Off-Street
Parking spaces is no greater than forty percent (40%) of the total number
required if calculated separately. An independent parking study may be
requested for any such requests for variance.
      2.    Building Height.  A variance may be granted to permit greater
height where such additional height would more closely harmonize with adjoining
development if, in the opinion of the Board of Zoning Appeals, such additional
height would result in more appropriate development of the lot and remain
consistent with the intent of the Zoning Ordinance.
      3.    Signs.  A variance may be granted for signs in the C1, C2, CM, O,
and I Districts to permit design flexibility where, in the opinion of the Board
of Zoning Appeals, such signage is necessary for the proper identification of
the business to which such signage is accessory and such signage will be
suitable and appropriate to the proposed location.
      4.    Wireless Telecommunication Facility.  A variance may be granted per
the provisions in Chapter
1243.10 Wireless Telecommunication Facility Regulations.
      5.   Variances of Use Prohibited.  Except as otherwise provided, the
Board of Zoning Appeals shall have no power to authorize a variance which would
establish a nonconforming use where none previously existed. The Board of
Zoning Appeals shall have no power to authorize any use other than permitted in
the Zoning Ordinance nor permit any variance which in effect changes the
classification of use or usurps the legislative authority of the Council.
   G.    Confirmation of Variance by City Council.  Any variance granted by the
Board of Zoning Appeals which results in modification of standards required in
this Zoning Ordinance relating to non-residential building height or offstreet
parking space requirements by a factor greater than twenty percent (20%) shall
require confirmation by ordinance of the City Council prior to the issuance of
any building permit.
   H.    Validity of Variance Time Limit and Extension.  Permits authorized by
the Board of Zoning Appeals for variances or pursuant to appeals from the
regulations of this Zoning Ordinance shall be void one (1) year after the date

to Section
1212.06.B.7, Guarantee of Time Extensions.
1213.05 CONDITIONAL USES.
   A.    Authority.  Conditional Use Permits may be granted in accordance with
the procedures and standards set out in this Chapter and by approval of the
City Planning Commission and confirmation by ordinance duly enacted by the City
Council. Conditional use permits may authorize the development of uses listed
as conditional in the regulations applicable to the district in which the
subject property is located or similar uses as provided by Section
1213.05.D.2.
   B.     Purpose.  Conditional uses are those uses having some special impact
or uniqueness that requires a careful review of their location, design,
configuration, and special impact to determine, against the fixed standards
located in Section
1213.05.H, Standards for Conditional Use Permits, the desirability of
permitting their establishment on any given site. They are uses that may or may
not be appropriate in a particular location depending on a weighing, in each
case, of the public need and benefit against the local impact and effect and
such other factors established herein or by the City Planning Commission.
   C.    Parties Entitled To Seek Conditional Use Permits.  An application for
a conditional use permit may be filed by any person, firm or corporation, or by
any office, department, board, bureau, or commission which has a legal interest
in the property in the form of an ownership, a lease, or a purchase agreement
for the property for which the conditional use permit is requested. If the
applicant is a lessor, the written approval, with signature, of the owner shall
be required as determined necessary by the Zoning Administrator.
   D.    Application for a Conditional Use Permit.  An application for a
conditional use permit shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator on an
official, prescribed form. The application shall be accompanied by the
following plans, data or information unless determined otherwise by the Zoning
Administrator or designee:
      1.    A statement in writing by the applicant and adequate evidence
showing that the proposed conditional use will conform to the standards set
forth in Section
1213.05.H, Standards for Conditional Use Permits. Such information should
include, at a minimum, a description of the use, days and hours of operation,
number of employees, the scope of activities carried on by the proposed
conditional use, and other information as requested by the Zoning
Administrator.
      2.    If the use is not listed as a permitted Conditional Use in the
district for which it is requested, a statement in writing explaining how it is
similar to a use which is listed as a permitted Conditional Use in the district
for which it is requested.
      3.    A site plan of the proposed use identifying the location of all
buildings and structures on the property buildings, structures and pavement
within one hundred (100) feet of the property line or within the adjacent
property, whichever is less open space points of ingress/egress the location,
size and layout of parking property lines, easements and scale, north arrow and
date.
      4.    The existing use and zoning of land within three hundred (300) feet
of the subject site.
      5    A landscape plan showing all proposed and existing landscaping
including berming, buffering and screening.
      6.    Estimated traffic generation of the proposed use.
      7.    Floor plans indicating the internal use of structures.
      8.    Architectural elevations.
      9.    An exterior lighting plan indicating the location of all lighting
fixtures.
      10.    An accurate legal description of the subject property.
      11.    Other information, including a narrative description or product
information as may be required by the City Planning Commission. Such
application shall be forwarded from the Zoning Administrator to the City
Planning Commission for review and, if approved, to City Council for
confirmation.
   E.    Public Hearing for a Conditional Use Permit.  The City Planning
Commission shall hold one (1) public hearing, in accordance with the
requirements of Section
1213.01, Public Hearing Procedures, to review, consider, and approve, approve
with conditions, or disapprove an application after the following public
notification is given by the Zoning Administrator.  Notice shall be provided by
all of the following methods:
      1.    Mailing. Notice shall be sent by first class mail a minimum of ten
(10) calendar days in advance of the public hearing, to all owners of land
within three hundred (300) feet (inclusive of intervening streets and alleys)
of the periphery of the land subject to the application whose names and
addresses are known by reference to the most recently published ad valorem tax
records of the County Appraiser, except that when the land is improved with a
condominium, notice shall be given to the condominium association.  Notice
shall be presumed to have been given when mailed in accordance with these
provisions.
      2.    Legal Notice. Legal notice shall be given by advertisement in a
local newspaper of general circulation no less than four (4) days prior to the
public hearing.
      3.    Notification to Organizations. Notification shall be sent by first
class mail a minimum of ten (10) days prior to the public hearing to any

hearing, the City Planning Commission shall take action on the application for
a conditional use permit and transmit its action to City Council.
      1.    Approval. The City Planning Commission may approve or approve with
conditions the application for a conditional use permit.
      2.    Denial. The City Planning Commission may deny the application for a
conditional use permit. If the City Planning Commission denies the application,
the application process ends. Disapproval of the application for a conditional
use permit shall include a statement of the reasons for the denial.
   If the City Planning Commission approves the application, the Commission
shall, within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the public hearing,
transmit the application to the City Council for the Council's confirmation.
   G.    Action by City Council.  Within a reasonable time after the receipt of
the decision of the City Planning Commission, or its failure to act as above
provided, the City Council either shall confirm the decision by ordinance duly
adopted with or without modifications or conditions, or refer the application
back to the City Planning Commission for further study, or deny the conditional
use permit.
   H.    Standards for Conditional Use Permits. The City Planning Commission or
City Council shall make a determination on Conditional Use Permit applications
based on the following criteria:
      1.    Land Use Policy. The proposed use and development will be in
keeping with the land use policies established by the City Council.
      2.    Ordinance Purposes. The proposed use and development will be in
harmony with the general and specific purposes for which this Zoning Ordinance
was enacted and for which the regulations of the district in question were
established.
      3.    No Nuisance. The proposed use and development will not create any
public nuisance by reason of noise, smoke, odors, vibrations, objectionable
lights or congestion of traffic.
      4.    No Undue Adverse Impact. The proposed use and development will not
have a substantial or undue adverse impact upon adjacent property, the
character of the neighborhood or area, or the public peace, health, safety, and
general welfare.
      5.    No Interference with Surrounding Development. The proposed use and
development will be constructed, arranged, and operated so as not to
excessively interfere with the use and development of neighboring property in
accordance with the applicable district regulations.
      6.    Adequate Public Facilities. The proposed use and development will
be served adequately by essential public facilities and services such as
streets, public utilities, drainage structures, police and fire protection,
refuse disposal, parks, libraries, and schools, or that the applicant will
provide adequately for such services.
      7.    No Traffic Congestion. The proposed use and development will not
cause undue traffic congestion nor draw significant amounts of traffic through
residential streets.
      8.    No Destruction of Significant Features. The proposed use and
development will not result in unnecessary destruction, loss, or damage of any
natural, scenic, or historic feature of significant importance.
      9.    Compliance with Standards. The proposed use and development
complies with all additional standards imposed on it by the particular
provision of this Zoning Ordinance authorizing such use.
   I.    Conditions on Conditional Use Permits. The City Planning Commission
may impose and the City Council may confirm or impose additional conditions and
limitations concerning use, construction, character, location, landscaping,
screening, and other matters relating to the purposes and objectives of this
Zoning Ordinance, upon the premises benefited by a conditional use permit, as
may be necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon
other property and improvements in the vicinity of the subject property or upon
public facilities and services. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in
the Zoning Ordinance granting the conditional use or expressly included in such
ordinance by reference. Violation of any such condition or limitation shall be
a violation of this Zoning Ordinance and shall constitute grounds for
revocation of the conditional use permit.
   J.    Confirmation of Compliance with Conditions. Whenever any conditional
use permit granted pursuant to this Chapter is made subject to conditions or
limitations to be met by the applicant, the applicant shall, upon meeting such
conditions, notify the Zoning Administrator for inspection of compliance. The
Zoning Administrator shall determine whether the applicant has met the
conditions.
   K.    Effect of Issuance of a Conditional Use Permit. The granting of a
conditional use permit authorizes the property to be used in the manner
proposed, but does not alone authorize the establishment or extension of any
use nor the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of
any building or structure without first obtaining any other required permit,
including a building permit.
   L.    Limitations on Conditional Use Permit.  Subject to an extension of
time authorized by the Zoning Ordinance, no conditional use permit shall be
valid for a period longer than one (1) year unless a building permit is issued
and construction is actually begun within that period, and is thereafter
diligently pursued to completion, or the approved use is commenced within that
period. Except when otherwise provided in the Zoning Ordinance granting a
conditional use permit, a conditional use permit shall be deemed to relate to,
and be for the benefit of the use and the lot in question, rather than the
owner or operator of such use or lot.
   M.    Modifications to Conditional Uses. Any modification or intensification
of a conditional use that alters the essential character or operation of the
use in a way not intended at the time the conditional use was granted, as
evidenced by the record or language of the Zoning Ordinance, shall require a
new conditional use permit. The property owner/operator or his authorized
representative shall apply for such conditional use permit prior to any
modification of the use of property. The Zoning Administrator shall determine
whether the proposed modification or intensification represents an alteration
in the essential character of the original conditional use as approved. The
operator of the conditional use shall provide the Zoning Administrator with all
the necessary information related to the conditional use to render this
determination. If the Zoning Administrator determines that the proposed
modification or intensification will not alter the essential character or
operation of the conditional use, a new conditional use permit shall not be
required.
   N.    Validity of Conditional Use Permit Time Limit and Extension. 
Conditional Use Permits authorized by the City Council shall be void one (1)
year after the date upon which approval was granted unless any of the following
criteria is met:
      1.    In the case of new construction, work upon the structure shall have
begun above the foundation walls.
      2.    In the case of occupancy of land, the use has commenced.
      3.    In the case of reconstruction or modifications to a structure, a
Certificate of Occupancy has been granted.
      4.    If the time period is extended by a majority vote of the City
Council.
      5.    If the time period is extended by the Zoning Administrator pursuant
to Section
1212,06.B.7, Guarantee of Time Extensions.
   O.    Revocation of Conditional Use Permit. A conditional use permit may be
revoked if the established conditions for approval are violated. The Zoning
Administrator is responsible for advising the City Planning Commission of any
violations, and the City Planning Commission may then recommend to the City
Council that it revoke the conditional use permit.
(Ord. 13-16.  Enacted 5-28-13.)
1213.06 SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   A.    Purpose.  A site plan review of all new construction required by the
applicable district regulations and related site and landscape development is
required in order to further promote the safe and efficient use of land and to
further enhance the value of property in the City. The site plan review process

performing site plan review and granting site plan approval for all
modifications.
   C.    Parties Entitled to Seek Site Plan Review.  An application for site

Zoning Administrator, the Zoning Administrator shall schedule the application
for review at the  appropriate review body's meeting. If the review is within

schedule the application at the City Planning Commission's next scheduled
meeting. If the review is within the Authority of the Zoning Administrator,
then such review shall be scheduled in coordination with the Architectural
Board of Review schedule.
      4.    When the proposed development requires review by the Architectural
Board of Review, the site plan review will be approved by the City Planning
Commission in the case of new construction and by the Zoning Administrator in
the case of modifications.
      5.    When the proposed development requires review by the City Planning
Commission, the site plan shall first be reviewed by the Zoning Administrator.
      6.   No application for a building permit shall be issued by the City
until the site plan is approved by the reviewing authority.
   E.    Standards for Site Plan Review.  The City Planning Commission and
staff, when evaluating site plans, may review the following characteristics of

street parking, off-street loading, or accessways shall be landscaped or
otherwise improved.
   F.    Effect of Site Plan Review Approval. A building permit may be issued

requirements of all other applicable City codes and ordinances relating to the
issuance of a building permit are satisfied.
(Ord. 18-25.  Enacted 4-23-18.)

amendment should be granted or denied, the City Council or City Planning
Commission should be guided by the principle that its power to amend this
Zoning Ordinance is not an arbitrary one but one that may be exercised only
when the public good demands or requires the amendment to be made. In
considering whether that principle is satisfied in any particular case, the
City Council or the City Planning Commission should weigh, among other factors,
the following factors as they may be relevant to a particular application:

land use policies.
      2.    The consistency of the proposed amendment with the purposes of this
Zoning Ordinance.
      3.    If a specific parcel of property is the subject of the proposed
amendment, then the following factors:

the vicinity of the subject property
         b.    The trend of development in the vicinity of the subject
property, including changes, if any, in such trend since the subject property
was placed in its present zoning classification.
         c.    The extent, if any, to which the value of the subject property
is diminished by the existing zoning classification applicable to it.
         d.    The extent, if any, to which any such diminution in value is
offset by an increase in the public peace, health, safety, and welfare.
         e.    The extent, if any, to which the use and enjoyment of adjacent
properties would be affected by the proposed amendment.
         f.    The extent, if any, to which the value of adjacent properties
would be affected by the proposed amendment.
         g.    The extent, if any, to which the future orderly development of
adjacent properties would be affected by the proposed amendment.
         h.   The suitability of the subject property for uses permitted or
permissible under its present zoning classification.
         i.    The availability of adequate ingress to and egress from the
subject property and the extent to which traffic conditions in the immediate
vicinity of the subject property would be affected by the proposed amendment.

essential public services to the subject property to accommodate the uses
permitted or permissible under its present zoning classification.
   J.   Effect of Approval of Amendment.

1213.10 DESIGNATING LANDMARKS AND LANDMARK DISTRICTS.
   A.   DESIGNATION OF LANDMARKS
      1.    Application for Landmark Designation. The Landmark Commission may
apply to City Council to designate a place, building, structure, site, work of
art, or similar object in the City as a Landmark, or to designate any grouping
of such places or objects, or combination thereof, as a Landmark District, by
following the procedures set forth in this Section.  The Landmark Commission
may act on its own initiative to apply for such designation, or pursuant to a
request by an individual or organization.
      2.   Procedure for Designating Landmark Status. The Landmark Commission
may apply for the designation of a place, building, structure, site, work of
art, or similar object in the City as a Landmark or Landmark District by
adopting a resolution to recommend such designation to City Council.  After the
Landmark Commission adopts a resolution recommending the designation of a
Landmark or Landmark District, it shall follow the procedures set forth below:
         a.   In order to protect proposed Landmark properties or properties
located in a proposed Landmark District during the process for designation, the
Landmark Commission may request that City Council adopt a resolution approving
the referral, during the pendency of the designation process, of all
applications for permits for activity related to a proposed Landmark or in a
proposed Landmark District to the Landmark Commission for review.  If City
Council adopts such a resolution, all such permit applications pending as of
the effective date of the resolution and all permit applications submitted
after said effective date shall be referred to the Landmark Commission for
review, and the Landmark Commission shall have the same powers that would apply
if the proposed Landmark or Landmark District were an established Landmark or
District.  The referral and review of such permits shall continue for twelve
months after City Council adopts such a resolution, or until such time as City
Council approves or rejects the establishment of the Landmark or District by
ordinance, whichever occurs first.
         b.   The Landmark Commission shall notify the owner or owners of all
property included in the proposed designation within ten (10) days of the
adoption by the Landmark Commission of a resolution to apply for designation. 
The notice shall request the owner's comments.
         c.   The Landmark Commission shall seek the approval of the owner or
owners of all property included in the proposed designation.  However, approval
is not required in order for a property to be designated as a Landmark or as
being within a Landmark District.
         d.   The Landmark Commission shall prepare a report and recommendation
as to the property proposed to be designated as a Landmark or as within a
Landmark District, including an explanation of the significance of the property
or properties in relation to the designation criteria, a description of the
property or properties with a list of contributing and non-contributing
structures and sites, a history of the property or properties, photographic
documentation, and a map or site plan showing the boundaries of the proposed
Landmark or District.
         e.   The Landmark Commission shall submit the report and
recommendation to the Planning Commission and secure from said Commission a
recommendation with respect to the proposed designation, its opinion as to the
effect of the proposed designation upon the surrounding neighborhood, and its
opinion and recommendations as to any other planning consideration which may be
relevant to the proposed designation, together with its recommendation of
approval, rejection, or modification of the proposed designation.  Such
recommendation shall become part of the official record concerning the proposed
designation and shall be submitted by the Landmark Commission along with its
report concerning the proposed designation to City Council.  The Landmark
Commission may make such modifications, changes and alterations concerning the
proposed designation as it deems necessary in consideration of the
recommendation by the Planning Commission.
         f.   Within forty-five (45) days after receiving the Planning
Commission's recommendation, the Landmark Commission shall schedule a public
hearing on the proposed designation.
         g.   At least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the date of the
hearing, written notice setting forth the date, time, place and purpose of the
hearing shall be mailed to the owner(s) or any person(s) having a legal or
equitable interest in such property being proposed for designation.  The notice
shall indicate where the Landmark Commission's designation report is available
for review.
         h.   Notice shall be mailed a minimum of five (5) calendar days and no
more than ten (10) calendar days prior to the public hearing to all property
owners within three hundred (300) feet of the proposed Landmark or District and
to any organization that requests notice.
         i.   No less than four (4) days prior to the public hearing, the
Landmark Commission shall cause a legal notice to be published in a newspaper
of general circulation in the City setting forth the nature of the hearing, the
property involved, and the date, time and place of the scheduled public
hearing.
         j.   The Landmark Commission shall conduct the public hearing and
shall provide a reasonable opportunity for all interested parties to express
their opinions under such rules as the Landmark Commission may adopt for the
purpose of governing the proceedings of the hearings.  Each speaker shall be
fully identified as to name, address, and the interests that he or she
represents.
         k.   The Landmark Commission shall make a determination whether to
pursue without modification, modify or withdrawn the proposed designation in
writing within fifteen (15) days after the hearing and shall notify any owner
(s) or any person(s) having a legal or equitable interest in such property, as
well as such other interested parties as may request a copy thereof.  The
Landmark Commission shall transmit its report and recommendations concerning
the proposed designation to City Council.
         l.   City Council may, in its discretion, hold public hearings on any
proposed designation.  City Council shall, within ninety (90) days after
receiving the report and recommendation of the Landmark Commission, either
designate the Landmark or Landmark District by  ordinance or reject designation
by resolution.  In making its determination with respect to the proposed
designation, City Council shall give due consideration to the findings and
recommendations of the Landmark Commission, as well as such views as may have
been expressed by persons participating in the hearing before the Landmark
Commission, in addition to the recommendation of the Planning Commission.
      3.   Actions After a Designation.  Within seven (7) days after the
adoption of an ordinance by City Council approving the designation of a
Landmark or Landmark District, the Landmark Commission shall notify the City
Building Department of the designation.  The Landmark Commission shall also
file with the Recorder of Deeds of Cuyahoga County a certified copy of the
designating ordinance together with a notice briefly stating the fact of such
designation and a summary of the effects such designation will have.  The
Landmark Commission, further, shall send a copy of such ordinance and notice to
the owner(s) and any person having a right of ownership in such property
included within a designation.
      4.   Rescission of a Designation.  Notwithstanding any provision of this
Section to the contrary, City Council may rescind the designation of any area,
place, building, structure, site, work of art or similar object as a Landmark
or Landmark District by ordinance upon a finding that the designated Landmark
or Landmark District does not meet the designation criteria or to protect the
public interest in response to changed circumstances since the designation
decision was made.  Council may rescind designation after compliance with the
same procedures as are required to be followed by Council for a Zoning Code
amendment under Section
1213.07, and as set forth herein for designation, including referral for
comment and recommendation to the Landmark Commission and Planning Commission,
and after a public hearing is held before the Landmark Commission.  Council may
rescind a designation even if the Landmark or Planning Commission do not
recommend such action.  Passage of such an ordinance shall relieve the owner of
such property from any duties or penalties contained in this chapter.
      5.   Criteria for Designating a Landmark or a Landmark District.  In
determining whether or not to adopt a resolution recommending the designation
of an area, place, building, structure, site, work of art, or object as a
Landmark or Landmark District, the Landmark Commission shall determine whether
the proposed Landmark or Landmark District meets one or more of the following
criteria:
         a.   Its character, interest or value as part of the development,
heritage or cultural characteristics of the City of Shaker Heights, the State
of Ohio, or the United States.
         b.   Its location as a site of a significant historic event.
         c.   Its identification with a person or persons who significantly
contribute to the culture and development of the City.
         d.   Its exemplification of the cultural, economic, social or historic
heritage of the City.
         e.   Its portrayal of the environment of a group of people in an era
of history.
         f.   Its embodiment of a distinguishing characteristic of an
architectural type, specimen, style or method of construction.
         g.   Its identification as the work of an architect or master builder
whose individual work has influenced the development of the City.

materials or craftsmanship that represent a significant architectural
innovation.
         i.   Its relationship to other distinctive areas that are eligible for
preservation according to a plan based on history, culture, or architecture.
         j.   Its unique location or singular physical characteristic
representing an established and familiar visual feature of a neighborhood,
community or the City.
      6.   Recording Landmarks and Landmark Districts.  The Landmark Commission
shall maintain complete records of all properties designated as Landmarks. 
This designation shall also be noted in the Building Department records of the
City.
      7.   On-Site Identification of Landmarks or Landmark Districts.  The
Landmark Commission may place or cause to be placed on such Landmark properties
a plaque or other type of marker indicating that such property or part thereof
has been designated a Landmark or as part of a Landmark District in the City.
   B.   CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS; Approval Required for Any Exterior
Building or Environmental Change.  No person shall make any environmental or
exterior building change in any property which has been designated a Landmark
or which is situated in a designated Landmark District without first obtaining
a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Landmark Commission. The following
procedures shall apply to all alterations, demolitions, removals or
constructions of such property in the City:
      1.   Application for Review of Changes. Any application to the Landmark
Commission, Building Department or to the Planning Department, as appropriate,
for a permit for or approval of an environmental or exterior building change,
including a demolition, must include detailed plans, designs, elevations,
specifications and documents relating thereto, as required by the Director of
the Department to which the application is submitted. Any such completed
application submitted to the Building Department or Planning Department shall
be forwarded to the Landmark Commission. The Building Department shall not
issue a building or demolition permit for, and the Planning Department shall
not give approval of, an environmental or exterior building change until the
Landmark Commission has issued a Certificate of Appropriateness.  The applicant
may file an application directly with the Landmark Commission at the same time
that an application for a building permit or approval is filed. The Landmark
Commission may charge a reasonable fee, as approved by Council, to review an
application.
      2.   Standards For Review of Applications. When considering an
application for a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Landmark Commission shall
be guided in its decision by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior's "Standards
for Rehabilitation", as found in Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations,
Part 1208 (formerly 36 CFR Part 67). In addition, the Landmark Commission may
adopt more specific design guidelines suited to the historic character of
Landmarks and Landmark Districts. In reviewing an application for demolition,
the Landmark Commission shall consider the following in addition to the
"Standards for Rehabilitation" cited above:
         a.   The historic significance of the structure individually or as a
contributing element in a district.
         b.   Plans for reuse of the site, which the applicant must submit,
including project funding and schedule, and the impact of such plans on the
Landmark or Landmark District.
      3.   Approval of Minor Changes. The Landmark Commission may delegate to
its staff the authority to issue Certificates of Appropriateness for specified
minor changes.  The Landmark Commission shall provide to staff written
guidelines for issuing Certificates of Appropriateness under this subsection.
      4.   Parties Entitled to Apply for Landmark Commission Review of Changes.
An application for an environmental or exterior building change may be filed by
any person, firm or corporation, or by any office, department, board, bureau,
or commission which has a legal interest in the property in the form of an
ownership interest, a lease, or a purchase agreement for the property for which
the review of changes is requested.  If the applicant is a lessor, the written
approval, with signature, of the owner shall be required as determined
necessary by the department to which the application is submitted.
      5.   Conditions for Approval for Review of Changes. The Landmark
Commission shall grant an application or approve an application with conditions
when it finds that the proposed change will not adversely affect any
significant historical or aesthetic feature of the property and is appropriate
and consistent with the spirit and purposes of this Chapter, any design
guidelines adopted by the Landmark Commission, and the U.S. Secretary of the
Interior's "Standards for Rehabilitation".  Otherwise, the Landmark Commission
shall deny the application.
      6.   Landmark Commission Notice to Building Department. Within ten (10)
days of making a determination on an application, the Landmark Commission shall
transmit written notices of its decision to the applicant and the Building
Department.  The notices shall state the reasons for the decision.
      7.   Denial of Certificate Application. If an application has been
denied, the Landmark Commission shall recommend to the applicant changes, if
any, that would allow the Landmark Commission to issue a Certificate of
Appropriateness.  The Landmark Commission shall confer with the applicant in an
attempt to resolve any differences as quickly as possible.  The applicant may
resubmit an amended application that takes into consideration the Landmark
Commission's recommendations.
      8.   Failure of Landmark Commission to Act in a Timely Manner.  If no
action has been taken by the Landmark Commission on a complete application
within sixty (60) days after such complete application has been received by the
Landmark Commission, the application shall be deemed granted, unless the time
for consideration is extended by mutual agreement.
      9.   Applicability of Other Ordinances, Rules and Regulations.  Nothing
contained herein shall eliminate the need for compliance by the owner, occupant
or party in control of such property with all other applicable ordinances,
rules and regulations of the City.
      10.   Architectural Board of Review.  When an application for a building
or environmental change requires review by both the Landmark Commission and the
Architectural Board of Review, the Architectural Board of Review will meet
jointly with the Landmark Commission.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Chapter, only architectural design compatible with historical buildings in
approved Landmark Districts in the City shall be approved for any new
construction by the Architectural Board of Review in Landmark Districts.
   C.   ECONOMIC HARDSHIP; Application Filed After Denial of Certificate of
Appropriateness.
      1.   Application for certificate of Economic Hardship; Criteria.  An
applicant who has been denied a Certificate of Appropriateness may, within
thirty (30) days of the denial, apply for a Certificate of Economic Hardship. 
Application shall be made on a form prepared by the Landmark Commission.  The
Landmark Commission may hold a public hearing on the hardship application.  All
of the following criteria shall be considered to determine the existence of an
economic hardship:
         a.   Denial of a certificate will result in a substantial reduction in
the economic value of the property;
         b.   Denial of a certificate will result in a substantial economic
burden on the applicant because the applicant cannot reasonably maintain the
property in its current form;
         c.   No reasonable alternative exists consistent with the
architectural standards and guidelines for the property;
         d.   The owner has been unable to sell the property; or
         e.   If the owner is a not-for-profit organization, and it is
financially or physically infeasible to achieve its charitable purpose while
conforming to the pertinent architectural standards and guidelines.
      2.   Certificate Process.  The Landmark Commission may solicit expert
testimony or request that the applicant for a Certificate of Economic Hardship
submit evidence concerning property value, cost estimates, income, expenses,
and/or any other information that the Landmark Commission deems necessary to
determine whether denial of the application constitutes an economic hardship. 
The level of documentation required may vary as is appropriate to each case. 
The Applicant may submit any person or proprietary information to the Staff of
the City for a confidential review, and such information shall be returned to
the Applicant, and a summary or evaluation of the information shall be provided
to the Landmark Commission without disclosure of the specific personal or
proprietary information.
      3.   Landmark Commission Action on an Application.  The Landmark
Commission shall act upon the application for Certificate of Economic Hardship
within sixty (60) days after receipt of such an application.  If no action has
taken by the Landmark Commission within sixty (60) days, the application shall
be deemed granted, unless the time is extended by mutual agreement.  Upon the
denial of an application, the applicant shall be notified by mail.
      4.   Investigation of Measures to Relieve Hardship.  Upon a finding by
the Landmark Commission that a denial of the application for building or
environmental change results in a hardship, then the application for a
Certificate of Appropriateness shall be delayed for a period not to exceed
ninety (90) days.  During this period the Landmark Commission shall investigate
measures to relieve the hardship or otherwise preserve the property, and shall
make recommendations to the Mayor or Council as may be appropriate.  Such plans
and recommendations may include, but are not limited to: a reduction in real
property taxes, financial assistance, Building Code modifications, and/or
changes in zoning regulations, to the extent such actions may be lawful.
      5.   Issuance of Certificate.  If by the end of this ninety (90) day
period, the Landmark Commission has found that without approval of the building
or environmental change the hardship cannot be relieved, then the Landmark
Commission shall issue a Certificate of Economic Hardship permitting the
proposed building or environmental change.
   D.    EXCEPTIONS, APPEALS, MORATORIUM AND ENFORCEMENT. All work performed
pursuant to a Certificate of Appropriateness issued under this Chapter shall
conform to any requirements included in the approval of the Certificate.  It
shall be the duty of the Commissioner of Building, with the assistance from the
Department of Planning, to inspect periodically any such work to assure
compliance.  In the event work is found that is not being performed in
accordance with the Certificate of Appropriateness, or upon notification of
such fact by the Landmark Commission, the Commissioner of Building shall issue
a stop work order and all work shall immediately cease.  No further work shall
be undertaken on the project as long as a stop work order is in effect.
      1.   Changes Not Prohibited. Nothing in this Section shall be construed
to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural
feature of any property which has been designated a Landmark or which is
situated in a designated Landmark District that does not involve a change in
design, material, color or exterior appearance thereof, nor to prevent any
environmental or exterior building change that the Building, Fire, Housing
Inspection or Health Departments shall certify in writing is immediately
required by the public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition.  If
the Building, Fire, Housing Inspection or Health Department orders an immediate
environmental or exterior building change, it shall notify the Landmark
Commission of the proposed change.  The Landmark Commission shall have the
right to seek to have the measure least adverse to the purposes of this Chapter
used to make the necessary change.
      2.   Appeals. An applicant may appeal a final decision of the Landmark
Commission on an Application for a Certificate of Appropriateness or
Certificate of Economic Hardship within thirty (30) days of the decision, by
filing a notice of appeal with the Board of Zoning Appeals.  The Board shall
hold a hearing on an appeal within forty-five (45) days after receipt of a
notice, and shall issue a decision on an appeal within fourteen (14) days after
a hearing.
      3.   Emergency Moratorium. If City Council determines that a proposed
exterior building or environmental change will cause irreparable harm to
structures or sites located within a designated or potential Landmark or
Landmark District, City Council may by resolution declare an emergency
moratorium on all work for a period not to exceed six (6) months.  During the
moratorium period, the City shall investigate ways to remove the threat,
including but not limited to negotiation, marketing, or financial assistance. 
Council may extend the emergency moratorium for an additional period not to
exceed six (6) months upon finding that the threat of irreparable harm is still
present.  Any pending Permit application concerning a structure or site subject
to an emergency moratorium may be summarily denied.
      4.   Power to Seek Injunction. The Landmark Commission or the Mayor may
ask the Director of Law to take whatever legal action may be necessary,
including the filing of a complaint in injunction and requesting of a temporary
restraining order and preliminary injunction, to prevent a proposed exterior
building or environmental change that may cause irreparable harm to structures
or sites located within a designated or potential Landmark or Landmark
District, until City Council has a reasonable opportunity to consider a
resolution declaring an emergency moratorium on all work that may have such
damaging effect.
      5.   Violations. Any person who violates or fails to comply with any
provision of this Section shall, for each violation or noncompliance, be deemed
guilty of a minor misdemeanor and penalized as set forth in Section 2929.28 of
the Ohio Revised Code.  Each day of violation or failure to comply shall
constitute a separate offense.
   E.   SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this Section shall be deemed severable,
and if any such provision shall be held unconstitutional by a court of
competent jurisdiction the decision of such court shall not impair any of the
remaining provisions.
(Ord. 18-25.  Enacted 4-23-18.)
 
1213.11 ADMINISTRATIVE INTERPRETATIONS.
   A.    Authority.  The Zoning Administrator, subject to the procedures,
standards, and limitations of this Chapter, may, in writing, render
interpretations, including use interpretations, of the provisions of this
Zoning Ordinance and of any rule or regulation issued pursuant to it.
   B.    Purpose.  The interpretation authority established by this Chapter is
intended to recognize that the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, though
detailed and extensive, cannot, as a practical matter, address every specific
situation to which they may have to be applied. Many such situations can be
readily addressed by an administrative interpretation of the specific
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance in light of the general and specific
purposes for which those provisions have been enacted. Because the
interpretation authority established is an administrative rather than a
legislative authority, it is not intended to add to or change the essential
content of this Zoning Ordinance but is intended only to allow authoritative
application of that content to specific cases.
   C.    Parties Entitled to Seek Interpretations.  Applications for
interpretations may be filed by any person having a legal interest in property,
such as a title, lease, or purchase agreement, in property that gives rise to
the need for an interpretation provided that interpretations shall not be
sought by any person based solely on hypothetical circumstances or where the
interpretation would have no effect other than as an advisory opinion. The
Zoning Administrator may elect not to render an interpretation on a matter
which, in the Zoning Administrator’s opinion, is based on hypothesis.
   
   D.    Procedure.
      1.    Application.  Applications for interpretations of this Zoning
Ordinance shall be filed in writing by letter and shall contain information
describing the nature of the requested interpretation and written evidence of
the applicant’s interest in the property. The Zoning Administrator may request
any additional information necessary to make the interpretation.
      2.    Action on Application.  Within a reasonable time following the
receipt of a properly completed application for interpretation, the Zoning
Administrator shall inform the applicant in writing of his or her
interpretation, stating the specific precedent, reasons, and analysis upon
which the determination is based.
      3.    Record.  A record of all applications for interpretations shall be
kept on file in the office of the Zoning Administrator.
      4.    Appeal.  The Board of Zoning Appeals shall, pursuant to Section
1213.02, Appeals, of this Zoning Ordinance, hear and decide appeals from any
order or final decision of the Zoning Administrator acting pursuant to his or
her authority and duties under this Zoning Ordinance. Except as expressly
provided otherwise, an application for appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals
may be filed not later than forty-five (45) calendar days following the action
being appealed.
   E.    Standards for Use Interpretations.  The following standards shall be
factors considered by the Zoning Administrator and the City Planning Commission
in issuing use interpretations:
      1.    Any use defined in Chapter
1211, Definitions and Rules of Word Usage, of this Zoning Ordinance shall be
interpreted as therein defined.
      2.    Evidence must demonstrate that the use will comply with the
district regulations established for that particular district.
      3.    A use must be substantially similar to other uses permitted in the
particular district and more similar to those uses than to uses permitted or
conditionally permitted in a more restrictive district.
      4.    If the proposed use is most similar to a use permitted only as a
conditional use in the district in which it is proposed, then any use
interpretation shall require the issuance of a Conditional Use Permit for such
use pursuant to Section
1213.05, Conditional Uses.
      5.    No use interpretation shall permit the establishment of any use
that would be inconsistent with the statement of purpose of the district in
question.
   F.    Effect of Favorable Use Interpretations.  No use interpretation which
finds a particular use to be permitted or specially permitted in a particular
district shall authorize the establishment of such use nor the development,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or
structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing
of applications for any permits and approvals that may be required by the codes
and ordinances of the City including, but not limited to, a building permit, a
certificate of occupancy, subdivision approval, and site plan approval.
   G.    Limitations on Use Interpretations.  A use interpretation which finds
a particular use to be permitted, or permitted as a conditional use, shall
authorize only the use for which it was issued, and that interpretation shall
not authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate use interpretation
has not been issued.

   The Zoning Administrator or designee may make inspections of all buildings,
structures  and premises located within the City to determine their compliance
with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.

not limited to the observations of the Zoning Administrator or designee
information brought to the attention of the Zoning Administrator or designee,
or any complaint received by the Zoning Administrator or designee pursuant to
Section
1214.02, or if such inspection is undertaken as part of a regular inspection
program whereby certain areas of the City are being inspected in their
entirety.
   B.    Such inspection shall be made by the Zoning Administrator or his or
her designee.
   C.    Any person making such inspection shall furnish to the owner or
occupant of the building, structure or premise to be inspected, sufficient
identification and information to enable the owner or occupant to determine
that the person is a representative of the City and the purpose of the
inspection. The Zoning Administrator or his or her designee may apply to any
court of competent jurisdiction for a search warrant or other legal process for
the purpose of securing entry to any premises if the owner or occupant shall
refuse to grant entry.
1214.04 PROCEDURES UPON DISCOVERY OF VIOLATIONS.
   A.    If the Zoning Administrator finds that any provision of this Zoning
Ordinance is being violated, the Administrator shall send a written notice to
the person responsible for such violation indicating the nature of the
violation, ordering the action necessary to correct the violation, and
specifying a reasonable amount of time for the correction of the violation or
the performance of any other act required. Additional written notices may be
sent at the Administrator’s discretion.
   B.    The Administrator’s notice shall be served upon the owner or the
owner’s agent or the occupant, as the case may require, provided that such
notice shall be deemed to be properly served upon such owner or agent, or upon
such occupant, if a copy thereof: 1) is served personally, or 2) is sent to the
last known address, or 3) is posted in a conspicuous place in or about the
building, structure or premises affected by the action.
   C.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, in cases when delay would seriously
threaten the effective enforcement; of this Zoning Ordinance or pose a danger
to the public peace, health, safety, or welfare, the Zoning Administrator may
seek enforcement; without prior written notice.
1214.05 PENALTIES AND REMEDIES FOR VIOLATIONS.
   A.    Violations of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance or failure to
comply with any of its requirements, including violations of any conditions and
safeguards established in connection
with approval of a variance, conditional use, site plan review, or development
approval, shall constitute a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   
   B.    Each day that any violation continues after notification by the Zoning
Administrator that such violation exists shall be considered a separate
offense.
   C.    In addition to any other remedies provided by this Zoning Ordinance,
or by the laws of the State of Ohio, the Law Director of the City may, upon a
violation of this Zoning Ordinance
having been called to his or her attention, institute injunction, mandamus,
abatement or any other appropriate action to prevent, enjoin, abate or remove
any unlawful construction, reconstruction, alterations, conversion, maintenance
or use.
1214.06 REVOCATION OF CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS AND VARIANCES.
   A Conditional Use Permit or Variance may be revoked by the Board of Zoning
Appeals, or City Planning Commission as appropriate, in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, if the recipient of the Conditional Use Permit or
the Variance fails to develop or maintain the property in accordance with the
plans submitted, the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, or any additional
requirements lawfully imposed as a condition of approval of a conditional use
or variance. Before a Conditional Use Permit or Variance can be revoked, the
Zoning Administrator shall undertake the following procedures:
   A.    Notice and Opportunity to Comment.  The Zoning Administrator shall

revoke the conditional use or variance shall inform the recipient of the
alleged reasons for the revocation and of his or her right to obtain a hearing
on the allegations.
   B.    Hearing.  If the property owner desires a hearing, the Zoning
Administrator shall schedule a date on the Board of Zoning Appeal’s or City
Planning Commission’s agenda to hear the revocation.
   C.    Decision Rendered.  If the revocation was subject to a public hearing,
the Board of Zoning Appeals or  City Planning Commission shall render a
decision upon the proposed revocation within a reasonable time of such hearing.
Such decision shall be rendered by written order containing the specific
reasons or findings of fact that support the decision.
   D.    Notification of Decision.  The Zoning Administrator shall send such
decision within five (5) working days to the holder of the Conditional Use
Permit or Variance and any other person previously requesting notification.
   E.    Evidence.  The burden of presenting sufficient evidence to the Zoning

the reasons set forth in this Section shall be upon the party proposing the
revocation.

1215.01 EXISTING NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND USES.
   Any use of land or building, any design of building, any location of
building on the lot and any platted lot which lawfully existed on the effective
date of this Zoning Ordinance may be continued even though such use, design or
location does not conform to the regulations of this Zoning Ordinance for the
district in which such use is located. However, no enlargement or expansion of
such nonconforming building or use shall be made, except for two-family units
and duplexes to which additions may be made subject to all the other review
requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.
1215.02 BUILDINGS UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
   No change is required by this Zoning Ordinance in the plans, construction or
designated uses of a building which does not conform to the regulations of this
Zoning Ordinance for the district in which its premises are located, provided
the permit for such building was issued and construction on it was begun before
the passage of this Zoning Ordinance and completed within eighteen (18) months
of the issuance of such permit in accordance with the plans and descriptions on
which said permit was issued. For the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance such
construction shall be deemed an existing nonconforming use.
1215.03 CHANGES IN A NONCONFORMING USE.
   A.    Changes of Use Restricted.
      1.    Changes to a Less Restricted Use Prohibited.  No change of a
nonconforming use shall be made to a less restricted use.
      2.    Changes to a More Restricted Use.  A nonconforming use may be
changed to any use permitted in this Zoning Ordinance in a more restrictive
district provided no structural changes are made. Such use would remain a
nonconforming use unless the use is permitted in the district in which it is
located.
      3.    Changes to a Use of Similar Nonconformity.  Any change of a
nonconforming use to a use of the same degree of nonconformity, as defined in
Chapter
1211, Definitions and Rules of Word Usage, shall be made only upon approval of
the Board of Zoning Appeals and only if the Board finds that the proposed use
is not more injurious to neighborhood property values than the existing use.
   B.    Changes to a Nonconforming Structure.  No significant structural
changes shall be made to a nonconforming structure unless it is changed to
bring the structure and use into conformity or unless the change is
specifically approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Such changes, additions
and/or improvements shall upgrade the activity and make the resulting
development more compatible to the district in which it is located and more
compatible with adjacent uses. Such expansion or addition shall require a total
Site Plan Review for the entire parcel.
1215.04 ABANDONMENT OF NONCONFORMING USES.
   A nonconforming use which has been abandoned shall not be replaced by a
nonconforming use.
   A.    Abandonment of a Nonconforming Use of Land Other than Structures.  A
nonconforming use of land shall be deemed abandoned when the nonconforming use
has been replaced by a conforming use or when the nonconforming use has ceased
and has not been resumed for a continuous period of one (1) year.
   B.    Abandonment of a Nonconforming Use or Structure.
      1.    Standard.  A nonconforming use of structure shall be deemed
abandoned when it has been replaced by a conforming use or when the
nonconforming use has ceased for a continuous period of one (1) year.
      2.    Third Floor Occupancy of Two-Family Dwelling.  A nonconforming use
of a third-floor area in a two-family dwelling shall be conclusively deemed
abandoned upon the failure of the owner or agent of such dwelling to file the
Annual Registration required by Section
1413.01 of the Housing Code for a continuous period of one (1) year, or upon
the discontinuance of the use for a period of one (1) year.
1215.05 RESTORATIONS, ALTERATIONS AND REPAIRS.
   A non-conforming structure may be restored regardless of other regulations
in this Zoning Ordinance subject to the following limitations enumerated below.
   A.    Structure Declared Unsafe.  The structure has been declared unsafe by
the Commissioner of Buildings or other authorized administrative official.
   B.    Structure Damaged or Destroyed.  At least sixty percent (60%) of the
structure, according to the determination of the Building Commissioner, has
been partly destroyed or removed by whatever cause including Acts of God, with
the exception that single-family, two-family and duplex dwellings may be
restored for such use in accordance with this Zoning Ordinance without
limitation as to cost.

1234.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this district is to encourage a compact mix of retail, 
service, office, housing and public activities to coexist in a manner that
reflects human scale and emphasizes pedestrian orientation, taking advantage of
the convenience provided by multi-modal transportation options and the vitality
that mixed uses can bring to a community. CM Commercial Mixed Use Districts
("CM Districts") can serve both local and regional commercial needs, while
reflecting the scale and character of Shaker Heights in a manner which protects
adjacent areas from any adverse effects.
   The regulations for this district are intended to create areas of 
concentrated development around key transit stops in order to:
   A.   Create dense, walkable, mixed-use centers wherein daily goods and
services and employment opportunities are located within walking distances of
residents.
   B.   Improve the pedestrian environment through building orientation,
attractive building facades, and pedestrian amenities. 
   C.   Expand residential and lifestyle options with increased mobility
choices.
   D.   Enhance the overall quality of life of Shaker Heights' residents,
businesses and visitors by creating great places.
   E.   Take advantage of the benefits of transit, including the value that
transit services add to adjacent and surrounding real estate, and increase the
physical and cultural prominence of transit in the community.
   G.   Ensure that new development or redevelopment occurs in a unified manner
consistent with transit-oriented development (TOD) plan(s) adopted by the City.

1242.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) Overlay District is  to
encourage and accommodate, in a unified project, creative and imaginative
infill developments that utilize innovations in land development that are in
the best interests of and consistent with the City's development and planning
policies and which would not otherwise be permitted in the conventional
residential or commercial districts pursuant to this Zoning Ordinance. The
regulations for PUDs are intended to achieve the following objectives:
   A.   To encourage creative approaches to the use of land and related
physical facilities that result in better urban design, higher quality
construction and the provision of aesthetic amenities.
   B.   To promote the efficient use of land, so as to promote economies in the
provision of utilities, streets, schools, public grounds and buildings, and
other facilities.
   C.   To permit flexibility of design that will create desirable public and
private common open spaces while maximizing the development potential of
individual sites.
   D.   To enhance the appearance of neighborhoods by conserving areas of
natural beauty and natural green spaces.
   E.   To provide substantial buffers and transitions between areas of
different land use and development densities.
      (Ord. 13-16.  Passed 5-28-13.)
1242.02 DESIGNATION OF PUD OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   An Overlay District is a mapped zone that establishes a development option
with a set of design requirements that are in addition to those of the
conventional "base"  residential or commercial zoning district, so that any
parcel of land lying in a PUD Overlay District shall also lie in one or more
conventional residential or commercial district. The PUD Overlay District gives
property owners the choice of developing according to the conventional "base"
district regulations or the PUD regulations.
   A.   Location Of District.
      1.   The location of the PUD Overlay District is limited to land fronting
the following major streets.
         a.    Chagrin Boulevard.
         b.    Lee Road.
         c.    Van Aken Boulevard.
         d.    Warrensville Center Road.
         e.    Green Road.
         f.    Shaker Boulevard.
         g.    Fairmount Boulevard.
         h.   Farnsleigh Road from Warrensville Center Road to Chagrin 
Boulevard.
      2.   These major streets are highlighted in Figure
1242.02, Allowable Locations for PD Overlay District.

IMAGES/0-0-0-5500.jpg]
   B.   PUD as a Conditional Use.
      1.   PUDs designed according to this Chapter shall be permitted as a
conditional use. The availability of the PUD option imposes no obligation on a
property owner to select the PUD form of development.  The decision to approve
a PUD application shall be at the sole discretion of the City.
      2.   Conditional Uses are those uses having some special impact or
uniqueness that requires a careful review of their location, design,
configuration, and special impact to determine the desirability of permitting
their establishment on any given site. Permits for Conditional Uses may be
granted pursuant to the requirements of Section
1213.05, Conditional Uses. General standards for conditional use permits are
found in Section
 1213.05 H, Standards for Conditional Use Permits. Standards for specific
conditional uses may be found in Chapter
1263, Conditional Uses, or elsewhere as referenced herein.
   C.   Relationship to Base Districts.
      1.     In the PUD Overlay District, the use and dimensional
specifications of the base zoning district are herein replaced by an approval
process in which an approved plan becomes the basis for continuing land use
controls. 
      2.    The base zoning district shall be used as a guide for development,
with any adjustment relative to use, density and building layout reviewed and
approved through the PUD review process set forth in Section
1213.09.
      3.   In the event a proposed PUD is located in more than one base zone,
the use limitations of the most intense base zone shall be used as the guide
for the entire project.
   D.   Limitations on Flexibility of PUDs.   The City Planning Commission
shall only approve PUDs that are consistent with the objectives set forth in
Section
1242.01. Therefore, the City Planning Commission may require as a condition of
approval any reasonable condition, limitation or design factor which will
promote proper development of a PUD.
      (Ord. 18-25.  Enacted 4-23-18.)
1242.03 PROJECT AREA.
   A.   The minimum project area for a PUD shall be one contiguous acre  with a
minimum of 200 feet of frontage on a street listed in Section
1242.02 A., unless specifically permitted otherwise.
   B.   When the proposed PUD is located adjacent to an existing multi-family,
commercial or special district, the City Planning Commission may approve a PUD
on less than one contiguous acre when the City Planning Commission determines
that:
      1.   Land ownership cannot be readily consolidated to reach the one acre
minimum project size; or
      2.   The project will not result in isolated development; or
      3.   The project will not have any unreasonable or adverse impacts on
adjacent areas.
   C.   The proposed project area shall be in one ownership, or if there are
two (2) or more owners, the application shall be filed jointly by all owners of
the properties included in the proposed PUD boundaries.  (Ord. 13-16.  Passed
5-28-13.)
1242.04 USES.
   A.   Principal Uses Permitted in a PUD.  In keeping with the desire for
flexibility in this district, the following may be permitted as -principal uses
in the PUD Overlay District:
      1.   Uses listed as permitted in the base zoning district. In the case of
a lot located in more than one base zoning district, the use limitations of the
most intense base zoning district shall prevail.
      2.   Dwelling units, single-family residence attached.
      3.   Mixed-use development where the base zoning permits non-residential
uses.
      4.   Uses listed as conditional in the base zoning district. In the case
of a lot located in more than one base zoning district, the use limitations of
the most intense base zoning district shall prevail.
      5.   Additional uses may be authorized as part of a PUD, provided that
the City Planning Commission finds: 
         a.   That the additional uses are necessary or desirable and are
appropriate with respect to the primary purpose and character of the PUD.
         b.   That the additional uses will not create a detrimental influence
on the neighborhoods surrounding the PUD, or upon the internal character of any
part of or all of the PUD itself.
   B.   Accessory Uses and Structures.  Uses listed as accessory in the base
zoning district shall also be permitted in a proposed PUD. In the case of a
proposed PUD located in more than one base zoning district, the accessory use
limitations of the most intense base zoning district shall prevail.    (Ord.
13-16.  Passed 5-28-13.)
1242.05 MAXIMUM DENSITY FOR RESIDENTIAL PUDS
   A.   The gross residential density of a PUD shall not be greater than that
set forth below:
 
Base Zoning District           Maximum Density
SF 1 Single-Family Residential 5 units per acre
SF 2 Single-Family Residential 7 units per acre
SF 3 Single-Family Residential 10 units per acre
TF Two-Family Residential      14 units per acre
All other base districts       As specified in the base district regulations
   B.   The City Planning Commission may establish a lower maximum density for
the proposed development when it finds that the PUD, at the density permitted
in subsection
1242.05 A. will adversely impact the character of the immediate residential
area when considering any one or more of the following:
      1.   The unusual size and shape of the PUD parcel.
      2.   The topography and other natural limitations of the PUD such as
streams, ravines, etc.
      3.    The reduced buildable area within the PUD because of items number
1. and 2. above.
      4.   The proximity of adjacent buildings and/or structures.
      5.   The actual lot sizes of the immediate residential area.
   C.   The City Planning Commission may permit greater density for a  PUD
under the following specific situations:
      1.   The PUD is located adjacent to an existing multi-family district,
commercial district or special district; and
      2.   The Planning Commission determines that the increase in density:
         a.   Is warranted to assure the economically feasible development of
the project, for economical development or redevelopment, when non-residential
development is contrary to the City's planning policies; and
         b.   Will have no material adverse impact on the adjacent properties
compared to other reasonable uses that might be contemplated for the property.
(Ord. 13-16.  Passed 5-28-13.)
1242.06 LOT REQUIREMENTS.
   A.   Dwelling units are not required to be on individual, subdivided lots.
   B.   There is no minimum lot size or lot width requirement for lots on
subdivided lots.

   A.   A landscaped buffer shall be provided along the perimeter of the PUD,
pursuant to Section
1253.09, Landscape Buffers and Screening, if either of the following applies as
determined by the Zoning Administrator:
      1.   Topography, installed screening or other barriers do not provide
adequate privacy for the PUD and for existing uses adjacent to the development.
      2.   Nonresidential uses or structures in the PUD abut a residential
district.
   B.   The width of the buffer shall be at least ten (10) feet, unless the
Planning Commission finds that a lesser distance, combined with landscaping
and/or other screening mechanisms are sufficient to ensure adequate privacy.
(Ord. 13-16.  Passed 5-28-13.)
1242.08 DESIGNATION OF PERMANENT OPEN SPACE. 
   A.   A PUD shall provide a minimum of 10% of the area of the PUD as
permanent public or private landscaped open space or other common open space.

the property in proportion to the uses assigned to the PUD and shall be located
in relation to those uses.
(Ord. 13-16.  Passed 5-28-13.)
1242.09 OTHER DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   The development standards of the base zoning district that are not
specifically addressed in this Chapter shall be used as a guide for determining
the appropriate building layout, building height and other development
requirements of the PUD.  In approving a PUD layout, the City Planning
Commission shall find that the proposed site plan is no less beneficial to the
tenants or occupants of such development, as well as the neighboring property,
than would be obtained under the yard requirements of this Zoning Ordinance for
buildings developed on separate zoning lots.
(Ord. 13-16.  Passed 5-28-13.)
1242.10 STANDARDS FOR REVIEW OF PUD APPLICATIONS.
   A.   Conditional Use Permit Standards. No PUD  shall be approved pursuant to

1243.01 PURPOSE.
   These regulations are established to provide for the construction and use of
Wireless Telecommunication Facilities in the City. The regulations allow
Wireless Telecommunication Facilities as a conditional use, or permitted
accessory use depending upon the specific land areas of the City in which, and
circumstances under which, they are proposed to be located. The purpose of
these regulations is to balance the competing interests created by the federal
Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104, codified at 47 U.S.C. §§
151 et seq.), the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation and
Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic
Buildings, and the interests of the City in regulating Wireless
Telecommunication Facilities for the following reasons:
   A.    To protect property values and provide for orderly development within
the City;
   B.    To insure that adequate telecommunication services are available
within the City;
   C.    To protect the visual character for residents and wireless users of
the City, including, but not limited to, its unique residential character,
unobstructed open spaces, attractive commercial/office areas, and trees and
other vegetation;
   D.    To maintain the historic character of the City, as recognized by its
inclusion on the National Registry of Historic Places, from the potential for
visual blight caused by Towers and related facilities,
   E.   To protect residential properties, parks, open spaces and the
nonintensive, mainly low-rise commercial zoning districts which are
characteristic of the City from the potential adverse effects of Towers and
related Facilities;
   F.    To promote Co-location of Wireless Telecommunications Facilities in
order to minimize the potential adverse effects of additional single-provider
Towers in the City;
   G.    To provide for and protect the health, safety and general welfare of
the residents and visitors of the City; and
   H.    To maintain, where possible, the integrity of the existing zoning
regulations contained in the Zoning Ordinance.
   The regulations identify acceptable land areas for the location of Wireless
Telecommunication Facilities as a conditional use in an overlay zoning district
(“Wireless Telecommunication Facilities Overlay District” or “WTFO District”),
or as a permitted accessory use when colocating for erection of Antennas only,
which determination is dependent upon the location and characteristics of such
land areas and the structures involved.
   Where applicable, the regulations governing the Wireless Telecommunications
Facilities Overlay District shall control and supersede wherever they are
inconsistent with other provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. If no inconsistency
exists between the provisions of this WTFO District and the provisions of the
underlying zoning district, the underlying zoning district regulations and
other provisions of this Zoning Ordinance shall remain in full force and effect
and shall regulate all land use and development.

family detached and attached units at a similar density to the underlying
district and to allow for the subdivision of land to accommodate such units on
small lots.
   C.   Spark innovative design in new housing construction.
   D.   Allow flexibility in housing type through reduced lot size, setbacks,
street frontage, lot coverage, and vehicle access requirements to facilitate
infill development.
   E.   Provide development and design standards and guidelines to promote
compatibility between existing and new development and enhance the
marketability of the entire block.
   F.   Establish a review process for small lot infill development as a
planned development that considers the subdivision of land into small lots
simultaneously with the design of the proposed housing on such lots to ensure
neighborhood compatibility of the Small Lot Infill Development.
   G.   Encourage transit oriented development.
      (Ord. 18-25.  Enacted 4-23-18.)
1244.02  DESIGNATION OF SLID OVERLAY DISTRICT. 
   An Overlay District is a mapped zone that establishes a development option
with a set of design requirements that are in addition to and in some cases an
exception to those of the conventional "base" residential zoning district, so
that any parcel of land lying in a SLID Overlay District shall also lie in one
or more conventional residential district. The SLID Overlay District gives
property owners the choice of developing according to the conventional "base"
district regulations or the SLID regulations.
   A.   Location of SLID Overlay District.  The City Planning Commission and
City Council may, through the zoning amendment procedures in Section
1213.07, approve a SLID Overlay District for a residential neighborhood where
infill housing is to be encouraged. Areas where a SLID Overlay District has
been established are described below:
      1.   The location of the South Moreland SLID Overlay District is limited
to the TF District designated on Figure
1244.02.A.1.

IMAGES/0-0-0-5116.gif]
   B.   SLID as a Conditional Use. Once a SLID Overlay District is established,
Small Lot Infill Development (SLID) shall be regulated as a conditional use.
      1.   The availability of the SLID option imposes no obligation on a
property owner to select the SLID form of development. The decision to approve
a SLID application shall be at the sole discretion of the City Planning
Commission and City Council.
      2.   Approval of a SLID is granted pursuant to the requirements of
Section
1213.05, Conditional Uses. General standards for conditional use permits are
found in Section
 1213.05 H, Standards for Conditional Use Permits. 
   C.   Relationship to Base Districts.
      1.   In the SLID Overlay District, the use and dimensional specifications
of the base zoning district are herein replaced by an approval process in which
an approved infill development plan becomes the basis for continuing land use
controls.
      2.   The base zoning district shall be used as a guide for development,
with any adjustment relative to use, density and building layout reviewed and
approved through application of standards and design guidelines set forth in
this Chapter and the review process for planned developments set forth in
Section
 1213.09. 
   D.   Relationship to Other Development Standards.
      1.   All of the provisions of the Shaker Heights Zoning Code that are
applicable to the underlying district shall apply to SLID projects except as
specifically modified in this Chapter.
      2.   To the extent that these regulations conflict with design standards
in the Subdivision Regulations, these regulations shall apply. 
   E.   Limitations on Flexibility of SLID. The City Planning Commission shall
only approve a SLID that is consistent with the objectives set forth in Section
1244.01. Therefore, the City Planning Commission may require as a condition of
approval any reasonable condition, limitation or design factor that will
promote proper development of a SLID.
   F.   A map of approved Small Lot Infill Developments shall be prepared  and
maintained by the Shaker Heights Planning Department.
      (Ord. 18-25.  Enacted 4-23-18.)

1244.11  DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
   Constructing infill housing offers a unique set of design challenges not
only on the parcel level, but also on the neighborhood level and within the
public realm.  Therefore, it is important to consider the design elements of
each small lot home and how it will enhance the overall neighborhood character
and vitality of the larger public realm.  This Section articulates design
requirements to ensure infill development permitted by this Chapter is
compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. 
   A.   The City's adopted Design Guidelines for Multi-Family and Attached
Single-Family Infill Housing shall be considered in the design and layout of
SLID projects, supplemented with the additional design principles in this
section.
   B.   Public Realm.  Each infill project, however small, must contribute to a
vital and coherent public realm. To do so, each project should focus on the
relationship between the proposed small lot subdivision and the public
environment, with emphasis on: building orientation toward the existing public
street, articulation of facades and entry ways, landscaping, lighting, building
fenestration, pedestrian circulation, type and location of driveways and
garages.
   C.   Building size and massing.  Infill development should be compatible
with other units within the Development Influence Area in regards to size,
bulk, scale, mass, and rhythm.  Dwellings shall either be similar in size and
height, or if larger, be articulated and subdivided proportionally to the mass
and scale of other residential buildings in the development influence area. 
The City Planning Commission may limit the height of dwellings based on
prevailing height of existing dwellings in the Development Influence Area.
   D.   Orientation and Entrances.
      1.   Front Unit Orientation.  Each front unit shall be oriented toward
the existing street, and should have the primary entrance and main windows
facing the street with direct access to the public sidewalk.
      2.   Rear and Courtyard Units.  For units that are not adjacent to the
public street, pedestrian circulation shall be provided in the form of private
walkways or clearly delineated paths of travel from the public sidewalk to
their entryway.
   E.   Screening, Privacy, and Landscape Design.
      1.   Screening along SLID site boundaries. To protect existing and future
dwellings in the areas of the SLID site, side and rear yards of the lots in the
new subdivision shall be separated and screened along common lot lines of the
adjacent residential area with a solid wooden fence six (6) feet in height or
with dense evergreen shrubs.
      2.   Interior spaces as well as doors and windows should be configured to
provide privacy between dwelling units and adjacent property.
      3.   Shrubs and tree planting are encouraged to define private space and
increase privacy between infill houses.
      4.   Adequate space to accommodate recycling and trash receptacles should
be provided and appropriately screened.
      5.   All screening and fence material shall be attractive, durable and
contribute to the quality of the residential landscape design.
      6.   All fences shall be erected so that the finished side faces the
neighboring property.
   F.   Lighting.
      1.   Exterior lighting should enhance the overall design and increase
safety.
      2.   All light fixtures should complement the architecture and landscape
design.

1250.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   The following sign regulations are established in order to achieve the
following purposes:
   A.    To preserve the non-commercial character of residential neighborhoods,
and to provide reasonable yet appropriate conditions for identifying businesses
and services rendered in commercial districts by controlling the size, type and
design of signs in relation to the type and size of establishment.
   B.    To reduce traffic hazards by restricting signs and lights which exceed
the viewers’ capacity to receive information or which increase the probability
of accidents created by distracting attention or obstructing vision.
   C.    To preserve order and cleanliness, maintain open spaces and avoid the
appearance of clutter, protect property values, and prevent nuisances and
invitations to vandalism.
   D.    To protect the public peace, health, safety, welfare, convenience and
comfort.
1250.02 HOW SIGNS ARE REGULATED.
   Signs shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with the provisions
set forth in this Chapter. Signs are regulated by different means, including
those enumerated in this section. Each means of regulation has an impact on the
design of a sign and the regulations are applied collectively to each sign
installation.
   A.    Other City Codes.
      1.    All signs shall be constructed, erected and maintained in
accordance with the Shaker Heights Building Code.
      2.    The provisions of this Chapter shall not amend, nor in any way
interfere with, other codes, rules or regulations governing traffic signs
within the City.
   B.    Regulations Found Within This Chapter.
      1.    Classification of Signs.  Four classes of signs are regulated by
the City: Prohibited, Exempt, Temporary, and those requiring permits.
Regulations for each of these are included within this Chapter.
      2.    Sign Function and Type Regulated by District.  Regulations specific
to a particular district are included in Section
1250.07, Sign Regulations by District. The zoning districts regulate what sign
type may be used in that district. Further limitations to height or sign area
may be placed upon signs as part of a particular district’s regulations.
      3.    Design Characteristics Regulated by Sign Type.  Sign Types are
regulated in Section
1250. 08, Regulations by Sign Type. Standard requirements for height and sign
area are included for each sign type. These regulations may be further altered
within districts for specific applications of a particular sign type.
      4.    Primary and Secondary Signs.  Window, projecting and canopy signs,
where permitted, may be installed either as primary or secondary signs subject
to all the other applicable regulations for such signs. Regulation of the sign
and limitations upon other signage are dependent upon whether the sign owner
has chosen to install the sign as primary or secondary. Such restrictions are
established in Section
1250.08, Regulations by Sign Type.
      5.    Additional Factors.  Certain signs are regulated on the basis of
additional factors which are set forth in applicable sections of this Chapter.
1250.03 PROHIBITED AND EXEMPT SIGNAGE.
   A.    Prohibited Signs.  The following signs are prohibited in all
districts:

business. This category (6) does not include signs which are accessory to
parking lots.

would impair the visibility of a temporary lawn sign as observed from the
street, then the Zoning Administrator may grant exceptions to the size and
location regulations above pursuant to the following:
            1.    The height and area requirements above may be increased by a
factor no greater than fifty percent (50%).
            2.    The lawn sign may be placed within twenty (20) feet of the

shall exceed that height, area or distance which is reasonably necessary to
render the sign visible when observed from the street.
            3.    All temporary signs in residential districts shall be
displayed no more than forty-five (45) days after placement, after which time
they must either be removed or replaced.
   B.    Commercial Districts.

Such signs may identify the owner’s name, the architect, the contractors, the
financing arrangements, and the purpose for which the project is intended. No
products or services may be advertised on construction signs. One (1)
construction sign may be placed on each part of the lot or on each face of the
building that borders a public street. A minimum setback of ten (10) feet from

1251.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   In order to relieve traffic congestion in the streets, to minimize any
detrimental effects of off-street parking areas on adjacent properties, and to
ensure the proper and uniform development of off-street parking areas
throughout the City, off-street parking and loading spaces and driveways for
every use shall be provided in accordance with the standards established in
this Zoning Ordinance.
1251.02 REQUIRED NUMBER OF OFF-STREET PARKING SPACES.
   A.    Except as provided elsewhere in this Zoning Ordinance, each principal
and accessory use of land shall be provided with the number of off-street
parking spaces indicated for that use in
Table 1251.02, Schedule of Off-Street Parking Requirements. When the intensity
of use of any structure or lot is increased through a change in use or the
addition of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, or other units
of measurement used in
Table 1251.02, Schedule of Off-Street Parking Requirements, additional parking
facilities shall be provided as required for the entire use as increased.
   B.    Minimum requirements shall be computed per dwelling unit or on the
gross square footage of the building or buildings excepting space used
exclusively for mechanical equipment necessary for lighting, heating or air
conditioning the building.
   C.    When any calculation results in a fraction of a parking space, any
fraction shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.
   D.    In the event this Zoning Ordinance does not specify the number of
parking spaces for a specific use, the Zoning Administrator shall determine the
number of spaces required. In making this determination, the Zoning
Administrator shall consider the following criteria:
      1.    The number of off-street parking spaces required for a use listed
in
Table 1251.02, Schedule of Off-Street Parking Requirements, that is the most
similar to the proposed use in terms of the parked vehicles that are
anticipated to be generated.
      2.    The square footage to be occupied by the proposed use.
      3.    The number of employees and patrons that are anticipated for the
proposed use.
1251.03 CREDIT FOR ON-STREET PARKING.
   Some or all of the requirements for off-street parking spaces may be met by
the provision of onstreet spaces. Such credit shall be calculated by
subtracting the number of marked on-street parking spaces abutting the curb of
the lot on which the building or use is located. Marked spaces which extend
beyond the side property lines of the lot shall not be used in calculating the
credit.
1251.04 EXEMPTION FOR PROVISIONS OF REQUIRED OFF-STREET PARKING SPACES.
   A.    In commercial districts or office districts all business uses in
structures erected prior to the date of this Zoning Ordinance shall be exempt
from the requirements of
Table 1251.02, Schedule of Off-Street Parking Requirements. Notwithstanding the
above, no existing off-street parking spaces shall be eliminated from any
property in these districts unless the same number of
spaces is provided in accordance with all requirements of this Chapter.

1253.01 PURPOSE.
   The landscaping and screening requirements specified in this Chapter are
intended to foster aesthetically pleasing development which will protect and
preserve the appearance, character, health, safety, and welfare of the
community. Specifically, these regulations are intended to increase the
compatibility of adjacent uses, and, in doing so, minimize the harmful impact
of noise, dust and other debris, motor vehicle headlight glare or other
artificial light intrusions, and other objectionable activities or impacts
conducted or created by an adjoining or nearby use.
   The Tree Preservation regulations are intended to preserve the existing
density of trees in the City in order to maintain their positive environmental
effects, and their contributions to the street canopies and balance of nature
and development that is characteristic of Shaker Heights. The requirements are
particularly intended to ensure that developers design and locate projects such
that they minimize the removal of existing trees whenever possible and provide
for the replacement of any trees that must be removed.
1253.02 ENFORCEMENT OF LANDSCAPE REQUIREMENTS.
   Wherever the submission and approval of a Landscape Plan is required by this
Zoning Ordinance, no final occupancy permit shall be issued without City
approval of the Landscape Plan. Failure to implement and maintain the approved
Landscape Plan shall be cause for revocation of the occupancy permit.
1253.03 WHEN LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING ARE REQUIRED.
   A.    All land areas which are not developed or otherwise improved shall be
appropriately
landscaped or shall be left in their natural state.
   B.    Any portion of a property specified herein shall be landscaped
according to these provisions.
1253.04 LANDSCAPE PLAN.
   A.    Landscape Plan Required.  A Landscape Plan is required for all
exterior construction including pools, and ornamental structures, but excepting
other accessory uses unless otherwise required. Such Landscape Plan shall be
drawn in conformance with the requirements specified in this Section. Landscape
Plans must be approved by the Zoning Administrator prior to the issuance of a
building permit unless the development is being reviewed by the City Planning
Commission or Board of Zoning Appeals in which case the Landscape Plan shall be
subject to that body’s review and approval.
   A Landscape Plan must include a Tree Preservation Plan for all new
construction or landscape improvements that propose to remove any existing
trees from the property. The property owner is required to replace or relocate
any trees larger than three (3) inches DBH that are removed for new
construction on the site. Additionally, any trees that are accidentally damaged
during construction must be replaced according to the same regulations. The
owner is encouraged, but not required, to replace any hazard trees that are
dead, diseased, dying, or have a dangerous structural defect.
   B.    Content of Landscape Plan.  All Landscape Plans submitted for approval
shall contain or have attached thereto the following information:
      1.    The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed
landscaping, structures, parking lots and drives, roadways and rights-of-way,
sidewalks, bicycle paths, lawn signs, storage areas, refuse disposal areas,
bicycle parking areas, fences, freestanding electrical equipment, tot lots and
other recreational facilities, storage structures and other freestanding
structural features as determined necessary by the Zoning Administrator.
      2.    The location, quantity, size at planting and at maturity, and name,
both botanical and common names, of all proposed planting materials, including
ground cover.
      3.    Existing and proposed grading of the site, only if the grading will
be altered. This should include proposed berming, indicating contours at one
(1) foot intervals.
      4.    Elevations and materials of all fences proposed for location on the
site.
      5.    Elevations, cross-sections and other details as determined
necessary by the Zoning Administrator.
      6.    A Tree Preservation Plan, which must include:
         a.    A list of the locations, botanical name, dimension at breast
height (DBH), and vertical height of all existing trees on the property, and
the intent to preserve, relocate, or replace each tree.
         b.    When it is not feasible to preserve or relocate an existing
tree, the locations, species, and dimensions of each tree to be removed and the
replacement trees must be specified. For each removed tree, one replacement
tree must be planted in its place within one (1) month or during the next
planting season, either in the same location or a new location on the property.
In the event that it is determined by  the Zoning Administrator that it is not
practical to locate the replacement tree on the property, the Zoning
Administrator has the authority to modify or waive the requirement, or to
require that the replacement tree must be planted on approved public lands or
other approved private property. The cost for removal, relocation, and
replacement of all trees shall be borne by the property owner.
            (1)   A removed tree must be replaced with a replacement tree that
is of the same species, or of a similar species with comparable potential for
shade or screening properties and other characteristics. The Zoning
Administrator may  authorize an alternate replacement species when an exact
species is not available in the required size.
            (2)    Replacement trees must meet the size requirements set forth
in Table 1253.04.
 
Removed Tree (DBH)          Replacement Tree (caliper)
Two (2) to six (6) inches   Two (2) inches
Greater than six (6) inches Four (4) inches
               (Ord. 04-132.  Enacted 11-22-04.)

   A.    Selection.  Planting materials used in conformance with the provisions
of this Section shall be of good quality, of a species normally grown in
northeastern Ohio, and capable of withstanding the extremes of individual site
microclimates. See Section
1253.04.B.7.b.1. Size and density of plant material, both at the time of
planting and at maturity, are additional criteria which must be considered when
selecting plant materials.
   B.    Installation.
      1.    All landscaping materials shall be installed in accordance with the
current planting procedures established by the International Society of
Arboriculture in “Principles and Practices of Planting Trees and Shrubs”.

hedge will not overhang or interfere with the use of a public right-of-way such
as a sidewalk or street.
1253.06 DESIGN CRITERIA.
   Landscape Plans described above shall be prepared based on the following
design criteria. The evaluation and approval of Landscape Plans shall also be
based on these design criteria.
   A.    Scale and Nature of Landscaping Material.  The scale and nature of
landscaping materials should be appropriate to the size of the structures.
Large scaled buildings, for example, should generally be complemented by larger
scaled plants.
   B.    Selection of Plant Material.  Plant material should be selected for
its form, texture, color, and concern for its ultimate growth.
   C.    Evergreens and Screening.  Evergreens and fences should be
incorporated into the landscape treatment of a site, particularly in those
areas screening parking lots, storage or other similar features from dedicated
public rights-of-way or property zoned for residential use.

have a minimum trunk size of two (2) inches in diameter upon installation, as
measured six (6) inches above the established ground level.
   E.    Softening of Walls and Fences.  Plant material should be placed
intermittently against long expanses of building walls, fences, and other
barriers to create a softening effect.
   F.    Foundation Planting.  Foundation planting is required on all
elevations of the main house for new residential construction projects. Such
landscaping is intended to screen the building’s foundation. The majority of
selected plants must be mostly at least two (2) feet tall, and of an amount and
type that are subject to approval by the Zoning Administrator as part of the
Landscape Plan.
   F.    Planting Beds.  Planting beds should be mulched with bark chips,
feather rocks,  mulch, or similar materials.
   G.    Detention/Retention Basins and Ponds. Detention/retention basins and
ponds shall be landscaped. Such landscaping should include shade and ornamental
trees, evergreens, shrubbery, hedges, and/or other planting materials.

provided. A hose bib shall be provided within one hundred (100) feet of all
landscape areas. Installation of an automatic underground sprinkling system is
recommended but not required.
   I.    Energy Conservation.  The following criteria is not required however,
the City encourages such consideration.
      1.    Deciduous trees should be placed on the south and west sides of
buildings to provide shade from the summer sun.
      2.    Evergreens and other plant materials should be concentrated on the
north side of buildings to dissipate the effect of winter winds.
   J.    Preservation of Existing Plant Material and Trees.  Existing plant
material and trees should, wherever practical as determined by the Zoning
Administrator, be incorporated into the landscape treatment of a site.
   K.    Berming.  Earthen berms and existing topography should be, whenever
determined practical by the Zoning Administrator, incorporated into the

1262.02 ANTENNAE.
   The following regulations apply to all antennae, except for Wireless
Telecommunication Facilities as defined in Chapter
1243 of this code.
   A.    Purpose and Intent.  This Section is intended to comply with federal
law, policies and guidelines. This Section is also intended to comply with
federal policies and guidelines in that it does not differentiate among types
of antennae. This Section is also intended to comply with the policies and
guidelines and of state and federal laws including the Federal
Telecommunications Act of 1996 in that it does not intend to impair the
installation, maintenance, or use of antennae. However, this section is
intended to preserve the city’s right to reasonably restrict placement of
antennae in order to preserve historic districts, including without limitations
the consideration of aesthetic issues other than historic considerations such
as the relative height of structures and trees, views, preservation of
residential areas, property value.
This Section is also intended to comply with state and federal law to the
degree permitted and intended to comply with the Secretary of the Interior’s
Standards for Rehabilitation  and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic
Buildings, which recommends against:
“Introducing new construction onto the building site that is visually
incompatible in terms of size, scale, design, materials, color and texture or
which destroys historic relationships on the site.” According to Federal
Regulation 36 CFR 800.5 (a) (1), the installation of an antenna is considered
to alter, either directly or indirectly, any of the characteristics of a
historic property for inclusion in the National Register in a manner that would
diminish the integrity of the property’s location, design, setting, materials,
workmanship, feelings, or association, diminishing the integrity of the
property’s historic features.
   B.    Health and Safety Objectives.  The City Council intends to protect the
public health and safety of the citizens of the City of Shaker Heights from
potential hazards associated with the installation and maintenance of antennae
within the City. The restrictions and standards herein are intended to assure
that all antennae installations are adequately constructed and located so as to
minimize potential detrimental effects associated with such installations.
   C.    Aesthetic Objectives.  In addition to public health and safety
concerns, the City Council intends to satisfy the following aesthetic
objectives:
      1.    Preserving the historic character of the City of Shaker Heights as
evidenced by the designation of three fourths of the City as an historical
district that is recognized by the National Register of Historic Places, which
designation has been based in large part upon the architectural and other
aesthetic qualities of both residential and commercial districts within the
City.
      2.    Preserving the planned community concept of the Van Sweringens,
which was based upon quality housing within a residential zone, commercial
areas which are convenient for shopping and other commercial uses, and public
transportation with access to the industrial and commercial areas of downtown
Cleveland.
      3.    Preserving the distinctive nature of the homes in the residential
areas of the City of Shaker Heights, including many century homes and
neighborhoods which have been designed and preserved for the purpose of the
well-being of the communities within the City.
      4.    Preserving the image of the City as a community which is concerned
about its fine stands of trees and other vegetation, which is evidenced by the
tree trimming and preservation programs which have been provided by the City to
its residents.
   D.    General Requirements.
      1.    Antennae shall be permitted as follows subject to the other
requirements herein, including the requirements for structures located in a
historic district:
         a.    One (1) private non-commercial antenna, including satellite
receiving dishes of one meter or less and antennae designed to receive 
television broadcast signals, shall be permitted for each dwelling unit in SF
and TF Districts.
         b.    One private non-commercial antenna serving a specific structure
type, whether reception or transmission, is permitted per multiple-family
building.
         c.    Two private non-commercial antenna serving a specific structure
type, whether reception or transmission, is permitted per commercial use,
whether freestanding or part of a multi-use building.
         d.    Antennae for the purpose of receiving RF signals and for amateur
or “ham radio” transmitting are permitted in all districts.
      2.    Other Antennae Require Conditional Use Permit.  Any antenna which
does not fit into the above antennae types shall require a Conditional Use
Permit.
   E.    Size and Location Restrictions.  All antennae shall be mounted on
anchored to the principle structure unless there is no practical placement
location as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
      1.    Satellite dishes less than 1 meter in diameter and television
broadcast antennae are exempt from a permit but have locational regulations:
         a.    Mounted to a principle structure: each antenna shall be located
on that portion of a hip, gable, or gambrel roof which does not face a public
street and shall be mounted behind the highest roof peak on the main structure.
On flat roofs an antenna shall be located in a way so as to minimize its
visibility from other properties. If affixed to the structure of buildings
within the historic district, antennae and dishes must be installed to avoid
damage, such that if the antenna is removed, it shall not have permanently
altered the structure. When affixed to a masonry structure, antennae must be
attached to the mortar joints, not to the face of the stone or brick.
         b.    Free-standing mounted in the ground: the maximum length or
diameter of any antenna, exclusive of structural supports, shall not exceed ten
(10) feet.
      2.    Antennae Anchored to Principal Structure.  All antennae shall be
mounted on anchored to the principle structure unless there is no practical
placement location as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
The following regulations shall apply to all antennae which are affixed to the
main structure except as provided above on any parcel, including but not
limited to roof mounted antennae and towers which are mounted in the ground and
affixed to the main structure for support. Antennae mounted on or affixed to
detached garages and other accessory structures are not permitted in the City
of Shaker Heights.
         a.    Dimension.  The maximum length or diameter of any antenna,
exclusive of structural supports, shall not exceed ten (10) feet.
         b.    Mounting.  Each antenna shall be located on that portion of a
hip, gable, or gambrel roof which does not face a public street and shall be
mounted behind the highest roof peak on the main structure. On flat roofs an
antenna shall be located in a way so as to minimize its visibility from other
properties. If affixed to the structure of buildings within the historic
district, antennae and dishes must be installed to avoid damage, such that if
the antenna is removed, it shall not have permanently altered the structure.
When affixed to a masonry structure, antennae must be attached to the mortar
joints, not to the face of the stone or brick.
         c.    No antennae including structural supports shall exceed forty
(40) feet in height above average grade, or ten (10) feet above a roof line,
whichever is taller.
      3.    Free Standing Antennae.  Free-standing antennae must be determined
as a suitable alternative to being mounted or anchored to the principle
structure by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator must consider
other practical locations mounted or anchored to the principle structure before
considering a free-standing location.
The following regulations shall apply to all free standing antennae, which are
those antennae mounted in the ground, with or without guy wires.
         a.    Freestanding antennae shall be constructed only in the rear yard
between the side yard setbacks and no closer than ten (10) feet to any property
line.
         b.    Free standing antennae which are transmitting and receiving
antennae shall not be higher than ten (10) feet above the roof line of the main
structure.
         c.    Free standing antennae which are receiving only, exclusive of
supportive structure, shall not exceed a height of ten (10) feet, nor ten (10)
square feet.
   F.    Aesthetic and Screening Requirements.
      1.    All free standing antennae shall be substantially screened by
evergreen trees or shrubbery of at least the height of the unit, such screening
may be open on one (1) side to facilitate reception.
      2.    The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed location is such
that during all seasons, no part of any ground mounted antennae structure will
be visible to the neighbors and the general public from a point that is between
the ground level and six (6) feet above ground level on surrounding property.
This provision is satisfied by the installation of evergreen plantings, which
shall screen the antennae at the time of installation.
      3.    Antennae shall be of a color compatible with the surrounding
landscape and structures, provided such antennae above the roof line may be of
the natural color of the antennae structure.
      4.    All installations shall exhibit architectural quality, coloration
to blend with surroundings, and structural integrity. Experimental or temporary
installations, inferior materials, and questionable stability are not
permitted. In every case, the entire installation  including evergreen
plantings, shall be compatible with the character of the surrounding area of
the City and shall have no adverse impact on the property, the neighborhood, or
general public.
   G.    Structural Safety Requirements.  The following structural safety
requirements shall be applied to all antenna installations. The Building
Department shall review antenna applications as required by the Building Code
for conformance to these requirements.
      1.    If guy wires are used, they shall be sufficiently visible to
prevent accident or injury to any person.
      2.    Every antennae shall be constructed in accordance with the Building

Building Department, if necessary, and a code compliance check from the Zoning
Administrator.
   For all antennae other than a satellite receiving dish of one meter or less
and antenna designed  to receive television broadcast signals; the applicant
must provide:
      1.    A plot plan showing proposed location and dish projection at
extremes of the satellite band to be viewed.

pursuant to, and as required by
1262.02.F., Aesthetic and Screening Requirements, and Chapter
1253, Landscaping and Screening Regulations, of this Zoning Ordinance.
      3.    A description of the use and purpose of the antenna, including
whether it is receiveonly, transmitting-only, or both.
   I.    Impairment of Reception, Line of Sight and Technical Problems. 
      1.    The above regulations are not intended to impair the reception of
an acceptable quality signal for satellite viewing dishes of one meter or less
and an alternative location or landscape plan shall be permitted when it is
shown that they would result in such impairment.
      2.    The Zoning Administrator may consider alternate locations for an
antenna which does not comply with this Zoning Ordinance, provided that the
applicant has proven that such antenna will be entirely inoperable otherwise
for any useful purpose, for reasons of “line of sight” or other technical
reasons, or for reasons set forth in federal law or regulations.

(Ord. 06-53.   Enacted  5-22-06.)

demolition of all types of buildings and structures and appurtenant structures,
to the extent now or hereafter provided for herein.
   The provisions of this Building Code shall not apply to work performed

equipment or structures not specifically regulated in this Code.
(Ord. 64-166.  Enacted 10-26-64.)
1301.04 RELATION TO ZONING.
   It is not the intent of this Building Code to modify the restrictions of the

provisions of this Code shall control.
(Ord. 06-53.   Enacted  5-22-06.)
1301.05 ADMINISTRATION.
   The Building Code shall be administered by the Director of Building and
Housing and the Commissioner of Building and such assistants  as may be

(Ord. 17-92.  Enacted 11-13-17.)
1301.08 VIOLATIONS AND REMEDIES .
   (a)   Notice of Violation.  If the Commissioner finds that a permit has not
been obtained, that work or equipment  is contrary to approved plans,
construction documents and/or applicable codes, or that any other violation of
this Code exists at a property or activity subject to this Code, the
Commissioner may serve a written notice of violation on the owner, agent,
tenant, and/or person responsible, including a contractor, for the violation
and/or for the erection, construction, alteration, extension, repair, moving,
removal, demolition or occupancy of the property. Such notice shall be sent to
the owner, agent, tenant and/or person responsible for the property and/or the
work, and shall state where and in what respect the work or equipment does not
conform to the approved plans or documents or the applicable codes. The notice
shall specify a reasonable period of time in which to conform to said plans,
documents or codes. Before work can continue at the property at which a
violation has been found the violation shall be corrected, including the
resubmission of the plans or drawings and specifications for approval as
required under this Code.
      (1)   The notice of violation must contain a cite to the law or rules
directly involved and shall specify what appliances, site preparations,
additions, or alterations to structures, plans, materials, assemblages or
procedures are necessary for the same to comply with this Code; and
      (2)   The notice of violation must include notice of the procedure for
appeal and, in the case of residential buildings for one, two, or three
families, the right to a hearing before the City's Board of Building Appeals if
requested within thirty (30) days of the mailing of the notice.  The notice
shall inform the party that at the hearing, the party may be represented by
counsel, present arguments or contentions orally or in writing, and present
evidence and examine witnesses appearing for or against the party.
   (b)    Order to Abate a Violation; Stop Work Order.
      (1)     Whenever the Commissioner finds that any work regulated by this
Code has been or is being performed in a manner contrary to the provisions of
this Code or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, the Commissioner is authorized to
issue an Order to Abate the Violation and/or a stop work order. Such an Order
may also be issued whenever the Commissioner finds, after inspection, that the
site preparations or structure to be constructed, or in the case of an
industrialized unit, the installation of the unit, or that the use of an
appliance, materials, assemblage, or manufactured product, does not comply with
the provisions of Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code, or the rules
adopted pursuant thereto as they exist at the time of the enactment of this
section and as they may be hereafter amended. The effect of such an Order shall
be limited to the matter specified in the Order.
      (2)     An Order to Abate and/or a Stop Work Order shall be in writing
and shall be given to the owner of the property, the owner's agent, the person
responsible for the property, and/or the person doing the work. Upon issuance
of an Order to Abate the cited work shall be corrected and brought into
compliance as required in the Order and in this Code. The Order to Abate shall
state the reason for the order, and the conditions under which the cited work
will be approved. Upon issuance of a Stop Work Order, the cited work shall
immediately cease. The Stop Work Order shall state the reason for the order,
and the conditions under which the cited work will be permitted to resume.
      (3)     No person shall continue any work after having been served with a
Stop Work Order, except such work as that person is directed to perform to
remove a violation or unsafe condition.  Failure to cease work after receipt of
a Stop Work Order is hereby declared a public nuisance. (OBC 114)
   (c)   Compliance.  Upon the issuance of a Notice of Violation, and Order to
Abate or a Stop Work Order, the person receiving the Notice or Order shall
correct the violation and/or shall cease or cause to cease the work upon the
site preparations or structure to be constructed or shall cease or cause to
cease using the appliance, materials, assemblages or manufactured product
identified in the order until such time as the appeal provided for in
accordance with the provisions of Section 3781.19 of the Ohio Revised Code or
this Code, and all further appeals from such initial appeal, have been
completed, or the notice or order has been rescinded by the Commissioner.
   (d)   Prosecution and Penalty.  When any violation of this Code exists,
including when any person fails to comply with a Notice of Violation, an Order
to Abate and/or a Stop Work Order, the person committing the violation or
failing to comply with the Notice or Order may be prosecuted.  A person
convicted for any violation of this Code shall be guilty of and subject to the
penalties for a first degree misdemeanor. Each day of such violation or failure
to comply shall constitute a separate offense.
   (e)   Alternative Enforcement.  In addition to or in lieu of a prosecution
for a violation of this Code, the City may also seek in a court of law an order
or injunction requiring an owner, agent or person responsible for compliance
with this Code to comply with the provisions of the Code, or with any Notice or
Order served pursuant to this Code.  Such action may also seek an order to
prevent the occupation or use of the property, including any building or other
structure, and/or to prevent or terminate any violation of this Code.
   (f)   Failure to Comply With Notice or Order; Remedy.  If a person fails to
comply with a Notice of Violation or Stop Work Order, and the time of appeal
has expired then the construction documents required pursuant to Section
3791.04 of the Ohio Revised Code are deemed not to have been filed and
approved, and the provisions of (c) above apply.
   (g)   Resident Agent.  If the owner of any commercial or office structure is
not a resident of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, such owner shall designate and file
with the Director of Building and Housing the name, address, and telephone
number of an agent who is a resident of Cuyahoga County for the purpose of
receiving all notices of inspection, orders or otherwise from the City of
Shaker Heights relative to such structure. Service of notice upon such resident
agent shall be deemed to be notice upon the owner. Any such notice shall also
be sent to the last known address of the owner. Notice may also be posted in a
conspicuous place on the structure or premises to which it relates.  No person
shall remove or deface such posted notice without the written permission of the
Director of Building and Housing.

described in an application for a permit and the plans and specifications filed

1303.06 CONDITIONS OF PERMIT.

the Commissioner of Building from thereafter requiring a correction of errors
in plans or in construction or of violations of this Building Code or of other
applicable laws, ordinances, rules or regulations.  The Commissioner shall not
incur any personal liability or expense upon the City nor shall the
Commissioner or the City be estopped to enforce this Building Code or the

and all work shall be done in accordance with the approved plans and
specifications. One (1) set of approved plans and specifications shall be

permit shall continue in effect for its term, subject to the conditions set
forth above.

intent of this section and the purposes of the Board.

addition, or make or authorize any visible or physical exterior alteration or
change to any building, without submitting an application in writing for review
of such new construction, addition, alteration or change to the Director of
Planning. The Director shall refer to the Architectural Board of Review any
such application that is not otherwise excepted from approval by the Board.
However, an applicant whose plans have not been referred to the Board, may
still request and apply for review and approval of such plans by the Board.
 
   (e)    An application for new construction or for an addition, alteration or
change to any building shall be accompanied by plans and specifications. Such
application shall be in such form, and include such information, and additional

by adequate or sufficiently detailed plans, drawings, specifications, data
reports or other necessary information, as required pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Board, and as determined by the Director of Planning, or the
Director's designee, may be rejected, or its consideration postponed, until the

of action taken in each instance, and no building permit shall be issued by the
Commissioner of Building unless plans and specifications therefor have been
approved in writing by the Board or the Planning Department, or a member or an
alternate of the Board, as provided herein. The Board may delegate to one of
its members, or an alternate, the authority to review and approve a subsequent
modification or alteration of plans as may be imposed by the Board as a
condition of its approval, or to provide preliminary review of plans prior to
their consideration by the Board.
 
   (h)   The Board may authorize the Director of Planning, or a qualified
member of his or her staff, to review and approve plans, without further review
and approval by the Board, in those instances where the review is limited to
specific design guidelines previously established by the Board. However, an
applicant whose plans have been so reviewed by the Department may still request
and apply for review and approval of such plans by the Board.
 
   (i)   The Board may delegate to one or more of its members, or an alternate,
the authority to review and approve plans, without further review and approval
by the Board, in those instances where the review involves routine, general
design guidelines previously established by the Board. However, an applicant
whose plans have been so reviewed by a member of the Board, or an alternate,
may still request and apply for review and approval of such plans by the Board.

or his or her designee, shall notify the applicant in writing of the time and
place of the meeting of the Planning Commission wherein such plans and
specifications will be reviewed.  No building permit shall be issued by the
Commissioner of Building until such plans and specifications have been approved
by the Planning Commission.

be made upon a finding by the Commission that:
      (1)   The design, materials, location and configuration of the proposed
structure will be reasonably compatible in size, quality and appearance with
existing structures in the immediate neighborhood.
      (2)   The design and materials, appearance and quality of construction of

with the Building Code and the plans and specifications so submitted.

1331.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this Chapter, the following definitions shall apply.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these regulations
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   "Accessory structure" means a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   "Appeal" means a request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
   (c)   "Base flood" means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to
as the  one percent (1%)  chance annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   "Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)" means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from 1 to 3 feet).
   (e)   "Basement" means any area of a building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   "Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   "Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor" see "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   "Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management) Issued by President
Carter in 1977," means the Order which requires that no federally assisted
activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special
flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   "Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)" means the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   "Fill" means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   "Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)     The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)     The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source.
   (l)   "Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)" means the map, produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
   (m)   "Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   "Flood Insurance Risk Zones" means the Zone designations on FHBMs and
FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)     Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are  determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood;  areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing  drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)    "Flood Insurance Study (FIS)" means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
    (p)   "Flood Protection Elevation (FPE)" means the base flood elevation. In
areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the
flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
    (q)   "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (r)   "Freeboard" means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
     (s)   "Historic structure" means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the City of Shaker Heights historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
     (t)   "Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis" means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
     (u)   "Letter of Map Change (LOMC)" means an official FEMA determination,
by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down
into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)    "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure,
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in this Chapter for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
    (w)   "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of this Chapter, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
    (x)   "Manufactured home park" means, as specified in the Ohio
Administrative Code 3701-27-01, any tract of land upon which three or more
manufactured homes used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for
revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or
enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A
tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or
rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
    (y)   "National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)" means a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)    "New construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of
Shaker Heights Flood Insurance Rate Map, June 15, 1981, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   "Person" means any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C. 111.15
as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to,
any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
General Assembly, the Controlling Board, the Adjutant General's Department, or
any court.
   (bb)   "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is:
      (1)    Built on a single chassis,
      (2)    400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      (3)    Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)   "Registered Professional Architect" means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 
4703.01 to 4703.19.
   (dd)   "Registered Professional Engineer" means a person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   "Registered Professional Surveyor" means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   "Special Flood Hazard Area" or "Areas of Special Flood Hazard" means
the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal,
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)    "Start of construction" means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on the site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
           (ii)   "Substantial Damage" means damage of any origin sustained by
a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
   (jj)    "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the Improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      (1)    Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction;"
      (2)    Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code provisions which
have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by the
local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure
safe living conditions; or
      (3)    Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"Historic Structure".
   (kk)   "Variance" means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.

1331.07 DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (a)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway areas exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
     (d)    The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions). Where a map boundary and
elevations disagree, the elevations delineated in the flood elevation profile
shall prevail. A person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this
Chapter.
     (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
      (Ord. 10-125. Enacted 11-22-10.)
 
1331.08 SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (a)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (b)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

this Building Code and the Codified Ordinances, and the following criteria:
      (1)     The danger that materials may be swept by flooding onto other
lands to the injury of others.
        (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
        (3)    The susceptibility of the proposed use and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
        (4)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
        (5)   The necessity to the use of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (6)     The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and flood plain management program for that area.
        (7)     The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
      (8)     The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
        (9)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
        (10)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
            (11)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
 
   (e)   The hearing of any such request for a variance by the Board shall be
recorded and shall provide the applicant the right to present witnesses and
evidence under oath.
 
   (f)  The Board shall decide the request for a variance within a reasonable
time after the conclusion of the hearing, and may make its decision in
executive session. The decision shall be in writing and shall include findings
of fact any relevant conclusions of law.
 
   (g)   Upon consideration of the above factors, the Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this Chapter.
(Ord. 10-125. Enacted 11-22-10.)
 
1331.19 STANDARDS FOR GRANTING VARIANCES.
   (a)   Generally, variances may be granted for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing the criteria in this Chapter have been
fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (½) acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
 
   (b)   Variances may be granted for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of a structure that meets the definition of "Historic Structure" in
Section
1331.02(s).
 
   (c)   Variances shall not be granted within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
 
   (d)   Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
 
   (e)   Variances shall only be issued upon a finding of all of the following:
      (1)   Good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant due to the physical characteristics of
the property.  Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the  requirements of
this Chapter do not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, beyond that which is allowed in this Chapter,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, public
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
Federal or State laws or the Codified Ordinances.
      (4)    A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
 
   (f)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice by the Floodplain Administrator that the structure may be built with a
lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
(Ord. 10-125. Enacted 11-22-10.)
 
1331.20 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Failure to obtain a Floodplain Development Permit, to comply with the
terms of such a permit, or of any variance, or to comply with any lawful order
or determination of the Floodplain Administrator or the Administrator's
designee, shall be a violation of this Chapter and shall be punishable in
accordance with this Section and Section
1301.08 of this Building Code.
 
   (b)   Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines that there has been a
violation of any provision of this Chapter, the Administrator may give notice
of such violation to the person responsible for the violation and order
compliance with this Chapter. Any such notice and order shall be in writing;
shall list any violation, list the section of this Chapter that has been
violated, and order remedial action, which, if taken, will effect compliance
with the provisions of this Chapter; shall specify a reasonable time for
performance; and shall advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to
appeal. Notice shall be provided as set forth in Section
1301.08. Whenever a person found to be violating this Chapter is a repeat
offender, the Administrator may immediately refer the matter to the Law
Director for possible action rather send a notice as described herein.
 
   (c)   Violation of the provisions of this Chapter or failure to comply with
any of its requirements shall be deemed to be a strict liability offense, and
shall constitute a first degree misdemeanor. Each day a violation continues
shall be considered a separate offense.
 
   (d)   Nothing herein shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful
civil or criminal action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
(Ord. 10-125. Enacted 11-22-10.)
 
1331.21 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this Chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This Chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the City of Shaker Heights, any
officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for
any flood damage that results from reliance on this Chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 10-125. Enacted 11-22-10.)

Section
1333.05.
   (b)   No person shall abrasively clean, remove, or strip paint from the

      (1)   Abrasive cleaning or stripping; or
      (2)   Any other process, including heat guns, scraping or power sanding
where paint is being removed from more than twenty-five percent (25%) of any
exterior wall surface of a structure
without first obtaining a permit from the Commissioner of Building.  A separate
permit is required for each separate job or location.

to the City in the minimum amount of three thousand dollars ($3,000) as
security for compliance.
      (2)   The Commissioner of Building may require an additional deposit if
the Commissioner determines that the amount of security is insufficient to
secure compliance with this chapter.
   (c)   Inspection and Clean-Up.  The Commissioner of Building or the
Commissioner's designee may inspect the work periodically. Upon completion of

inspection of all rental units, as defined in Section
1413.01, in single-family and two-family dwelling structures, except the

according to a schedule established by him.  The Director may require an
inspection and a Certificate of Housing Inspection as a condition to the
issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy pursuant to Section

Inspection has been issued pursuant to Chapter

or his agent, that arrangements must be made with the Building and Housing
Department for an inspection appointment within thirty days of such notice.  It
shall be the duty of the owner or agent, upon consent, to cause the entire
structure to be accessible for inspection at the time arranged, which shall be
during regular business hours.  If the owner or agent, or an occupant, refuses
to consent to an inspection of the subject property, or if consent is otherwise
unobtainable, the Director of Building and Housing or his designated
representative shall not make such inspection without first obtaining a search
warrant as provided in Section
1409.02.  The above required tri-annual inspection of single-family homes may
be waived by the Director of Building and Housing upon the submission of the
affidavit of the owner that:
      (1)   The rental is temporary, i.e., not for more than three years;
      (2)   The owner has moved out of the Cuyahoga County area and intends to
return to reside on the property within the designated time; and
      (3)   The name, address and telephone number of a resident agent who
lives in Cuyahoga County who may be served with a notice of violations and who
will be responsible for property maintenance, is provided.
   The waiver of the inspection requirement may be revoked by the Director of
Building and Housing should the owner fail to comply with the requirements or
should it be apparent that the rental is no longer temporary.
   (b)   The Director of Building and Housing is hereby directed to conduct an
inspection of the third floor of every two-family dwelling structure which
third floor is a nonconforming use under the Zoning Code or Housing Code, at
least once every year according to a schedule established by him, where such
third floor has been occupied by a roomer at any time during the year prior to
the date of inspection.  Such inspection will not be required if a Certificate
of Housing Inspection has been issued pursuant to Chapter
1415 for the same structure within one (1) year previous to the date the
structure would have been inspected under the schedule established by the
Director of Building and Housing, or if the owner or agent indicates in writing
to the Director that the third floor has ceased to be occupied by a roomer and
that such use has been permanently abandoned.  The method of inspection and
notice shall be as provided in subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)   Either the Commissioner of Building or the Director of Building and
Housing is hereby directed to conduct an inspection of each child day care
service as provided in Section
1231.02(b)(9) of the Zoning Code.  The method of inspection and notice shall be
as provided in subsection (a) hereof.  The provider of the child day care
service shall apply for the inspection no later than sixty (60) days after
commencement of the service.
(Ord. 17-92.  Enacted 11-13-17.)
1413.04 CERTIFICATE OF HOUSING INSPECTION.
   Upon inspection of the dwelling structure, the Director of Building and
Housing shall issue a Certificate of Housing Inspection.  Except in the case of
immediate danger to the public health or safety, the Certificate of Housing
Inspection shall contain the order of the Director of Building and Housing for
the correction of any code violations noted on the Certificate, which shall be
corrected by the owner of the property within ninety (90) days of the issuance
of the Certificate, unless for good cause shown, the Director has extended the
time for such completion.
(Ord. 17-92.  Enacted 11-13-17.)
1413.05 FORMS, RULES AND REGULATIONS; APPEALS.

(Ord. 17-44.  Enacted 4-24-17.)
1415.05 CERTIFICATE OF INSPECTION OR COMPLIANCE; ESCROW; APPEAL.
   (a)    No person, agent, firm or corporation shall sell, transfer, convey,
accept, obtain or purchase an interest in the title of improved residential
real estate, including entering into a land installment contract for the sale
or transfer of such a property, without complying with the point-of-sale
requirements of this Chapter, including the establishment of an escrow account
as required in this Section.
   (b)    No business entity, domestic or foreign, using a name other than an
individual's own personal name, shall sell, transfer, convey, accept, obtain or
purchase an interest in the title of improved residential real estate,
including entering into a land installment contract for the sale or transfer of
such a property, unless such entity is registered with the Ohio Secretary of
State as required by Title XVII of the Ohio Revised Code of an entity in order
to do business in the State of Ohio.
   (c)   Prior to the closing of a transfer of improved residential real
estate, the seller or transferor shall provide the purchaser or transferee with
a current certificate of inspection or a certificate of compliance, shall
verify that sufficient funds have been deposited in escrow as required in this
Section, shall deposit in escrow a statement signed by the purchaser or
transferee acknowledging receipt of the certificate of inspection or
certificate of compliance, and such statement shall list thereon the date the
certificate was given to the purchaser and a copy shall be provided to the
Building and Housing Department.
   (d)    Prior to the closing of a transfer of improved residential real
estate, the purchaser or transferee shall have received a current certificate
of inspection or a certificate of compliance, shall have designated in writing
with the Building and Housing Department the name, address, and telephone
number of an agent who is a resident of Cuyahoga County, pursuant to Section
1409.03, if the purchaser or transferee resides outside of Cuyahoga County at
the time of closing and will not occupy the premises as a primary residence,
and shall verify that sufficient funds have been deposited in escrow as
required in this Section.
   (e)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, if all violations
listed on the certificate of inspection are not corrected prior to transfer of
title or execution and recording of a land installment contract, funds shall be
deposited with an escrow agent designated by the City, in an amount not less
than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and equal to one hundred fifty percent
(150%) of the estimated cost of repairs, to pay for the cost to correct all
remaining violations. The amount to be held in escrow shall be determined as
follows:
      (1)   The transferor or transferee shall procure a written estimate from
a company currently registered under Chapter
547 of the Codified Ordinances (hereinafter referred to as a "qualified
company").
      (2)     The estimate shall be in good faith and shall reflect current
market rates for labor and materials.
      (3)    The cost of repairs shall be itemized, to the extent practicable,
in a manner that relates to the point-of-sale violation list.
      (4)    The Director of Building and Housing or the Director's  designee
shall determine whether the estimate complies with the requirements of this
Section and may reject an estimate that fails to reasonably reflect the fair
market cost of repairs.
      (5)     If the Director of Building and Housing rejects an estimate as
provided herein, the party submitting the estimate may provide the Director a
new estimate that complies with the requirements of this Section. If the
Director rejects an estimate, the Director may send a written notice of such
rejection to the party establishing the escrow.
      (6)    If the party establishing the escrow  can demonstrate to the
Director of Building and Housing that after a good faith effort he/she is
unable to obtain a written estimate from a qualified company, or if the party
establishing the escrow makes a request to the Director, the Director may
establish the amount of the escrow upon the payment by such party of the fee
set forth in Section
1415.04.
      (7)     The party establishing the escrow may appeal the decision of the
Director to reject an  estimate of the cost of repairs, or the amount of the
escrow if it is established by the Director, to the Board of Appeals within
thirty (30) days from the date of Director's written decision or estimate.
   (f)   A purchaser or transferee of a property requiring substantial
rehabilitation, with the approval of the transferor or seller or a signed
purchase agreement, may submit a request to the Director for a variance from
the escrow requirement, to request a reduction of the required escrow amount of
150% of the cost of repairs to 100% of the cost. The Director may grant such a
variance if the purchaser or transferee is a contractor that has been approved
to participate in the City's Shaker Renovator Program, or if the purchaser or
transferee has a signed contract with a contractor that is a participant in the
Program. The Director of Neighborhood Revitalization is authorized to establish
rules and regulations for a Shaker Renovator Program.
   (g)    A seller or transferor, or a purchaser or transferee, with the
approval of the transferor or seller or a signed purchase agreement, may submit
an appeal to the Board of Appeals requesting a variance from the escrow
requirements. In any such appeal, the appellant must demonstrate that:
      (1)   Special circumstances exist necessitating a variance from the
requirements in order to make the sale and repair of the property financially
practicable,
      (2)   The purchaser or transferee has the financial capability to repair
the property in a reasonable period of time in order to bring it into
compliance with the Housing Code; and
      (3)   A variance is in the best interests of the City and its residents.
   (h)    Funds shall be disbursed only upon written authorization from the
Director or the Director's designee. Authorization to release funds held in
escrow pursuant to this subsection shall be granted  upon the determination by
the Director of Building and Housing that substantial progress has been made in
correcting the violations and that sufficient funds will remain in escrow to
correct all remaining violations.
      (1)   If the funds held in escrow are less than five thousand dollars
($5,000), no funds held in escrow shall be released until all violations are
corrected.
      (2)   If the funds held in escrow exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000)
but are less than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), the Director or the
Director's designee may authorize one partial release of funds from escrow.
      (3)   If the funds held in escrow are equal to or exceed twenty thousand
dollars ($20,000) but are less than forty thousand dollars ($40,000), the
Director or the Director's designee may authorize two partial releases of funds
from escrow.
      (4)   If the funds held in escrow are equal to or exceed forty thousand
dollars ($40,000) but are less than sixty thousand dollars ($60,000), the
Director or the Director's designee may authorize three partial releases of
funds from escrow.
      (5)   If the funds held in escrow are equal to or exceed sixty thousand
dollars ($60,000), the Director or the Director's designee may authorize four
partial releases of funds from escrow.
   (i)    The Director may approve, in lieu of an escrow being established, a
purchase-rehabilitation loan account established through a private or
government lender. The Director may require written evidence of the terms of
the purchase-rehabilitation loan and other documentation that the Director
determines is necessary to evaluate the substitution of the loan for a point-
of-sale escrow account. In determining whether to approve the loan as a
substitute for an escrow account, the Director shall consider all of the
following: the City's experience with the lender in other purchase-
rehabilitation loan situations, the lender's oversight and management of such
loans, the amount of funds provided for improvements to the property beyond
correction of the existing code violations, proof that sufficient funds are
being held to pay for repairs to correct all point-of-sale violations, and any
other factor that would tend to support a conclusion that the intent of the
point-of-sale escrow provisions will be met by the structure and terms of the
loan.
   (j)    In the event the purchaser or grantee of residential real estate, in
a transaction covered by this Chapter, intends to demolish the structure or
structures covered by a certificate of inspection, the escrow requirements of
this Section shall be waived if the purchaser or transferee provides the City a
performance bond or equivalent financial guarantee in a form satisfactory and
approved by the Director of Law, issued to the City in an amount reasonably
calculated, as determined by the Director, to ensure that either the structure
or structures are demolished or the violations listed on the certificate of
inspection are corrected.
   (k)    No escrow or bond shall be required if the City is the purchaser or
transferee of the property, whether the property is intended to be repaired or
demolished.
   (l)    If all repairs to a property required on a Certificate of Inspection
are not completed within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the
Director or the Director's designee, the City may withdraw such funds from the
escrow account as shall be necessary to pay for the completion of the repairs
or demolition of the property, as the City determines to be necessary. The City
shall provide written notice to the owner and any lessee or party in control of
a property, and to the party that established the escrow, at least thirty days
prior to the City's withdrawal of funds from the escrow account.

Zoning Code and other applicable ordinances of the City at the time of the

for herein, or unless the buyer has actual knowledge of the deficiencies or
violations in the structures at the time of the contract of sale.  (Ord. 17-

1421.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   It is hereby found and declared that there exist in the City multiple-
dwelling structures and apartment houses which are, or may become in the
future, substandard with respect to structure, equipment or maintenance; or
further, that such conditions including but not limited to structural
deterioration, lack of maintenance and appearance of the exterior of such
buildings, infestation, existence of fire hazards, unsanitary conditions and
overcrowding constitute a menace to the peace, health, safety, welfare and
reasonable comfort of the residents of the City.  It is further found and
declared that by reason of lack of maintenance and because of progressive
deterioration, certain properties have the further effect of creating blighting
conditions; and that if the same are not curtailed and removed, such conditions
will grow and spread and will necessitate in time the expenditure of large
amounts of public funds to correct and eliminate same; and that by reason  of
timely regulation as herein contained, the growth of blight may be prevented
and the neighborhood and property values thereby maintained, the desirability
and amenities of multiple-dwelling and apartment house uses and neighborhoods
enhanced, and the public peace, health, safety and welfare protected and
improved.
(Ord. 94-4.  Enacted 2-28-94.)
