1.6 RELATIONSHIP TO THE COMPREHENSIVE LAND USE PLAN
The Comprehensive Land Use Plan serves as the basic policy guide for development under this UDO. The policies and action items of the Comprehensive Plan may be amended from time to time to meet the changing requirements of the Town in accordance with the standards and procedures in Section 2.8, COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.
1.7 RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER LAWS
A. PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS

B. CONFLICTS WITH OTHER LAWS, ORDINANCES OR REGULATIONS
1. If any provisions of this UDO are inconsistent with similar provisions of State or Federal law, the more restrictive provision shall control, to the extent permitted by law.
2. Conflicts and duplications among portions of this UDO shall be resolved in favor of the more stringent regulation.
3. The adoption of this Ordinance shall have the following effect upon violations of the previous ordinance that existed on the effective date of this Ordinance:

If the circumstances that constituted the violation under the previous ordinance do not constitute a violation under this Ordinance, then no further punitive or corrective action shall be taken with respect to the previous violation.
1. If the situation that constituted the violation under the previous ordinance continues to constitute a violation under this Ordinance, then appropriate corrective or punitive action may be taken under this Ordinance.
2. If a non-conforming situation or condition was created under the previous ordinance and that non-conforming situation or condition resulted in a violation of that ordinance, and the violation consisted of the failure to correct or terminate the non-conforming situation when required to do so under the previous Ordinance, and under the new Ordinance the situation or condition is still not permissible, then passage of the new Ordinance shall not prevent appropriate enforcement action to require the termination of the non-conforming situation, even if termination of the non-conforming situation would not be required under this Ordinance.
1.8 SEVERABILITY
It is expressly declared that this UDO and each section, subsection, sentence, and phrase would have been adopted regardless of whether one or more other portions of the UDO are declared invalid or unconstitutional.

1.9 ZONING MAP
A. GENERALLY
The Official Zoning Map designates the location and boundaries of the various base zoning and overlay zoning districts established in this Ordinance. The Official Zoning Map shall be kept on file in the Planning Department and is available for public inspection during normal business hours. The original official version of the map shall be certified by the Planning Director. It may be kept in either hardcopy or digital form. It shall be the final authority as to the status of the current zoning district classification of land in the town, and shall only be amended in accordance with this Ordinance. In accordance with N.C. Gen. Stat. § 160A-22, the Town Clerk shall certify the Official Zoning Map for use as evidence in a court of law.
B. INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE
The Official Zoning Map, and all the notations thereon, is incorporated herein by reference and made part of this Ordinance.
C. ZONING CLASSIFICATION OF LANDS ADDED TO JURISDICTION
1. TOWN BOARD DETERMINATION
The Town Council shall determine the zoning designation of lands added to the town's jurisdiction through annexation or through extensions of the Town’s extraterritorial jurisdiction at the time such lands are added based on the following factors: The land’s designation on adopted plans addressing the town’s growth and development;
(a) The land’s current land use;
(b) The existence of a previously-approved site or subdivision plan;
(c) The character of adjacent lands;
(d) Current county zoning classifications, if applicable;
(e) Landowner requests; and
(f) Other factors considered relevant at the time of the annexation.
2. RELATIONSHIP TO VOLUNTARY ANNEXATION REQUESTS
Where an area is proposed to be added to the town’s jurisdiction through a landowner’s petition for voluntary annexation, the landowner may submit an application for a Zoning Map Amendment (See Section 3.6 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE, COMPREHENSIVE LAND USE PLAN, AND COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AMENDMENTS ) requesting a specific zoning district classification along with the annexation petition. In such a case, the public hearing for the Zoning Map Amendment application may be held concurrently with any public hearing required for the annexation.
3. RELATIONSHIP TO INVOLUNTARY ANNEXATION
Where an area is proposed to be added to the town’s jurisdiction through the involuntary annexation process, a landowner may submit an application for a Zoning Map Amendment (See Section 3.6 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE, COMPREHENSIVE LAND USE PLAN, AND COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AMENDMENTS) requesting a specific zoning district classification.
D. INTERPRETATION OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP BOUNDARIES
1. The Planning Director shall be responsible for interpretations of the Official Zoning Map in accordance with the following requirements:
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 1: General Provisions
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 1-5
(a) Boundaries shown as approximately following a utility line or a street, alley, railroad, or other public access way shall be interpreted as following the centerline of the right-of-way or easement for the utility line or access way.
(b) Boundaries shown as approximately following a property line shall be interpreted as following the property line as it existed when the boundary was established. If a subsequent minor adjustment (such as from settlement of a boundary dispute or overlap) results in the property line moving ten feet or less, the zoning boundary shall be interpreted as moving with the property line.
(c) Boundaries shown as approximately following a river, stream, canal, lake, or other watercourse shall be interpreted as following the centerline of the watercourse as it actually exists, and as moving with that centerline to the extent the watercourse moves as a result of natural processes (flooding, erosion, sedimentation, etc.).
(d) Boundaries shown as approximately following established municipal corporate limits or other political boundaries shall be interpreted as following the corporate limits or boundary as they existed when the boundary was established.
(e) Boundaries shown parallel to or as extensions of features indicated in this subsection shall be interpreted as such.
2. If the specific location of a depicted boundary cannot be determined from notations on the Official Zoning Map or application of the above standards, it shall be determined by using the map’s scale to determine the boundary’s distance from other features shown on the map.
3. Where the actual locations of existing physical or natural features vary from that shown on the Official Zoning Map, or in other circumstances not covered by this subsection, the Planning Director shall have the authority to interpret the district boundaries. Appeals of the Planning Director’s decision shall be reviewed by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with Section 3.10, APPEAL.
E. CHANGES TO OFFICIAL ZONING MAP
Changes made in zoning district boundaries, including requests for a rezoning, or other matters portrayed on the Official Zoning Map shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.6 of this Ordinance. Changes shall be entered on the Official Zoning Map by the Planning Director promptly after the amendment is approved by the Town Council. Where the ordinance enacting a zoning district boundary change contains wording explaining or clarifying the location of the new boundary, the Planning Director may enter on the Official Zoning Map notations reflecting the ordinance wording. The Planning Director shall maintain copies of superseded versions of the Official Zoning Map for historical reference.
1.10 TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS
A. VIOLATIONS CONTINUE
Subject to the specific provisions of Section 1.7 above, any violation of the previous zoning regulations or subdivision regulations shall continue to be a violation under this Ordinance and any other applicable ordinances, laws, or statutes. Violations of this Ordinance shall be subject to the penalties set forth in Section 9, ENFORCEMENT, and any other applicable ordinances, laws, or statutes, unless the development complies with the express terms of this Ordinance or the other ordinances, laws, or statutes.
B. COMPLETE APPLICATIONS
1. Any development application submitted and accepted as complete before effective date, but still pending final action as of that date, shall be reviewed and decided in accordance with the regulations in effect when the application was accepted. No application shall be considered complete unless and until the entire application fee has been paid in accordance with the current fee schedule. To the extent such an application is approved and proposes development that does not comply with this Ordinance, the subsequent development, although permitted, shall be nonconforming and subject to the provisions of Section 7, NONCONFORMITIES.
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 1: General Provisions
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 1-6
2. Completed applications shall be processed in good faith and shall comply with any time frames for review, approval, and completion as established in the regulations in effect at the time the application is accepted as complete. If a development is approved, but does not commence and continue within the required time frames, it shall expire and future development of the property shall be subject to the requirements of this Ordinance.
3. An applicant with a pending complete application accepted before effective date may opt to have the proposed development reviewed and decided under the standards of this Ordinance by withdrawing the pending application and submitting a new application in accordance with the standards of this Ordinance.
C. APPROVED APPLICATIONS
Any development approval granted before the effective date of this Ordinance shall remain valid until their expiration date. Developments with valid approvals or permits may be carried out in accordance with the terms and conditions of approval and the development standards in effect at the time of approval, provided the permit or approval is valid and has not expired. If the prior approval expires or is revoked (e.g., for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of approval), any subsequent development application for the site shall be subject to the procedures and standards of this Ordinance. To the extent, a prior-approved application proposes development that does not comply with this Ordinance, the subsequent development, although permitted, shall be nonconforming and subject to the provisions of Section 7, NONCONFORMITIES.
D. NONCONFORMITIES
If any use, structure, lot, or sign legally existed on the effective date, but does not fully comply with the standards of this Ordinance, then that use, structure, lot, or sign shall be considered nonconforming under this Ordinance and shall be controlled by the provisions of Section 7, NONCONFORMITIES.
1.11 VESTED RIGHTS
A. ESTABLISHMENT
A vested right pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 160A-385.1 shall be deemed established with respect to real property subject to the Town of Wallace zoning jurisdiction upon approval by the permit-issuing authority of a site specific development plan or phased development plan following notice and public hearing as required by this Ordinance. The establishment of a vested right shall not preclude the application of overlay zoning that imposes additional requirements but does not affect the allowable types or intensity of uses, or the application of ordinances or regulations that are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to land use regulation by the Town, including, but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical codes. Otherwise, applicable new or amended regulations shall become effective with respect to property that is subject to a site specific or phased development plan upon the expiration or termination of the vested right in accordance with this chapter.
B. SITE-SPECIFIC AND PHASED DEVELOPMENT PLANS
1. PHASED DEVELOPMENT PLAN
“Phased Development Plan” means a plan of land development which has been submitted to the Town by a landowner for phased development describing with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels of land but with a lesser degree of certainty than any plan determined by the Town to be a Site Specific Development Plan. A “Master Plan” is a type of Phased Development Plan. Approval of a Master Plan pursuant to Section 3.7 of this Ordinance shall trigger a vested right. A Phased Development Plan shall be deemed approved upon the effective date of the permit issuing authority’s action.
2. SITE SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN
“Site Specific Development Plan” means a plan of land development submitted to the town by a landowner that describes with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels of land. The following types of applications constitute a Site Specific Development Plan:
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 1: General Provisions
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 1-7
A Special Use Permit pursuant to Section 3.8 of this Ordinance
(a) To qualify as a Site Specific Development Plan, the plan submitted, shall include the following information: total acreage of the site; approximate boundaries of the site; significant topographical and other natural features affecting development of the site; the approximate location on the site of all proposed buildings and other structures (including roads and parking facilities); maximum gross floor areas and impervious surface; and the infrastructure on the site, including water, sewer, roads, and pedestrian walkways.
(b) The permit-issuing authority may approve a Site Specific Development Plan upon such terms as may be reasonably necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. The specific requirements of other sections of this Ordinance shall be the presumptive minimum standards which applicants must meet; however, the permit issuing authorities may waive or modify those minimum requirements upon (i) the applicant’s specific, written request for a waiver or modification and (ii) the presentation of satisfactory, competent evidence by the applicant demonstrating that the applicant’s proposal otherwise satisfies or meets the need the minimum standard to be waived or modified was intended to address.
C. VESTED RIGHT
1. "Vested right" means the right to undertake and complete the development and use of property under terms and conditions of an approved building permit, or an approved site specific or phased development plan, including any amendments thereto. Conditional approval of a site specific or phased development plan shall result in a vested right, although failure to abide by such terms and conditions will result in forfeiture thereof.
2. A variance shall not constitute a site specific or phased development plan, and a site specific or phased development plan with a condition that a variance be obtained shall not confer a vested right unless the necessary variance is obtained. Neither a sketch plan nor any other document which fails to describe with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specified parcel or parcels of property may constitute a site specific or phased development plan.
D. DURATION AND TERMINATION OF STATUTORY VESTED RIGHTS
1. An approved Site Specific Development Plan which has been vested as provided for in this section shall remain vested for a period of two (2) years from the date of approval. This vesting shall not be extended by any amendments or modifications to a Site Specific Development Plan unless the property owner (or authorized agent) requests an extension in writing, and the permit-issuing authority approves such extension.
2. An approved Phased Development Plan which has been vested as provided for in this section shall remain vested for a period of five (5) years. The developer or landowner must submit a site specific development plan for approval with respect to each phase in order to obtain final development approval for such phase. This vesting shall not be extended by any amendments or modifications to a Phased Development Plan unless the property owner (or authorized agent) requests an extension in writing, and permit-issuing authority approves such extension.
3. Following approval or conditional approval of a Site Specific or Phased Development Plan, nothing in this section shall exempt such a plan from subsequent reviews and approvals by the Town to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval, provided such reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with said original approval. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Town from revoking the original approval for failure to comply with applicable terms and conditions of approval or this Ordinance. Upon revocation, the vesting of rights provided for under this section shall be terminated.

The intent of the Master Plan review is to establish a process limited to Special Use Zoning Districts for considering requests for approval of significant, large or multi-phase projects which may include complex infrastructure improvements, and/or variety of different uses, and/or a variety of different lot or parcel sizes, and/or other features not ordinarily easily addressed in other processes available under this Ordinance. An approved Master Plan provides a framework within which a large project can proceed to more specific plans for all, or one or more smaller portions of, the property included in the Master Plan. An approved Master Plan provides the authorization to install infrastructure only, not the construction of buildings or parking. Typically, a site specific development plan shall be submitted for review and approval of phases or component parts of an approved Master Plan.
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 3: Administrative Procedures
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 3-8
B. APPLICABILITY
An application for a Master Plan may only be filed with an application for rezoning to a special use district for a unified project involving at least twenty (20) acres of land or for the remainder of a site seeking a special use permit involving at least five (5) acres of land.
C. GENERAL STANDARDS/FINDINGS OF FACT
The Town Council shall not approve a Special Use Permit application unless it makes each of the following findings concerning the proposal:
1. The proposal meets the intent of the zoning district being requested;
2. The proposal meets the application criteria for the zoning district being requested; and
3. The proposal contains sufficient detail to guide future Special Use Permit applications that will generally be able to comply with provisions of this Ordinance
D. PROCESS
A Master Plan application shall be processed concurrently with a rezoning request for a Special Use District, and shall be reviewed in accordance with the procedures established by this Ordinance for Zoning Map amendments (Section 3.6). The Planning Board shall make separate recommendations on the rezoning request and the Master Plan. The Town Council shall take separate action on the rezoning request and the Master Plan. If the Town Council denies the rezoning request, the Master Plan application is rendered moot and no further Town Council action is required. Action to approve or deny a Master Plan shall be by resolution and may include reasonable conditions.
E. MASTER PLAN AND VESTED RIGHTS
Approval of a Master Plan establishes a vested right for development of the property consistent with the approved Master Plan, and remains valid for five years.
F. MODIFICATIONS
A Master Plan may be modified through specific Town Council action, following the Zoning Map amendment process, upon the application of the property owner or authorized representative as specified in Section 3.6(N), DEVIATIONS, MODIFICATIONS, REVOCATION, EXPIRATION. Town Council approval of a Special Use Permit that is inconsistent with an approved Master Plan shall be considered to be an amendment to the Master Plan.
G. REVOCATION
An approved Master Plan may be revoked upon action by the Town Council, after notice to the property owner, if the Town Council finds that conditions of approval have not been or are not being satisfied, or that material representations made in the application materials are false or misleading.
H. EXPIRATION OF VESTED RIGHT
The vested right associated with an approved Master Plan shall expire after the period established upon approval as set forth in Section 3.7(E), MASTER PLAN AND VESTED RIGHTS unless improvements have been made to the property in reliance on the approval sufficient to establish common law vested rights. An approved Master Plan that is timely pursued and constructed by the applicant or successors runs with the land.
3.8 SPECIAL USE PERMIT
A. INTENT
Special Uses because of their inherent nature, extent of development, or external effects, require special care in the control of their location, design and methods of operation, in order to insure protection of the public health, safety and welfare. It is the intent of this section to set forth the information to be submitted with applications for Special Use Permits and to state the standards by which each application shall be judged.
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 3: Administrative Procedures
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 3-9
The criteria and procedures established in this section are intended to ensure that the design and construction of site elements include appropriate consideration of the relationship and balance among site elements, the relationship of the proposed development to natural features and neighboring developments, access and circulation systems, mitigation of erosion and sedimentation, mitigation of stormwater drainage and flooding, arrangement and orientation of buildings and amenities in relation to each other and to neighboring development and streets, and mitigation of traffic impacts.
B. APPLICABILITY
An application for a Special Use Permit (SUP) may be submitted when the use is designated Special Use in the Permitted Use Table or in compliance with an approved Master Plan in a Special Use district.
If a Special Use Permit application is submitted simultaneously with a rezoning request to a Special Use District, hearings on both matters shall be held concurrently. The Town Council must act on the rezoning request before it may act on the Special Use Permit application. If the rezoning request is denied, the Special Use Permit application is moot, and no Board action is required on such request.
C. GENERAL STANDARDS/FINDINGS OF FACT
The Town Council shall not approve an application for a Special Use permit unless it makes each of the following findings concerning the proposed special use:
1. That the use or development is located, designed, and proposed to be operated so as to maintain the public health, safety, and general welfare.
2. That the use or development complies with all required regulations and standards of this Ordinance, including all applicable provisions of Chapters 4, 5 and 6 and all applicable regulations;
3. That the use or development is located, designed, and proposed to be operated so as to maintain or enhance the value of contiguous property, or that the use or development is a public necessity; and
4. That the use or development confirms with the general plans for the physical development of the Town as embodied in the Town’s Comprehensive Plan.
D. APPLYING THE ORDINANCE TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARDS TO MAKE FINDINGS OF FACT
1. All of the requirements in this ordinance apply to applications for Special Use Permits.
2. Certain uses require specialized information, which are contained in Section 5, USE STANDARDS. To the extent that any person applies for a Special Use Permit not specifically listed in Section 5, the requirements in Section 5.2(VV),USE REQUIRING SPECIAL USE PERMITS BASED ON THE SIZE, INTENSITY, OR LOCATION OF THE USE shall apply.
3. As Special Uses may have unique characteristics that may not be adequately addressed with development standards for routine uses, an applicant may request a waiver to any provision in Section 6 (excluding Section 6.20, STORMWATER ORDINANCE), together with an explanation of why the waiver or modification is appropriate, including testimony as to why the proposed solution included in the application is equal or superior to the result achieved through the strict application of the provisions in Section 6. The Planning Director, Technical Review Committee, and Planning Board may offer recommendations to the Town Council regarding any requested waiver or modification and the sufficiency of the evidence in support of granting the waiver or modification. Any approval of a Special Use Permit shall specifically detail any and all waiver(s) or modification(s) granted to the applicant.

Stat. § 160A-400.1 et seq, the Town has established an historic overlay district, the purpose and intent of which is to protect the historic and culturally important and significant structures located in the historic district. Consistent with N.C. Gen. Stat. § 160A-400.9, the erection, alteration and improvement of the exterior features of buildings and structures in the historic district may not be undertaken until after an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness for the work has been submitted to and approved by the Historic District Commission.
B. APPLICABILITY
Within the Historic District it shall be unlawful to begin construction, moving, demolition, alteration, or restoration of any structure or site until a Certificate of Appropriateness has been issued.
C. STANDARDS OF EVALUATION
The Commission, in deliberating upon an application, shall consider, among other things, the general scale, design, arrangement, texture, material, and color of the building, structure, or site in question and the relation of such factors to similar features of buildings in the immediate vicinity or buildings of a similar architectural style or age in the Historic District.
The Commission shall not consider the interior arrangement, nor shall it make any requirements except for the purpose of preventing developments which are obviously incongruous to the historic character of the Historic District.
To provide reasonable standards to assist the Commission in its review of design and to guide and limit the discretion of the Commission, the report entitled “Wallace Historic District Commission Guidelines,” as adopted by the Town Council, is hereby adopted and incorporated by reference as part of this Ordinance to guide the review of applications for Certificates of Appropriateness.
D. CERTAIN CHANGES NOT PROHIBITED
Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any architectural feature in the Historic District which does not involve a change in design, material, color, or other appearance nor to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or demolition of any such feature which the County Building Inspector shall certify to the Commission is required for the public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition.
E. PROCEDURE

The maximum period of delay authorized by this section maybe reduced by the Commission based upon a finding that the property owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of beneficial use of or a reasonable return from such property by virtue of the delay.
1. During such period the Commission may negotiate with the owner and with other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the building or site. If the Commission finds that a building or site within the District has no special significance or value toward maintaining the character of the District, it may waive all or part of such period and authorize earlier demolition or removal.
2. If the Commission or Planning Board has voted to recommend the designation of an area as an historic district and final designation has not been made by the Town Council, the demolition or destruction of any building, site, or structure located in the proposed district may be delayed up to 180 days or until the Town Council takes final action on the designation, whichever occurs first.
3. The Town Council may enact an Ordinance to prevent the demolition by neglect of any building or structure within the Historic District. Such Ordinance shall provide appropriate safeguards to protect property owners from undue economic hardship.
4.

4.5 CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICT
A. INTENT
The rezoning of land to a conditional zoning district is intended to provide a landowner and the town an alternative to rezoning the land to a base zoning district, where the base zoning district allows certain uses and development that may be appropriate but also allows uses and development that may not conform to town plans or would have adverse impacts on public facilities or surrounding lands. Reclassification of land to a conditional zoning district allows a landowner to propose, and the Town Council to consider, additional conditions or restrictions on the range of allowable uses, use standards, development intensities, development standards, and other regulations applicable in the parallel base zoning district. This enables the town to tailor a zoning classification to accommodate desirable
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 4: Zoning Districts
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 4-5
development while avoiding or addressing anticipated problems that may arise from development otherwise allowed by the zoning classification.

2. Conditions embodied in a previously-approved Special Use Permit associated with establishment of a Special Use District designation under the previous or current zoning regulations shall continue to apply unless modified in accordance with the procedures and requirements set forth in Section 3.14, CONDITIONAL REZONING.
E. RELATIONSHIP TO OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS
Regulations governing development in an overlay zoning district shall apply in addition to the regulations governing development in the underlying conditional zoning district.

The areas and zones are shown on the town municipal airport zoning map, which is incorporated by reference and made a part hereof. The various zones are established and defined as follows.
1. INSTRUMENT APPROACH ZONE
An instrument approach zone is established at each end of the instrument runway for instrument landings and take-offs. The instrument approach zones shall have a width of 1,000 feet at a distance of 200 feet beyond each end of the runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a distance of 50,200 feet beyond each end of the runway, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
2. NONINSTRUMENT APPROACH ZONE
A noninstrument approach zone is established at each end of all noninstrument runways on the town municipal airport for noninstrument landings and take-offs. The noninstrument approach zone shall have a width of 250 feet at a distance of 200 feet beyond each end of the runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a distance of 10,200 feet beyond each end of the runway, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
3. TRANSITION ZONES
Transition zones are established adjacent to each instrument and noninstrument runway and approach zone as indicated on the zoning map. Transition zones symmetrically located on either side of runways, have variable widths as shown on the zoning map. Transition zones extend outward from a line 125 feet on either side of the center line of the noninstrument runway, for the length of the runway plus 200 feet on each end; and 500 feet on either side of the center line of the instrument runway, for the length of the runway plus 200 feet on each end, and are parallel and level with the runway center lines. The transition

Unified Development Ordinance
Page 4-10
zones along the runways slope upward and outward one foot vertically for each seven feet horizontally to the point where they intersect the surface of the horizontal zone. Further, transition zones are established adjacent to both instrument and noninstrument approach zones for the entire length of the approach zones. These transition zones have variable widths, as shown on the zoning map. The transition zones flare symmetrically with either side of the runway approach zones from the base of the zones and slope upward and outward at the rate of one foot vertically for each seven feet horizontally to the points where they intersect the surfaces of the horizontal and conical zones. Additionally, transition zones are established adjacent to the instrument approach zone where it projects through and beyond the limits of the conical zone, extending a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the instrument approach zones at right angles to the continuation of the center line of the runway.
4. HORIZONTAL ZONE
A horizontal zone is established as the area within a circle with its center at the airport reference point and having a radius of 5,000 feet. The horizontal zone does not include the instrument and noninstrument approach zones and the transition zones.
5. CONICAL ZONE
A conical zone is established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward there from a distance of 3,000 feet. The conical zone does not include the instrument approach zones and transition zones.
C. HEIGHT LIMITATIONS
1. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow or maintained in any zone created by this chapter to a height in excess of the height limit established for the zone. The height limitations are computed from the established airport elevation and are established for each of the zones in question as follows.
a) INSTRUMENT APPROACH ZONE
One foot in height for each 50 feet in horizontal distance beginning at a point 200 feet from the end of the instrument runway and extending to a distance of 10,200 feet from the end of the runway; thence one foot in height for each 40 feet in horizontal distance to a point 50,200 feet from the end of the runway; thence one foot in height for each 40 feet.
b) NONINSTRUMENT APPROACH ZONES
One foot in height for each 40 feet in horizontal distance beginning at a point 200 feet from the end of the noninstrument runway and extending to a point 10,200 feet from the end of the runway.
c) TRANSITION ZONES
One foot in height for each seven feet in horizontal distance beginning at any point 125 feet normal to and at the elevation of the centerline of noninstrument runways extending 200 feet beyond each end thereof, and 500 feet normal to and at the elevation of the centerline of the instrument runway, extending 200 feet beyond each end thereof, extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport elevation which is 37.50 feet above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits of one foot vertical height for each seven feet horizontal distance measured from the edges of all approach zones for the entire length of the approach zones and extending upward and outward to the points where they intersect the horizontal or conical surfaces. Further, where the instrument approach zone projects through and beyond the conical zone, a height limit of one foot for each seven feet of horizontal distance shall be maintained beginning at the edge of the instrument approach zone and extending a distance of 5,000 feet from the edge of the instrument approach zone measured normal to the centerline of the runway extended.
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 4: Zoning Districts

Page 4-11
d) HORIZONTAL ZONE
One hundred fifty feet above the airport elevation or a height of 187.50 feet above mean sea level.
e) CONICAL ZONE
One foot in height for each 20 feet of horizontal distance beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone, extending to a height of 337.3 feet above the airport elevation.
2. Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the more restrictive limitation shall prevail.
3. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting the growth, construction or maintenance of any tree or structure to a height up to 45 feet above the surface of the land.
D. USE RESTRICTIONS
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use may be made of land within any zone established by this chapter in such a manner as to create electrical interference with radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for flyers to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the flyers using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport or otherwise endanger the landing, taking-off and maneuvering of aircraft.
E. NONCONFORMING USES
1. REGULATIONS NOT RETROACTIVE
The regulations prescribed by this chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other changes or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this chapter, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require and change in the construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this chapter, and is diligently prosecuted.
2. MARKING AND LIGHTING
Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this section, the owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon of the markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the airport engineers, to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport, the presence of the airport hazards. The markers and lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the town.
F. PERMITS
1. FUTURE USES
a) Except as specifically provided in Subsections (i-iii) hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted or otherwise established in any zone created unless a permit therefore shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If the determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted.
i) In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and the conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when because of terrain, land contour or topographic features the tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for the zone.
ii) In areas lying within the limits of the instrument and noninstrument approach zones but at a horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runways, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground except when the tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for the instrument or noninstrument approach zone.
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 4: Zoning Districts
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 4-12
iii) In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground except when the tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features would extend above the height limit prescribed for the transition zones.
b) Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration or growth of any structure or tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this chapter, except as set forth in Section 4.8(C), HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.
2. EXISTING USES
No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on the effective date of this chapter or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted.
3. NONCONFORMING USES ABANDONED OR DESTROYED
Wherever the Town Council determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than 80% torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow the structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
4. VARIANCES
Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his or her property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the Board of Adjustment for a variance from the regulations. The variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest, but will do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this chapter.
5. HAZARD MARKING AND LIGHTING
Any permit or variance granted may, if the action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the town at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain thereon the markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard.
G. ENFORCEMENT
It shall be the duty of the Planning Director to administer and enforce the regulations prescribed herein. Applications for permits and variances shall be made to the Planning Director upon a form furnished by him or her. Applications required by this chapter to be submitted to the Planning Director shall be promptly considered and granted or denied by him or her. Applications for action by the Board of Adjustment shall be forthwith transmitted by the Planning Director.

4.9 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
A. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
1. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of Chapter 143; Parts 3, 5, and 8 of Article 19 of Chapter 160A; and Article 8 of Chapter 160A of the North Carolina General Statutes, delegated to local governmental the responsibility units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
2. FINDINGS OF FACT
(a) The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of Wallace are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(b) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
3. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:
(a) restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
(b) require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 4: Zoning Districts
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 4-14
(c) control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
(d) control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage; and
(e) prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
4. OBJECTIVES
The objectives of this chapter are:
(a) to protect human life and health;
(b) to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(c) to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(d) to minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
(e) to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;
(f) to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas; and
(g) to ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a Special Flood Hazard Area.

2. SPECIFIC STANDARDS
In all Special Flood Hazard Areas where Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data has been provided, as set forth in Section 4.9(C)(2), the following provisions, in addition to Section 4.9(E)(1), are required:
(a) RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in Section 4.9(B) of this ordinance.
(b) NON-RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in Section 4.9(B) of this ordinance. Structures located in A, AE and A1-30 Zones may be floodproofed to the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AO Zones, the floodproofing elevation shall be in accordance with Section 4.9(E)(8)(c). A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in Section 4.9(D)(2)(c), along with the operational and maintenance plans..
(c) MANUFACTURED HOMES
i. New or replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in Section 4.9(B) of this ordinance.
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 4: Zoning Districts
Unified Development Ordinance

(e) Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions; and
(g) Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above.
(e) ADDITIONS/IMPROVEMENTS
i. Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to the existing structure are:
(a) not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more non-conforming than the existing structure.
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 4: Zoning Districts
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 4-27
(b) a substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new construction.
ii. Additions to post-FIRM structures with no modifications to the existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall shall require only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction.
iii. Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to the existing structure are:

(b) a substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new construction.
iv. Where an independent perimeter load-bearing wall is provided between the addition and the existing building, the addition(s) shall be considered a separate building and only the addition must comply with the standards for new construction.
(f) RECREATIONAL VEHICLES. Recreational vehicles shall either:
i. be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities, and has no permanently attached additions); or
(g) ACCESSORY STRUCTURES. When accessory structures (sheds, detached garages, etc.) are to be placed within a Special Flood Hazard Area, the following criteria shall be met:
i. Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation (including working, sleeping, living, cooking or restroom areas);
ii. Accessory structures shall not be temperature-controlled;
iii. Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood damage potential;
iv. Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters;
v. Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored in accordance with Section 4.9(E)(1)(a);
vi. All service facilities such as electrical shall be installed in accordance with Section 4.9(E)(1)(d); and
vii. Flood openings to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces shall be provided below regulatory flood protection elevation in conformance with Section 4.9(E)(2)(d)(iii).
An accessory structure with a footprint less than 150 square feet that satisfies the criteria outlined above does not require an elevation or floodproofing certificate. Elevation or floodproofing certifications are required for all other accessory structures in accordance with Section 4.9(D)(2)(c).
3. RESERVED
4. FLOODWAYS AND NON-ENCROACHMENT AREAS
Areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas are located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Section 4.9(C)(2). The floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris and potential projectiles. The following provisions, in addition to standards outlined in Section 4.9(E)(1 & 2), shall apply to all development within such areas:
(a) No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated that:
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 4: Zoning Districts
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 4-28
i. the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice and presented to the floodplain administrator prior to issuance of floodplain development permit, or
ii. a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) has been approved by FEMA. A Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) must also be obtained upon completion of the proposed encroachment.
(b) If Section 4.9(E)(6)(a) is satisfied, all development shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this ordinance.
(c) No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except replacement manufactured homes in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, provided the following provisions are met:
i. the anchoring and the elevation standards of Section 4.9(E)(2)(c); and

Chapter 6 – Development Standards 6.1 PURPOSE AND INTENT The general intent of this section is to provide standards for development to help ensure the safe and convenient development of land on sites and in locations adequate for the uses proposed. No Zoning Compliance Permit or Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued for uses of land, structures and/or buildings, or for a change in the use, unless
the requirements of this Chapter are met. The standards set forth in this section are to be used in conjunction with the other sections of this Ordinance in the development of projects and submittal of site plans. 6.2 DESIGN STANDARDS MANUAL The Town of Wallace’s Design Manual provides design standards additional to the requirements of this Ordinance and tailored specific to overlay districts. This Manual is intended to supplement, and not as a substitute for, this Ordinance. 6.3 GENERAL DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS The following section includes dimensional standards for both residential and non-residential zoning districts. These
general dimensional standards apply to all properties unless otherwise specified in this Ordinance or by the permit-
issuing authority. There Are Two Tables In This Section: 1. Table 6.3.1: DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL ZONING DISTRICTS includes a summary table that specifies
the area, maximum height, and yard setbacks for each of the respective types of residential and non-residential
zoning districts 2. Table 6.3.2: SIDE AND REAR SETBACK FOR LOTS ABUTTING A DIFFERENT ZONING DISTRICT includes a summary
table that specifies yard setbacks for lots when the adjacent property is of a different zoning district. 6.3.1 TABLE: DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL ZONING DISTRICTS

A. Bona fide farm operations in the AR district are exempt from the side yard and rear yard setback requirements
provided (a) the bona fide farm is a lot or parcel located outside the corporate limits of Wallace (i.e., is in the extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction, and (b) the lot line with respect to which the setback exemption is sought lies
adjacent to other property zoned AR or to property outside Wallace’s zoning jurisdiction.
6.4 AIR POLLUTION A. PURPOSE AND INTENT It is the intent of this section to protect and promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by regulating air pollution and contaminants in order to provide clean air. Any permitted principal use, Special Use, or accessory use
that emits any “air contaminant” as defined in N.C. Gen. Stat. § 143-213, shall comply with applicable State of North Carolina standards concerning air pollution, as set forth in Article 21B of Chapter 143 of the North Carolina General
Statutes. B. STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS No Zoning Compliance Permit shall be issued with respect to any development emitting an "air contaminant" until the NC Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Division of Air Quality, has certified to the Planning
Director that the appropriate State permits have been received by the applicant (as provided in G.S. 143-215.108) or that the applicant will be eligible to receive such permits and that the development is otherwise in compliance with applicable air pollution control regulations. If a State permit is required, but has not yet been approved at the time the Town is about to issue a Zoning Compliance, the Town’s Zoning Compliance shall be issued subject to a condition that no CO may be issued until the State permit has been issued. 6.5 BUFFERS A. PURPOSE AND INTENT It is the intent of this section to protect and promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by regulating the spacing of adjacent land uses. Buffers are required where differences in adjacent zoning designations suggest that spatial separation is necessary to offset potential adverse impacts of adjacent uses. Screening requirements to mitigate the impacts of specific activities like parking or solid waste storage are addressed in Section 6.16, SCREENING. B. APPLICABILITY Buffers will be required consistent with Figure 6-1, TYPES OF BUFFERS and Figure 6-2, REQUIRED BUFFER
PLACEMENT and Section 6.5(D), REQUIREMENTS. Buffers will generally be established at the earliest review phase, but may be amended at the time of an individual parcel development if the circumstances have changed. C. BUFFER TYPES
1. Type A buffers shall be a minimum of 20 feet wide and shall provide intermittent visual obstructions from the ground to a height of at least 15 feet. Plant material, sizes, and planting pattern options are included in the Administrative Manual. 2. Type B buffers shall be a minimum of 40 feet wide and shall provide a visual barrier from the ground to a height of 6 feet and intermittent visual obstructions to a height of at least 20 feet. The 6 foot portion of the barrier is
not required to be 100% opaque year round, but shall provide significant visual separation between the adjoining uses and shall deter pedestrian access. Plant material, sizes, and planting pattern options are included in the Administrative Manual. 3. Type C buffers shall be a minimum of 60 feet wide and shall provide complete visual separation from the ground to a height of 10 feet upon plant maturity, shall be opaque year round, and shall deter pedestrian access. Plant material, sizes, and planting pattern options are included in the Administrative Manual.
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 6: Development Standards
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 6-4
D. REQUIREMENTS
1. Buffers shall be provided as set forth in Table 6.5.1, REQUIRED BUFFERS. The permit-issuing authority may require a greater or lesser buffer type or include supplemental standards if during the review of the application a different standard is clearly indicated. 2. When the parcel adjacent to the parcel being developed is vacant, the permit-issuing authority may reduce the buffer by 50% if the current zoning or future land use designation on the adjacent vacant parcel indicates that a similar buffer would be required on the adjacent vacant parcel when it develops. 3. When a parcel zoned for residential use is to be developed adjacent to an Interstate or railroad right of way, a 100 foot undisturbed buffer shall be provided along the adjacent property line, regardless of the requirement in Table 6.5.1, REQUIRED BUFFERS. This buffer shall be planted to meet the standard of a Type C buffer if the existing vegetation does not meet that standard. 4. When a non-residential parcel is adjacent to a street classified as arterial or collector, no buffer shall be required along the street frontage, regardless of the requirement in Table 6.5.1, REQUIRED BUFFERS, unless
modified by the permit-issuing authority. E. OPTIONS
1. The permit-issuing authority may consider buffers that include a combination of existing plant material, newly
planted material, constructed walls or fences, berms, and grade changes in cases where the applicant can demonstrate that the proposed alternative buffer will be at least as effective as the type buffer required. 2. The Administrative Manual provides drawings and examples to guide staff in determining the sufficiency of
existing landscaping. F. OWNERSHIP OF BUFFERS 1. No required buffer in a residential development shall be included within any single family lot, or be wholly
owned (in fee simple absolute) by the owner of an individual residential building lot zoned for residential uses.
Buffers in residential developments shall be owned by a homeowner’s association or other entity charged with its preservation and the preservation of existing landscaping. 2. The required buffer for a non-residential, multi-family or mixed use site may be owned by a property owner’s
association or by the property owner. Figure 6-1: TYPES OF BUFFERS
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 6: Development Standards
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 6-5
G. DEVELOPMENT WITHIN REQUIRED BUFFER 1. The required buffer shall not contain any development, impervious surfaces, or site features that do not function to meet the standards of this section or that require removal of existing vegetation, unless otherwise permitted by this Ordinance. 2. No grading, development, or land-disturbing activities shall occur within the buffer or within the tree protection area unless approved by the permit issuing authority. 3. Sidewalks, walkways, trails and fences may be placed in buffers provided that damage to existing vegetation is
minimized. 4. Utilities are not permitted in buffers unless no reasonable alternative exists. 5. If utilities are placed in a buffer, they shall be located and installed in a way that minimizes disturbance of the buffer area. Utility lines may not run parallel to and within required buffers, but may cross required buffers as near to perpendicular an angle as possible, and in any event at no less than a 60° angle. If utilities, stormwater drainage channels or piping, and other similar features are placed in a buffer any way other than perpendicular or not less than at a 60 degree angle, the area making up the utility easement or area shall be replaced with an equal amount of buffer area. No canopy trees may be removed for utility installation unless no reasonable alternative exists. 6. Stormwater BMPs and impoundments may be placed within a required buffer only when the applicant demonstrates that no reasonably practicable alternative exists, and provided that the performance standard of
the buffer can be maintained. Bioretention areas may be placed within buffers without additional justification provided the performance standard of the buffer is maintained. H. MAINTENANCE OF BUFFERS 1. Where a buffer is owned by a property owners association, the covenants for the development shall require that association to maintain the buffers and shall include a buffer maintenance plan. 2. For parcels that contain a buffer as part of a permit requirement, the property owner shall maintain the buffer.
The site will be inspected at the end of the second growing season following permit issuance for compliance and during any subsequent development review to ensure continued compliance. Figure 6-2: REQUIRED BUFFER PLACEMENT

6.6 CREATION OF NEW BUILDING LOTS A. PURPOSE AND INTENT It is the intent of this section to protect and promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by regulating the creation of new building lots in order to protect and preserve the appearance, character, and value of adjacent properties. B. APPLICABILITY All new residential and non-residential lots must meet the following requirements. C. NEW LOT REQUIREMENTS 1. New lots shall generally have four sides and generally not have more than 8 sides to facilitate the enforcement of setback requirements and ensure that each lot is generally usable for its intended building proposed, unless
existing topographic or natural features such as a stream or ridgeline acts as a boundary. 2. New building lots shall not have appendages less than twenty (20 ) feet in width and more than twenty (20)
feet in length created to provide street access or to enable the lot to meet minimum lot size or frontage requirements. 3. Lots in residential zoning districts must have at least thirty (30) feet of frontage on a public or private street the lot uses for access. 4. Unless otherwise approved by the permit issuing authority, all lots shall meet the lot width requirement specified in Section 6.3, GENERAL DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS at the front setback line. The permit issuing
authority may waive this requirement during review of a Special Use Permit for a development after consideration of lot depth, lot width, general usability of the building envelop on the parcel, and compatibility
of the proposed lots with existing and proposed neighboring lots. 6.5.1 Table: REQUIRED BUFFERS

D. USABILITY OF LOTS 1. New lots created for building purposes must contain a buildable area at least 10 feet wide and at least 10 feet deep after application of setbacks requirements. 2. No new lot shall be created for building purposes that contains an area wholly within the required setbacks of
opposing lot sides. E. DIVERSITY IN SINGLE FAMILY DETACHED HOME NEIGHBORHOODS In an effort to prevent monotonous and sterile built environments in areas containing single family detached dwellings, and to mimic the diverse character of many residential neighborhoods in the planning jurisdiction, variability of lot widths and lot sizes within new developments is encouraged. 1. Single family detached home developments containing 20 or more lots must have at least 3 different lot widths
on each straight street section (may be multiple blocks) longer than 400 feet. Contiguous lot widths must vary
by at least 10 feet to meet this standard. 2. Single family detached home developments containing 20 or more lots may provide an equal number of lots
10% smaller than the minimum lot size for each lot proposed that is 30% or more larger than the minimum lot size.
3. Single family detached home developments requiring a Special Use Permit may include lots up to 10’ narrower than the district minimum standard and/or 10% smaller than the district minimum standard to meet the diversity standard established above and to maximize lot diversity, provided, however, that the average lot width and acreage lot area in the development must meet the district minimum standards. 6.7 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL NEW NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS A. PURPOSE AND INTENT It is the intent of this section to protect and promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by regulating the appearance of non-residential construction in order to protect and preserve the appearance, character, and value of
adjacent properties. Where existing conditions such as limited visibility of the building or features make satisfying
these requirements unnecessary or non-compliance with the design requirements achieves another town goal, the permit-issuing authority may modify the requirements based on competent evidence provided by the applicant to establish that alternatives provided by the applicant will satisfy the purpose and intent of the design requirements, and will protect the use, enjoyment and value of adjoining properties. B. APPLICABILITY All new non-residential buildings must meet the following general principles. C. ARTICULATION 1. The facade shall be articulated with design features or employ a level of architectural detailing sufficient to ensure visual interest and promote pedestrian scale 2.

Excessive variation of façade planes, roof pitches, and building
materials on an individual structure is discouraged. 6.9 DRIVEWAY CONNECTIONS A. PURPOSE AND INTENT It is the intent of this section to protect and promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by requiring that driveways shall be designed and located so as to minimize the number of conflict points among vehicular movements, to coordinate the location and the alignment of major driveway connections (ingress to or egress from
heavy traffic generators such as shopping centers and supermarkets) and roadway intersections on opposite sides of
the intersected street, to discourage dangerous vehicular movements, to minimize conflicts with pedestrian traffic, to avoid driveway connections at locations where adequate, safe sight distances cannot be provided, and to ensure driveway connections are designed to accommodate storm water runoff. The use of cross access easements
connecting independent, adjacent developments is encouraged, so as to reduce the number of driveway curb cuts
to the public right-of-way. B. APPLICABILITY These requirements shall apply to all development types, except one and two-family dwellings. Figure 6-4: DRIVEWAY CONNECTIONS C. DRIVEWAY REQUIREMENTS 1. No driveway shall be located within two hundred fifty (250) feet of the intersection of a public street with an arterial or collector street unless no other site access is legally practicable. 2. No drive shall be located closer than twenty-five (25) feet to the right-of-way of any local street intersection. At intersections with traffic signals, the Planning Director shall specify distances from the right-of-way to allow for sufficient stacking of vehicles in the street prior to the driveway location.
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 6: Development Standards
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 6-12
3. When access is available to a lot from streets of different classifications (e.g., arterial, collector, sub-collector), the driveway will be located so as to provide access to the lot from the street with the lower classification. 4. In parking lots where large hourly volumes of entering traffic may be expected, the developer shall provide a setback between pavement edge of the public roadway and the edge of proposed internal drives to accommodate stacking within the parking lot. This setback shall be determined by the Planning Director based on standards required by NCDOT, the Institute of Traffic Engineers, or other recognized standard. 5. On curb and gutter streets, the North Carolina Department of Transportation standard concrete driveway ramp shall be used. The Planning Director may allow street type driveway entrances for high volume traffic uses. 6. Driveway connections shall be designed to accommodate stormwater to ensure that gravel does not wash into the public street. Connections which are above the grade of the existing street shall be graded so that drainage is directed into ditches designed to accommodate the drainage, or into the street gutters. The driveway shall be at the same elevation as the existing street across the width of the street right-of-way. If gravel or other materials wash onto the public street, the property owner shall be responsible to remove the material and establish safe conditions. 7. Driveways shall be a minimum of one hundred feet (100') apart when access is to a collector or arterial street. 8. Driveways shall be clearly defined with the use of curbs and/or landscaping. 9. Driveways on opposite sides of the street shall either be offset by at least fifty feet (50') or aligned, unless such standards cannot be met for safety reasons. 6.10 LANDSCAPING (PARKING LOT) A. PURPOSE AND INTENT It is the intent of this section to protect and promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by requiring the landscaping of parking areas in order to reduce radiant heat from surfaces, reduce glare of automobile lights, minimize stormwater and drainage problems, and protect and preserve the appearance, character, and value of
adjacent properties. Where existing conditions such as topography, structures, or other existing features make satisfying these requirements impractical, the permit-issuing authority may modify the requirements based on competent evidence provided by the applicant to establish that alternatives provided by the applicant will satisfy
the purpose and intent of the buffer and landscape requirements, and will protect the use, enjoyment and value of
adjoining properties. B. APPLICABILITY These requirements shall apply to all development types with the exception of one and two family dwellings. C. LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS 1. Parking lots shall contain at least 1 shade tree for every seven parking spaces required for the site. These trees
shall be located a sufficient distance from existing overhead utility lines to ensure the health and growth of the tree. 2. Trees shall be evenly distributed throughout the parking areas and parking perimeter at the required ratio. 3. No more than 14 continuous parking spaces shall be allowed without a minimum of 1 landscape island containing a shade tree.
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 6: Development Standards
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 6-13
4. All planting medians or islands in parking lots shall be at least 100 square feet measured from back of curb to back of curb (or pavement edge if the island is not curbed for stormwater purposes). When an island contains
one or more shade trees, the island must have at least 300 square feet of unpaved space per shade tree. 5. Linear planting strips between the lengths of parking isles are encouraged rather than numerous small tree islands. If a linear strip is used, 15 shrubs (no taller than 3 feet at maturity) per 100 feet of planting strip must be planted in addition to the required trees. 6. A minimum 10 foot wide continuous planted median shall be installed in off-street parking areas for every 2
double loaded parking bays exceeding 122 feet in length. Alternative landscaping layouts and arrangements
which similarly visually break up large parking areas will be considered by the permit issuing authority. 7. Parking facilities, unless located on or within a structure, shall be separated from the exterior wall of a structure by a landscaped area at least five (5) feet in width; 8. Ground level parking facilities and the ground level of multi-level parking structures shall be screened from
adjacent residential areas and streets by means of opaque landscaping, fencing, or grade change of at least three (3) feet in height above the grade of the edge of the parking area; 9. In meeting these standards, the retention of existing significant vegetation shall be encouraged. The site plan submitted shall locate and identify all existing and proposed trees and shrubs used for parking standards. 10. Landscaping and walkways shall be installed to indicate the preferred travel pattern for pedestrians. 11. Landscaping shall be protected from damage by motor vehicles. 12. The permit issuing authority may modify requirements of this section based on the specific needs of the location as long as they are consistent with the regulations set forth in this section.

6.11 LIGHTING A. PURPOSE AND INTENT It is the intent of this section to protect and promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by establishing
criteria and standards for providing uniform lighting in outdoor public places where safety and security are concerns, protecting drivers and pedestrians from disabling glare from non-vehicular light sources that shine directly
into their eyes and thereby impair safe traverse, protecting neighbors from nuisance glare from poorly aimed or inadequately shielded light sources, and providing lighting which is efficient and compatible with surrounding uses
and structures. B. APPLICABILITY Lighting plans shall demonstrate that sufficient light will be available to provide security for property and people using public facilities and common areas after dark. This includes, but is not limited to, roads, driveways, walkways, bikeways, parking lots, and recreational areas. Lighting plans will be reviewed as part of the review process for all permit applications. Modifications to approved or existing lighting shall be submitted to the Planning Director for review and compliance with applicable requirements. C. LIGHTING REQUIREMENTS Lighting plans shall include a layout of proposed fixture locations (including wall mounted lights, ground mounted lights, and illuminated signs), foot candle data that demonstrate conforming intensities and uniformities; and a description of the equipment (catalog cuts), glare control devices, lamps, mounting heights and means, hours of
operation, and maintenance methods proposed. Illumination intensities (lighting contours) may be shown on an independent plan or integrated with other required plans D. MINIMUM LIGHT LEVELS 1. Parking areas, whether surface or in a structure, shall have a minimum light intensity of 1.0 footcandles. 2. Interior sidewalks, those sidewalks that connect buildings to parking areas, common areas, of facilities within a development that are likely to be used at night, shall have a minimum light intensity of 0.5 footcandles. 3. Minimum lighting levels in this subsection are not required to be met by nonresidential uses during non-
business hours. E. MAXIMUM LIGHT LEVELS 1. All outdoor lighting shall be designed and located such that the maximum illumination measured in foot candles at the light source’s property line shall not exceed two tenths (0.2) foot candle measured at ground level. 2. Light intensities shall not exceed fifteen (15) foot-candles at any location on the site to limit glare and blinding
caused by significant light variations across a site. The permit issuing authority may consider an applicant’s
unique situations and use requirements during the development review and may allow greater intensities
within the site. F. INSTALLATION 1. Lighting fixtures height shall not exceed the lesser of the maximum permitted building height for the district, or the maximum height of the main portion of the primary building on the site (excluding spires, towers, parapet walls and the like) on the site. For sites where no building is proposed, mounting height for fixtures shall not exceed fifteen (15) feet for non-cutoff type fixtures or twenty-five (25) feet for cut-off type fixtures. This
provision shall not apply to outdoor athletic field and outdoor performance area lighting provided the other applicable requirements of this section are met.
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 6: Development Standards
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 6-15
2. Electrical feeds to lighting standards shall be run underground, not overhead. 3. Lighting standards in parking areas shall be protected from vehicle impact with protective barriers or by
location. Standards should not be placed so as to obstruct pedestrian movement along sidewalks or medians. 4. Directional lighting fixtures used for sign lighting shall be top mounted so lighting is aimed down. Ground mounted signs with a height of five (5) feet or less may be ground lit, provided that the lights are shielded so as
to illuminate the sign only, and the light shall not exceed 10 foot-candles at the sign surface. 5. Fixtures shall be of the sharp cut-off type. No portion of the fixture bulb may extend below the fixture housing.
Non-cutoff type fixtures may be used if approved by the permit issuing authority with good cause shown during
the permit review and such fixtures meet the other standards of this section. 6. Unshielded wall fixtures shall not be used as security or general lighting adjacent to residential uses or to a public right of way. 7. Landscape plantings shall be located and maintained so that they do not block light from reaching the intended surfaces. 8. The placement of light fixtures should indicate the desired traffic flow and aid pedestrian safety, especially in areas with potential conflict between pedestrians and vehicles. Figure 6-6: EXTERIOR LIGHTING REQUIREMENTS G. CONTROL OF NUISANCE AND DISABLING GLARE 1. All outdoor lighting, shall be designed, installed and maintained in a manner which does not present a disabling
glare hazard to drivers or pedestrians; and all reasonable means shall be taken to prevent projection of
nuisance glare onto neighboring properties or into the night sky. 2. Lighting for sports and athletic fields must include glare control features and must be designed so that primary
illumination is directed onto the play area and ancillary areas such as bleachers, stands, and similar areas. All lighting fixtures for sports fields must be equipped with a glare control package including louvers, shields, or similar devices. The fixtures must be aimed so that their beams are directed and fall within the primary playing
or performance area.
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 6: Development Standards
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 6-16
3. Non-security lighting shall be extinguished when the operation is closed or not in use. In reviewing lighting
plans, the permit issuing authority may consider the impact of lighting on neighboring properties based on stated hours of operation, topographical differences across sites, and other considerations. 4. Glare control shall be accomplished primarily through the proper selection and application of lighting
equipment and shielding. Only after those means have been exhausted shall vegetation, fences, or similar buffer methods be considered for reducing glare. H. MAINTENANCE
1. Lighting fixtures used for safety and security lighting shall be maintained in proper working order so as to always meet the requirements of this Ordinance. 6.12 MOBILE HOME PARKS A.

USE PERMIT; TEMPORARY OPERATING PERMIT REQUIRED. 2. The park owner must submit a compliance plan to the Planning Director not later than 60 days prior to the expiration date of the temporary operating permit in order to apply for a special use permit. This plan shall be reviewed by the Planning Board and Council and shall become a condition to the special use, if granted. The park owner shall choose one of three alternatives as follows. (a) If no compliance plan is submitted, the park owner shall be considered to have chosen not to comply
with both the design and operating standards as described in Section 6.12(B), DESIGN STANDARDS and Section 6.12(E), OPERATING STANDARDS or with the operating standards only and does not seek a special use permit. In this case the owner has chosen the alternative of ceasing operation upon the expiration date of his or her temporary operating permit.
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 6: Development Standards
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 6-22
(b) If the compliance plan shows adherence to only the operating standards as described in Section 6.12(E), OPERATING STANDARDS, the park owner is deemed to wish a special use permit to operate under those standards. This permit may be issued by the Town Council for a period of two years, but cannot be renewed more than twice, for a total of six years. At the end of this period the park must close. The park owner may change his or her mind and submit a plan for conformance to both design and operating standards and apply for a permit as provided for in Section 6.12(F)(2)(c) below. A permit must be granted before the special use permit issued under this section has expired.
(c) If the park owner wishes to continue operation indefinitely, the compliance plan must not only
indicate observance of the operating standards, but must indicate how the park plans to comply with the design standards as set forth in Section 6.12(B), DESIGN STANDARDS with the following
exceptions: i. Requirements in Sections 6.12(B)(1), 6.12(B)(2), 6.12(B)(7) and 6.12(B)(14) are eliminated entirely;
ii. Requirements in Section 6.12(B)(4), the requirement of paved walkways is eliminated; iii. Requirements in Section 6.12(B)(5), the dimensions may be reduced by 50%; iv. Requirements in Section 6.12(B)(9), the requirement that the private roads be hard-surfaced is eliminated; v. Requirements in Section 6.12(B)(16), the Type B Buffer may be reduced to a ten (10) foot planting strip adjacent to the park boundary extending along the entire perimeter of the mobile home park. It shall be planted with evergreen or deciduous trees not more than twenty (20) feet apart and adequately landscaped with grass and shrubbery in such a manner as to be harmonious with the landscaping of the adjacent properties and in keeping
with the general character of the surrounding neighborhood. The park owner may use
existing vegetation and trees that are located along the park perimeter to satisfy this
requirement as long as it meets or exceeds that required spacing and tree type as specified above. A planting strip shall not be required in areas where it conflicts with currently
existing public utilities as determined by the Planning Director and the Public Works Director.
The planting strip must be planted and maintained according to any current or future town policies; vi. Requirements in Section 6.12(B)(17), the requirement of installing wiring underground is
eliminated. The park need not connect to city water and sewage systems, but if it does not the park owner must obtain a letter or certificate from the County Health Department stating that the water supply or sewage disposal system has the approval of the Health Department to continue in operation; vii. Requirements in Section 6.12(B)(18), the recreational space requirements may be reduced to one area of 5,000 square feet. This area need not be oriented toward children if the park consists primarily of retired couples or individuals; and viii. Requirements in Section 6.12(B)(19), the location of an already existing building shall not be regulated. (d) The compliance plan submitted under this third alternative must include a map showing the same information required of a park plan Section 6.12(D)(8). It must show how this new plan differs from
the present park and it must include a yearly time table indicating completion of the plan within three years. 3. In no case shall a mobile home, which has been removed for any reason, be replaced unless and until a compliance plan for the non-conforming park has been approved by the Council as provided for in Section 6.12(F)(2)(c) above. 4. If, at any future time, a nonconforming mobile home park wishes to expand in total size or in number of mobile homes, the owner must obtain a new special use permit with the requirement that the new section be brought into complete compliance with all standards. (a) The old nonconforming section may continue with a nonconforming status, as herein provided.

6.13 OPEN SPACE A. PURPOSE AND INTENT It is the intent of this section to protect and promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by requiring the dedication of a portion of land for the purpose of preserving open space and the protection of significant natural
features and/or cultural resources. B. APPLICABILITY Every applicant for a Special Use Permit or Master Plan for residential and/or non-residential purposes involving the creation of multiple lots from a parent parcel shall be required to dedicate a portion of the parcel for the purpose of
preserving open space, and to preserve significant natural features and/or cultural resources. C. DEDICATION REQUIREMENTS 1. The applicant shall provide land for open space within the proposed development equal to 10% of the gross
parcel (development tract) area unless the development is a Conservation Subdivision, in which case the requirement is 35% of the gross parcel (development tract). 2. Open space shall be accessible to all lots in the development through a combination of direct access to the street and sidewalks, walkways or connecting paths. Figure 6-7: OPEN SPACE ILLUSTRATIONS D. PERMITTED USES WITHIN OPEN SPACE: 1. Buffers required in Section 6.5, BUFFERS 2. Undeveloped land without a designated purpose held by a property owners association or non-profit conservation entity E. PROHIBITED USES WITHIN OPEN SPACE: 1. Stormwater management ponds, swales, conveyances, and treatment areas 2. Recreation space 3. Reserved rights of way 4. Utility, drainage, or access easements 6. Any land held in private ownership rather than commonly held by a property owners association or non-profit conservation entity
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 6: Development Standards
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 6-24
F. ADDITIONAL PERMITTED USES WITHIN OPEN SPACE AREAS 1. Open space has no purpose that requires the construction of structures or modification of the existing
landscape or grade. An applicant may propose fences, community gardens, and passive uses including walking
trails, available to the public or restricted to occupants of the development, at the time of development review.
The applicant shall construct any trails proposed, which may count toward a recreational requirement in Section 6.16, Recreation Sites. 2. Utility easements may cross common open space if necessary to connect to the area network. To the maximum
extent practicable, utility easement intersections with open space shall be perpendicular to minimize land disturbance. In no case shall a utility easement run coincident with an area of common open space for a length of more than 50 feet without specific authorization by the permit issuing authority and a plan for mitigating the impact of the disturbance on the intent of the open space. 3. Design Requirements All residential developments shall provide walkways connecting residences and open or common areas. This
may be accomplished with sidewalks along street frontages or walkways through recorded access or utility
easements. G. LAND CHARACTERISTICS 1. To prevent open space from becoming a nuisance, all open space within a development shall be accessible from
a public right of way. 2. Open space shall be arranged to have both contiguity and connectivity within the development dedicating the open space and to any surrounding dedicated open space. For the purposes of this paragraph, contiguity shall
mean that the parcel being offered as open space is of sufficient area to be meaningful in achieving the intent of open space and connectivity shall mean that the parcel being offered as open space shall be located so that a person or wildlife can move between open space parcels without traveling across private property or along a
public road or sidewalk. 6.14 PARKING, LOADING, AND CIRCULATION A. PURPOSE AND INTENT It is the general purpose and intent of this section to provide for off-street parking and loading areas that are safe, convenient and of adequate size for the particular use or uses proposed. No Zoning Compliance Permit or Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued for uses of land, structures, and buildings, either initially, or for a change in use, or expansion of an existing use, unless the off-street parking and loading requirements of this section are met. B. APPLICABILITY The requirements of this section apply to all developments, regardless of zoning designation, with the exception of
one and two family detached houses. C. OFF-STREET PARKING PROVISIONS 1. GENERAL
Each of the following uses shall provide off-street parking spaces in accordance with the table below; except for properties located in CB District as detailed in Section 6.14(C)(2), MINIMUM NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES REQUIRED IN THE CB DISTRICT. The term "per employee" shall mean per employee at the time the maximum
number of employees are present. 2. MINIMUM NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES REQUIRED IN THE CB DISTRICT Due to the presence of on-street and off-street public parking and the overlapping and walkable nature of areas zoned Central Business, the requirement of parking applies by square feet of building within the entire Central
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 6: Development Standards
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 6-25
Business district rather than use by use. For every 500 square feet of gross floor area within the CB district, one parking space shall be provided. 3. MINIMUM NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES REQUIRED OUTSIDE THE CB DISTRICT The following Table establishes the formulas to be used to calculate the number of parking spaces required for a particular use. If no specific parking standard is established in this Table for a particular use, the permit issuing
authority shall apply the most analogous standard. Some uses identified in this Table are not identified the Table of Permitted Uses as specific uses. Nevertheless, parking standards for the most similar use shall apply. 4. PARKING PROVISIONS FOR USES NOT SPECIFICALLY LISTED Any use not listed specifically in Table 6.14.1, MINIMUM NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES REQUIRED shall meet the off-street parking and loading requirements determined by the permit-issuing authority. In making the determination, the permit-issuing authority shall use the standards as set forth in Table 6.14.1, MINIMUM NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES REQUIRED for those uses which they find most similar to the proposed use. D. JOINT PARKING FACILITIES 1. The required parking for multiple, separate and complementary uses located in any zoning districts may be combined in one lot, subject to the following requirements: (a) The off-street parking spaces allotted to each use shall be shown on the application for a Zoning
Compliance Permit; (b) The distance between the primary entrance of the structure housing the use to be served and the farthest allotted parking space for that use shall not exceed one thousand three hundred twenty
(1,320) feet. (c) Spaces assigned to one use may not be assigned to another use at the same time or any other time, except that upon the presentation of competent evidence demonstrating the adequacy of shared parking facilities, up to one-half of the parking spaces required for uses such as, but not limited to, churches, theatres, and assembly halls, the peak attendance at which is expected to be outside typical
business hours (Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.) may be assigned to another use which will
experience peak usage during the day. The Planning Director shall make the determination relative to peak usages. (d) Cross easements shall be executed and recorded at the Duplin County Register of Deeds to insure the continued availability of the parking facility to the use it serves. E. OFF-SITE PARKING The permit issuing authority may allow off-site parking to account for up to 50% of the required parking for any
single use if sufficient operational specificity and rationale are provided during the permit review including some of
the following: 1. Private shuttle or transit or valet is available between the remote parking site and the use(s) it is intended to serve. 2. Private shuttle or transit service is provided for customers of the business, bringing them to and taking
them away from the site at their request or scheduled intervals. 3. Shared parking with another facility utilizing spaces not needed to meet the second facility’s requirements
under this Ordinance. 4. Leasing of off-site spaces not allocated to another use under this Ordinance. F. COMPACT PARKING SPACES In parking lots with more than twenty-five (25) parking spaces, compact car spaces may constitute up to twenty-five (25) percent of the total number of spaces provided. Compact spaces shall be clearly and permanently designated on the site plan and in parking areas.

6.16 RECREATION SITES A. PURPOSE AND INTENT It is the intent of this section to protect and promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by requiring the dedication of a portion of land for the purpose of providing recreation space and/or equipment in accord with the Town of Wallace Parks and Recreation Master Plan. B. APPLICABILITY Every development proposal containing 5 or more residential units, whether attached or detached, shall include dedication of a portion of the land for public recreation to serve the leisure needs of the residents of the development. If a development is proposed in a location recommended for recreation improvements in the adopted Parks and Recreation Master Plan or adopted small area plan, the development plan shall indicate the extent to which the proposal fulfills the intent of the adopted plan. C. CALCULATION OF REQUIRED AREA The applicant shall provide land for recreation, provide improvements for recreation, provide fees in lieu of land and improvements, or provide a combination of the above according to the following: 1. At least one thirty fifth (1/35) of an acre (.029 acres) shall be dedicated for each dwelling unit shown in the plan, or 2. Detached dwelling units shall be assigned 12 recreation points per dwelling. Points for each attached dwelling
unit based on the number of bedrooms per units shown in the plan shall be required for recreational
improvements according to Table 6.16.1, RECREATION POINTS AND ATTACHED DWELLING UNITS; or 3. Fees in lieu of dedication of recreational area and improvements may be paid according to Section 6.16(I),
PAYMENTS IN LIEU OF DEDICATION, for each dwelling unit shown in the subdivision plan; or 4. A combination of the three above methods may be used to satisfy the recreational dedication requirements, provided, however, that the final approval of the applicant’s plan shall at all times remain with the permit issuing authority. In the computation of recreational requirements: four hundred (420) points shall be deemed to equal one (1) acre;
and, when calculating a combination of the above, the recreational space cannot be utilized more than once (for example, a swimming pool which equals 356 points cannot use its 768 square feet of land in the acreage calculation). In all cases, the Parks and Recreation Board shall review and make recommendations to the Planning
Board and Town Council on the applicant’s proposed provision or dedication of recreational space; and, the Town Council shall make the final decision. Table 6.16.1: RECREATION POINTS AND ATTACHED DWELLING UNITS
Dwelling Units Minimum Points Required
One bedroom unit 6.0
Two bedroom unit 9.5
Three or more bedrooms 12

E. CHARACTERISTICS OF REQUIRED AREA 1. SITE SUITABILITY FOR ACTIVE RECREATION AREAS (a) Land provided or dedicated for active recreational purposes shall be of a character, slope and location suitable for use as play areas, tennis courts, multipurpose courts, picnic areas, ball fields and other similar recreation uses. (b) Active recreation areas shall be located on land that is relatively flat (0 to 7 1/2% slopes), free of wet lands and/or flood plains, free of easements for public utility transmission lines, and otherwise capable of accommodating active recreation uses. 2. SITE SUITABILITY FOR PASSIVE RECREATION AREAS Land provided or dedicated for passive recreation and open space purposes shall be of a character, slope and location suitable for use for walking, jogging, reading and similar quiet activities, and the preservation of
natural features and cultural resources such as steep slopes, rock outcrops, native plant life and wildlife cover, nature woodlands and water resources. 3. LOCATION Land dedicated for recreation purposes shall be located so as to serve the needs of the immediate residents of
the subdivision. Recreation areas shall be centrally located so as to provide relatively easy accessibility to all residents of the subdivision; provided, however, recreation areas may be approved in other locations where land more suited for recreation purposes due to shape, level slopes and/ or dry soil conditions is present. 4. UNITY Land dedicated for recreation purposes shall be a single lot except where it is determined that two (2) or more lots are suited to the needs of a particular subdivision. The Planning Board may recommend, and the Town Council may require, the dedication of a path connecting two or more recreation areas, in addition to the land required in Section 6.16(C), CALCULATION OF REQUIRED AREA.
F. SITE IMPROVEMENTS Private recreation facilities either required or provided at the option of the applicant, shall meet the standards for site improvements contained herein. When choosing improvements for a recreational area, the anticipated characteristics and needs of the residents/businesses shall be considered in conjunction with the size of the development, any physical constraints posed by the site, and the availability of other improvements within the same general area as the subdivision. As an example, the existence of a multi-purpose court in an adjacent, existing
subdivision and the availability of the facility for use by residents of the proposed subdivision may indicate to the applicant that another facility, such as a tennis court, would be more appropriate. Recreation facilities which are suitable for various age groups include, but are not limited to those shown on the following pages. Trash receptacles
shall be provided for all recreational areas regardless of the number and type of other improvements located thereon. In addition to land provided or dedicated for active recreation purposes, sufficient area shall be provided to meet off-street parking requirements for the proposed improvements as shown in Table 6.14.1, MINIMUM NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES REQUIRED. G. POINTS SYSTEM Active recreation areas shall be easily visible from and have direct access to public street(s) and shall be designated as such on preliminary and final plats. Active recreation areas and facilities shall be provided to such extent that the sum total of recreation points
assigned to each recreational area and facility (under subsection b) equals or exceeds the number of recreation points required in that development in accordance with the remaining provisions of this section.

For purposes of this subsection, a recreation point is a unit of measurement that allows various types of recreational
areas and facilities to be compared to one another. The principal criterion upon which recreation points are assigned to various facilities is the cost associated with the development of such facilities. The following table establishes the recreation points assignable to the facilities listed. Points for facilities not included on the table below shall be determined by the permit issuing authority. Table 6.16.2: RECREATION POINTS
Facility Points Per SF Typical Points Typical Square Ft

Volleyball Court .014 25 1800
The minimum total recreation points required of any attached dwelling development shall equal the sum of the number of recreation points assigned to each dwelling unit. Play equipment suitable for children under twelve shall
comprise at least five (5) percent of the total points required. Active recreational facilities and areas should be located throughout the development so that they can be reached safely and easily by their anticipated users. Such facilities and areas must be on land that is suitable for the use intended, have a minimum of twelve hundred (1200)
square feet per area, and be sufficiently buffered to minimize the impacts on adjacent residences. H. METHOD OF PROVISION OR DEDICATION Land dedicated for public recreation area shall be designated on both the preliminary and final plat(s) of the development and must be dedicated to an appropriate unit of local government. Determination of the appropriate unit of local government shall be made by the Town Council, upon recommendation from the Parks and Recreation Board and the Planning Board. Acceptance of the dedication may be one in trust if deemed appropriate by the Town Council. Land provided for private recreation purposes must be conveyed to a property owners’ association subject to covenants and easements to be approved by the Planning Board and Town Council and which provide for the continued maintenance and control of the recreation area in a manner which assures its continuing use for its
intended purpose. The formal declaration of covenants and restrictions shall be recorded in the Register of Deeds
Office. I. PAYMENTS IN LIEU OF DEDICATION Any applicant required to dedicate or provide recreation area pursuant to this Ordinance may, with the approval of
the Town Council, make a payment in lieu of dedication or make a combination of land dedication and payment.
Before approving a payment in lieu of dedication, the Town Council shall find that no recreation sites have been designated on the Master Parks and Recreation Plan for the property in question.
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 6: Development Standards
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 6-35
The amount of a payment in lieu of dedication shall equal the number of acres required to be dedicated multiplied by the fair market value of the land to be dedicated. Fair market value shall be determined by dividing the tax
appraisal of the property at last re-evaluation by the current year assessment ratio. Upon approval by the Town Council, payment in lieu of dedication shall be made at the time of final plat approval or within one year of approval of the construction drawings, whichever occurs first. All monies received by the Town of
Wallace pursuant to this section shall be used only for the acquisition and/or development within the same park
district as shown in the Master Parks and Recreation Plan of land for a public park facility . The Town Council has the authority to sell land dedicated pursuant to these provisions, provided that the proceeds of any such sale shall be used solely for the acquisition and/or development of other recreation or park sites within the same park district. Developments within the extraterritorial jurisdiction and those with less than twenty (20) dwellings will be encouraged to pursue payment in lieu of dedication if they wish provide public ownership of any required recreational facilities due to the town’s inability to maintain facilities outside the city limits or in small installations. 6.17 SCREENING A. PURPOSE AND INTENT It is the general intent of this section to provide for screening of utilities and mechanical units that may have adverse impacts on residential and pedestrian areas. Non-residential developments require service areas to accommodate utilities, waste handling, air handling, and supplementary power. This section of the Ordinance provides guidance on reducing any adverse impacts while still maintaining convenience and walkability. Buffers
between different zoning districts are addressed in Section 6.5, BUFFERS.
B. APPLICABILITY Where non-residential development is adjacent to residentially zoned or used property or adjacent to areas that encourage pedestrian activity or access, the applicant shall address the potential adverse impacts of service areas to the residential and pedestrian uses. The permit issuing authority shall consider the potential impacts including, but not limited to, the following on adjacent residents and pedestrian areas: 1. Dumpsters and recycling collection areas 2. Air handling equipment 3. Supplementary power 4. Electric Utilities and Transformers 5. Phone, Cable and other utility services 6. Hot boxes & sprinkler connections
7. Grease traps 8. Service courts 9. Lighting
10. Satellite Dishes/ Solar Panels C. REQUIREMENTS The screening requirement will be based on the type of impact to be mitigated. 1. NOISE Solid waste areas, air handling equipment, supplementary power, parking and service courts can have noise impacts at the time of use or the sound generated by the machinery itself. Applicants shall provide noise level
documentation for equipment located adjacent to the residential or pedestrian use. The permit issuing
authority may require any one, or a combination of fencing, distance, and baffling as needed to minimize noise generated by such facilities. Areas that are serviced between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. shall be located at least 50 feet from a structure in residential use.

Unified Development Ordinance
Page 6-36
2. VISUAL (a) Solid waste areas, utility meters, hot boxes and sprinkler connections, and service courts shall be screened from residences, pedestrian areas, and adjacent streets through landscaping, fences, walls,
or grade changes of sufficient height to mitigate the visual impact of the utility being screened when viewed from the adjacent parcel, pedestrian area or street. (b) Solid waste areas shall be screened by a fence or wall tall enough to screen the solid waste from view.
The solid waste storage area shall be enclosed and secured by a gate. (c) Air handling units, condensers, satellite dishes and other equipment that is placed on the roof shall be screened from view by building elements in order to shield from sight at grade as well as from nearby
public rights-of-way 3. LIGHT Parking areas, service courts, delivery areas or others that include overhead and security lighting shall satisfy
the lighting of this Ordinance. Further, local streets and residential properties shall be protected from headlight trespass through the installation of sufficiently tall landscaping or screening. 6.18 SIDEWALKS AND WALKWAYS A. PURPOSE AND INTENT It is the general intent of this section to provide for public health, safety, and welfare by promoting connectivity and multi-modal travel methods to improve quality of life and air quality by requiring the installation of sidewalks and walkways. B. APPLICABILITY This section describes the types of new development required to construct public sidewalks or walkways as a component of their development. For this section the term “new development” applies to a Special Use Permit, or a Master Plan including subdivisions of land, and site plans for any parcel one (1) acre or greater, or the construction of a new principle structure on a parcel, or significant renovation of an existing structure or vehicle accommodation areas that disturbs 50% or more of the parcel area. C. GENERAL PROVISIONS 1. DEVELOPMENT SITES If a parcel fronts on a street segment designated as a high priority or Duplin County priority sidewalk segment in the sidewalk recommendation map of the Community Connectivity Plan, any new development on that parcel shall construct a public sidewalk along the designated frontage. The permit issuing authority may modify
this requirement upon presentation by the applicant for development approval of competent evidence demonstrating that strict compliance with this standard is not economically feasible or reasonably practicable due to topography, stream buffer requirements, or other similar reasons. The permit issuing authority may, as a
condition of any waiver or modification of this sidewalk requirement require a partial payment equal to no more than the cost of the sidewalk segment for which the waiver or modification are granted. All payments
received shall be deposited into the Town’s sidewalk construction capital fund.
If a parcel fronts a street segment designated as a low priority sidewalk segment in the sidewalk
recommendation map of the Community Connectivity Plan, any new development on that parcel shall either (1)
construct the sidewalk along the designated frontage or (2) at the applicant’s option, make a payment to the Town in lieu of constructing a sidewalk, or (3) a combination of (1) and (2). The permit issuing authority shall
establish the amount of the payment, which shall not exceed the estimated cost of the construction of the sidewalk or section thereof. All payments received shall be deposited into the Town’s sidewalk construction capital fund.

2. NEW PUBLIC STREETS (a) Sidewalks will be provided along both sides of all proposed and existing public streets within development. (b) Sidewalks will be provided along any existing public road directly accessed by the proposed development as follows: i. The sidewalk will extend the length of the property adjacent to the roadway on the same side as the proposed development. ii. The developer will provide any necessary additional right-of-way needed for the sidewalk to either the Town or NCDOT, as appropriate. 3. DESIGN REQUIREMENTS (a) Sidewalks built adjacent to an NCDOT road facility shall be built to meet NCDOT sidewalk standards. (b) Sidewalks shall be at least five (5) feet wide and constructed of concrete at least five (5) inches thick, or such other material as may be approved by the permit issuing authority. (c) Sidewalks shall connect via a direct link to the primary building entry. (d) For non-residential lots with existing sidewalks or for sidewalks constructed as part of a new development, shade trees shall be located in the parcel front yard so as to shade the walkway without damaging it. The shade trees shall be installed 10’ behind the sidewalk and be spaced no greater than 40’ on center. This requirement shall not be applied to non-residential buildings built within 10’ of the ROW or with a front courtyard or other side features that provide similar shading. (e) For non-residential buildings built within 10’ of the right-of-way shade trees shall be installed between the curb and sidewalk in accordance with town planting and right-of-way standards. (f) Sidewalks and walkways shall be constructed to meet ADA requirements (g) When a retaining wall of 30 inches or more in height or a steep grade exceeding a 1:1 ratio is located within five feet of a sidewalk or other constructed system designed and placed as to direct public pedestrian traffic, a barrier shall be constructed and maintained between the sidewalk and the grade change. (h) When the horizontal slope of a sidewalk exceeds the minimum grade allowed by ADA, it shall be treated as a ramp with railing requirements. D. MAINTENANCE All sidewalks shall be adequately maintained and kept in a safe and neat manner.

6.19 SIGNAGE A. INTENT It is the general intent of this section to help protect and preserve the historic and aesthetic character of Wallace while balancing with those interests the need of businesses, government and the traveling public to safely and accurately identify and read information on permitted signs. Toward that end, the Town adopts these regulations
regarding the number, area, location and other characteristics of signs. B. SIGNS SUBJECT TO CONTROL All signs visible from vehicular rights-of-way, both new and existing, shall be erected, maintained, and operated in accordance with this Ordinance and other relevant controls unless specifically exempted. The definition of “sign”
also includes those messages inside a building specifically oriented to persons outside the building. The provisions of
this section do not apply to window displays of merchandise but do apply to signs mounted in windows. C. ZONING COMPLIANCE PERMIT REQUIRED Before any sign shall be erected, replaced, converted, changed, structurally altered, or otherwise modified, a Zoning
Compliance Permit must be obtained except those specifically exempted from such a requirement.
In the case of a multi-tenant development, the Zoning Compliance Permit shall be issued in the name of the owner of the multi-tenant development or his agent rather than in the name of any individual tenant thereof, and it shall
be the sole responsibility of such owner or agent to allocate among the tenants the permissible maximum sign surface area established by this Ordinance. Upon application by the owner of a multi-tenant development, the Planning Director may issue a master sign permit that allocates permissible maximum sign surface area among the various buildings, businesses or tenancies in the development according to a formula established and furnished by the owner, and thereafter sign permits shall be issued to individual tenants only in accordance with the allocation formula on record with the Planning Director. No sign permit shall be issued for any sign which conflicts with the allocation formula on record, and no new freestanding sign may be erected except in accordance with the then existing sign regulations established by this Ordinance, and with the allocation formula on record.

N. COMPUTATION OF SIGN AREA
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 6: Development Standards
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 6-48
For the purpose of determining the number of signs permitted, a sign shall be considered to be a single display
device containing elements organized, related, and composed to form a unit. Without limiting the generality of the above, a multi-sided sign shall be regarded as one sign. 1. The surface area of a sign shall be computed by including the entire area within a single, continuous, rectilinear perimeter of not more than eight (8) straight lines, or a circle or an ellipse, enclosing the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework or bracing that is clearly incidental to the display itself. 2. If the sign consists of more than one (1) section or module, all of the area, including that between sections or modules, shall be included in the computation of the sign area. 3. Freestanding signs are typically two-sided therefore the surface area shall be computed by calculating each of
the two sides independently to determine the maximum square footage allowed. 4. Generally, parcels and businesses are permitted to have both freestanding and wall mounted signs to the extent to which signs can be erected and maintained to be in full compliance with this ordinance. The area of
these signs is calculated independently. O. PERMANENT SIGNS NOT SUBJECT TO PERMIT REQUIREMENTS The following permanent signs are allowed and are not subject to the permit requirements of this Ordinance, but are subject to all other applicable provisions of this Ordinance, including Historic District requirements for Certificates of Appropriateness as described in Section 3.11, CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS of this Ordinance when located in the Historic District. 1. Non-illuminated signs not exceeding two (2) per lot and six (6) square feet each in area, bearing only property
identification numbers and names, post office box numbers, and names of occupants of the premises. 2. Signs two (2) square feet in area posted on private property relating to private parking, warning the public against trespass or danger from animals. 3. Flags or insignia of any governmental or non-profit organization when not displayed in connection with commercial activity or promotion. One (1) flag (each) of the United States and of the State of North Carolina no larger than 100 square feet may be displayed in connection with a commercial activity without being subject to the permit requirements of this section. 4. Legal notices, identification and informational signs installed by governmental agencies authorized by the Town of Wallace. 5. Local traffic directional signs erected in the travel right of way by or on behalf of a governmental entity
provided such signs are consistent with the Manual of Uniform Transportation Control Devices or Town’s
official wayfinding plan. 6. Memorial signs or tablets, and names and construction dates of buildings when cut into any masonry surface or when placed as a cast iron (or similar) plaque affixed to the building structure. 7. Signs not exceeding four (4) square feet and bearing no advertising matter directing and guiding traffic on multi-family or non-residential property. 8. In addition to the signs allowed in Section 6.19(L), TRACT IDENTIFICATION SIGNS, above, the owner, property
manager, home owners association or residents association of a residential or multi-family development may install a community event bulletin board at each entrance to the development. A community event bulletin board shall not be located in the public right of way, nor shall it be located in such a way as to interfere with

Unified Development Ordinance
Page 6-49
lines of sight for vehicular traffic on, entering or exiting the public right of way. Each sign shall meet the following criteria: one unlighted, single-sided sign per entrance, 3’ X 4’ maximum dimensions, and 6’ maximum
installation height. The sign face (i.e., the single side of the sign on which information may be posted) shall be oriented toward traffic exiting the development, so that the sign face is not visible from the public right of way outside the subdivision or multi-family development it serves. Postings on the bulletin board shall be maintained in a neat and orderly condition and monitored by the home owner’s association or property
manager. P. TEMPORARY SIGNS NOT SUBJECT TO PERMIT REQUIREMENTS No temporary sign may be affixed, attached, or painted upon any utility pole, or upon any tree, rock, or other natural object. All temporary signs referring to commercial operations must include the name of the business entity

W. NONCONFORMING SIGNS 1. Nonconforming signs, because of their location, design, height and other features, detract from the quality of
life and sense of place Wallace seeks to achieve and maintain. Therefore, it is the intent of this Ordinance that all nonconforming signs will eventually be brought into conformity with its provisions, and that nonconforming
signs will ultimately be phased out of existence. 2. No person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a
nonconforming sign. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no nonconforming sign may be enlarged or altered, nor may any illumination be added to any nonconforming sign. 3. A nonconforming sign structure may not be moved, replaced, or otherwise changed except to bring the sign into complete conformity with this Ordinance. The message contained on the sign may be changed provided that no change is made to the sign structure, and the sign area and dimensions are not changed. 4. If a nonconforming sign is damaged to an extent equal to or greater than 50% of the sign replacement cost (new) or destroyed, it may not thereafter be repaired, reconstructed, or replaced except in conformity with all the provisions of this Ordinance, and the remnants of the former sign structure shall be cleared from the land. 5.

SIGNAGE FOR MULTI-TENANT DEVELOPMENTS 1. Upon application for a multi-tenant development, the owner shall submit a sign allocation plan that indicates
how square footage will be shared among tenants. Different tenants may be advertised on a single sign attached to the same main sign structure. No tenant listing can be in print smaller than 6 inches tall. The total
allocation of sign area shall be divided (but not necessarily equally) between tenants and shall not exceed 150
square feet of total sign area and shall not exceed a height of thirty (30) feet. All other regulations for a high profile sign (Section 6.19(K): HIGH PROFILE SIGNS) are to be followed. 2.

Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 6: Development Standards
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 6-54
driveway access. For the purposes of determining sign specifications, a private access drive shall be treated as a
public road for determining setback, height, and size of sign. A freestanding sign may only be installed oriented toward a street or access drive that the outparcel has driveway access to. Z. INTERNAL WAYFINDING Multi-tenant developments with 2 or more access points or 3 or more buildings shall develop and install an internal
wayfinding sign program with components for both drivers and pedestrians.

Individual wayfinding signs do not count toward development or tenant signage and will be permitted on a single Zoning Compliance Permit. Internal wayfinding
signage must be at least 50 feet from the right of way of the street providing site access and must be oriented toward on-site traffic flow. AA. INSTITUTIONAL SIGNS Signs erected by schools, churches, hospitals, governmental buildings, and other institutions are permitted in all districts, but the size, type and other regulations are limited according to Table 6.19.1, SIGNS ALLOWED BY DISTRICT above. A sign permit is required for all types of intuitional signs. 6.20 STORMWATER ORDINANCE A. GENERAL POLICY: It shall be the policy of the Town of Wallace to require that all new developed land, which results in greater than 30
percent impervious area or greater than 15,000 square feet of impervious area, and redeveloped land which results
in additional impervious area resulting in greater than 30 percent within its jurisdiction have sufficient stormwater management controls in place so as to ensure the adequate protection of life and property. To this end, as a
minimum, new developed land, with greater than 30 percent or 15,000 square feet of impervious area and redeveloped land which results in additional impervious area resulting in greater than 30 percent within the jurisdiction of the Town shall provide stormwater controls capable of managing after-development runoff from a
ten-year storm, so that the on-site effects of development are the same or better than the predevelopment state.
The requirements of this ordinance shall be construed consistently with the requirements of the State of North Carolina for controlling stormwater quantity and quality. Where the requirements of this chapter are in conflict with the rules and regulations of the State of North Carolina, the more stringent or higher requirements shall govern. B. PURPOSE: The purpose of this section is to protect and promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to safeguard the natural and manmade resources of the town by regulating stormwater runoff. This purpose is
accomplished by imposing conditions and requirements upon existing and proposed development activities, and by
establishing procedures by which these requirements and conditions are to be administered and enforced. C. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this article are to: 1. Establish the town’s stormwater management program;
2. Identify areas prone to flooding; 3. Prevent the creation of new flood prone areas; 4. Reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extend practicable by controlling stormwater discharge rates and encouraging the use of best management practices, structural and/or nonstructural
stormwater quantity and quality control measures and other provisions; 5. Reduce erosion associated with stormwater runoff; 6. Provide the inspection and proper maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater facilities; 7. Prohibit non-stormwater discharges and require the removal of illicit discharges;
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 6: Development Standards
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 6-55
8. Prevent improper disposal of materials that degrade water quality; 9. Permit sampling and monitoring for pollutants such as those associated with illicit discharges, improper disposal, industrial and construction activities, and the application of pesticides and fertilizers. 10. Provide for the enforcement of the town’s stormwater management program. D. POLICIES 1. TOWN’S ROLE
The town has a role in the management of stormwater through authorization, planning, construction, operation and maintenance of facilities to reduce the adverse effects of stormwater runoff and to satisfy state and federal
statutes and regulations. 2. PROPERTY OWNER RESPONSIBILITY (a) It shall be the responsibility of individual property owners of developed or undeveloped land within the town jurisdictional limits, to maintain stormwater conveyance facilities, such as waterways, streams, creeks, ditches, swales, channels, canals, conduits and culverts, and stormwater control
facilities, such as ponds and lakes within their property. Where conditions of existing stormwater facilities are determined to be deficient, either intentional or due to a natural occurrence, and creates
a public nuisance, and the property owner fails to correct the deficiencies after being notified by the town, the town may arrange for the deficiencies to be corrected and recover all costs thereto from
the property owner. However, the recovery of costs from property owners is subject to appeal as
described in Section 3.10, APPEAL.
(b) In the event a property owner wishes to install pipe in an open ditch or drainage swale it is the responsibility of the property owner to obtain written approval from the town. The property owner shall provide a sketch or drawing showing the location, length, and size of the proposed pipe installation. The minimum pipe size shall be fifteen (15) inches unless approved by town. The town reserves the right to require the property owner to obtain a professional engineer to properly size the proposed pipe. (c) The property owner shall record, with the Duplin County Register of Deeds, an easement over all storm water transportation and retention/detention facilities, sufficient to provide maintenance of
the facilities. A copy of the recorded easement shall be provided to the town. 3. NEW DEVELOPMENT It is the policy of the town that all developable land within the town jurisdictional limits, to be developed, which results in more than 30 percent or greater than 15,000 square feet of impervious area shall have sufficient stormwater management controls to provide adequate protection of life, property and natural resources. To this end, as a minimum, all land disturbing activity subject to this article, shall provide sufficient management of
post-development runoff from the ten-year (10) frequency storm such that the discharge rates of post-
development stormwater runoff do not exceed the pre-development rates from the ten-year(10) frequency
storm. Residential lots of record as of the effective date of this ordinance are exempt from the requirements of
this ordinance. 4. REDEVELOPMENT It is the policy of the town that all nonresidential lots of record, as of the effective date of this ordinance, within the town jurisdictional limits to be redeveloped are not required to provide stormwater management controls
for the site, if the impervious area is not increased. If the impervious area is increased and results in greater than 30 percent impervious area, stormwater management controls shall be provided in order to better provide protection of life, property and natural resources. To this end, as a minimum any redevelopment activity which requires stormwater management controls, subject to this article, shall provide sufficient management of post-redevelopment runoff from the ten-year (10) frequency storm such that the discharge rate of post-redevelopment stormwater runoff does not exceed the predevelopment rates from the ten-year (10) frequency storm. Redevelopment of residential lots of record, as of the effective date of this ordinance, are exempt from the requirements of this ordinance.

J. INDUSTRIAL AND RELATED ACTIVITIES 1. REVIEW OF STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLANS. The town may review the stormwater pollution prevention plans required under a facility’s NPDES stormwater, discharge permit when outfall monitoring or the illicit discharge/improper disposal program locates a suspected violator. 6.21 STREETS A. PURPOSE AND INTENT It is the intent of this section to protect and promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by requiring the uniform construction of streets. Street rights-of-way are designed and developed to serve several functions: (i) to carry motor vehicle traffic, and in some cases, allow on-street parking; (ii) to provide a safe and convenient passageway for pedestrian traffic; and (iii) to serve as an important link in the town’s drainage system.
B. APPLICABILITY New streets will generally be dedicated to the town or NC Department of Transportation. Private streets are generally only permitted in minor subdivisions or within attached dwelling developments and are also regulated by
this section. C. DESIGN STANDARDS – PUBLIC STREETS 1. New public streets in the city limits must meet the Town of Wallace's Standard Specifications for Street Construction and Acceptance Procedures in the Checklist and Approval Requirements for Utility Projects. 2. Public streets in developments in the Town’s extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction must be approved and accepted by the NC Department of Transportation. 3. Minimum right of way widths by public street type: (a) Arterial Streets shall provide 100 feet of public right of way (b) Collector Streets shall provide 70 feet of public right of way (c) Local Streets shall provide 60 feet of public right of way (d) Cul de sacs shall provide 50 feet of public right of way 4. Additional street right-of-way may be required in cases where underground public utilities, sidewalks, and drainage facilities cannot all be located within the minimum stated above. 5. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles and no street shall intersect any
other street at an angle less than sixty (60) degrees. 6. The proposed street layout shall be coordinated with the existing street system of the surrounding area. Where possible, proposed streets shall be the extension of existing streets. Modification of the existing grid pattern may be allowed to accommodate site topography. 7. To maximize connectivity for public safety and avoid the requirement for additional right of way width improvement and dedication, block lengths will generally not exceed 400 feet and there will be two points of
access for any street containing 30 or more dwellings not equipped with individual sprinkler systems. 8. All permanent dead-end streets (as opposed to temporary dead-end streets or stubouts) shall be developed as
cul-de-sacs in accordance with the standards set forth in the Fire Code. To avoid the requirement of additional
right of way width improvement and dedication, dead-end streets may not exceed 400 feet in length.
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 6: Development Standards
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 6-66
9. Cul-de-sacs shall not be used to avoid connection with an existing street or to avoid the extension of an important street. 10. Whenever possible, proposed intersections along one side of a street shall coincide with existing or proposed intersection on the opposite side of such street. In any event, where a centerline offset (jog) occurs at an intersection, the distance between centerlines of the intersecting streets shall be not less than 150 feet. 11. Except when no other alternative is practicable or legally possible, no two streets may intersect with any other street on the same side at a distance of less than 400 feet measured from centerline to centerline of the intersecting street. When the intersected street is an arterial, the distance between intersecting streets shall be at least 1000 feet. 12. The permit issuing authority may require the applicant to extend a right of way, build the street, and/or provide a temporary cul-de-sac in order to stub out streets that should be connected to existing or proposed streets
outside the subdivision. D. DESIGN STANDARDS - PRIVATE ROADS 1. Any private road within an attached dwelling or multi-family development must meet the design standards for town public streets. 2. Any private road within a minor residential subdivision must have a minimum right of way width of twenty feet which includes the travel way and associated drainage facilities. Any underground utilities may be located within the road right of way or a separate utility right of way. 3. A private road within a minor residential subdivision may be required to provide a right of way of fifty (50) feet if the land and lots are arranged to allow the potential conversion of the road to a public road. If the lot arrangement, surrounding development pattern, zoning, and existing town plans indicate conversion is unlikely, the permit issuing authority may allow a private road to reduce the right of way width to no less than 18 feet. 4. Lots for single family detached dwellings may be created with access to a private road provided that: (a) No more than four (4) lots may have their sole access to the private road; (b) A new private road shall not be an extension of any existing public or private road; and (c) A new private road shall not be aligned with an existing public road in such a way as may interfere with any planned extension of the public road. 5. The intent of this subsection is primarily to allow the creation of not more than four (4) lots with frontage on a private road for single-family development. Therefore, the Town may not approve any project served by a
private road authorized by this subsection in which one (1) or more of the lots thereby created is intended for: (a) Two-family or multi-family residential use, or
(b) Any other residential use or nonresidential use that would tend to generate more traffic than that customarily generated by four (4) single-family residences. 6. To ensure that the intent of this subsection is not subverted, the Town may, among other possible options, require that the approved plans show the types and locations of buildings on each lot or that the lots in a residential development served by a private road be smaller than the permissible size of lots on which two-
family or multifamily developments could be located, or that restrictive covenants limiting the use of the subdivided property in accordance with this section be recorded before final plat approval. 7. No final plat that shows lots served by private roads may be recorded unless the final plat contains the following notation: “Further subdivision of any lot shown on this plat as served by a private road may be prohibited by the Town of Wallace Unified Development Ordinance.”
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 6: Development Standards
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 6-67
8. The recorded plat of any development that includes a private road shall clearly state that such road is a private road and must be accompanied by a private road maintenance agreement that is also recorded. E. STREET NAMES AND SIGNS – PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STREETS 1. Names of streets which duplicate or can be confused with the names of existing streets within Duplin County, shall not be approved. New street names shall be reviewed and approved by Duplin County E-911 Addressing
so as to avoid duplication and/or unnecessary confusion caused by similar street names. 2. Extensions of existing and named streets shall bear the name of such existing streets. 3. House numbering will be assigned by the Duplin County E-911 Addressing department in accordance with its
policies. All structures must display current and correct 911-address as per Section 6.15. 4. Approved street name signs shall be erected by the applicant at the intersection of streets as specified in the Manual of Uniform Traffic Devices. 6.22 TREE PROTECTION STANDARDS A. PURPOSE AND INTENT It is the intent of this section to protect and promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by requiring the preservation, maintenance, and protection of the tree coverage area. Preservation of the tree coverage area helps
to reduce carbon emissions and decrease the urban “heat-island” effect.
B. APPLICABILITY Every application for a Master Plan, site plan, grading plan, or Special Use Permit or any modification to any of the listed permit types shall provide a tree inventory and protection plan. This plan shall also be included in the grading
plan of the construction drawings for any of the review types listed. Applicants submitting a grading plan as part of a
Zoning Compliance Permit application where no building or structure is proposed shall also submit provide a tree inventory and protection plan. C. REQUIREMENTS

6. For each 24” or greater tree proposed for removal, the applicant shall indicate all design alternatives
considered to allow the retention of the tree. 7. A tree protection plan will show the tree coverage area before development and shall indicate which method was used to calculate the tree coverage area. D. STANDARDS 1. Applications shall clearly state the number of canopy trees to be removed, along with an estimate of the number being retained on site. 2. Applications shall also include a calculation of percentage of the site covered by tree coverage area before and after development. (a) For sites with existing, pre-development tree coverage area that covers 25% or less of the site, it is
expected that the developed condition of the site shall not reduce this percentage. (b) For sites with existing, pre-development tree coverage area that covers more than 25% but less than 50% of the site, maintenance of the tree coverage area is required. (c) For sites with existing pre-development tree coverage area that covers more than 50% of the site, some reduction of that percentage may be approved by the permit issuing authority. E. PRIORITY TREE RETENTION AREAS Priority areas for retention of existing tress and vegetation shall include the following (listed in priority order from
highest priority to lowest priority): (a) Areas containing canopy trees 24” dbh or greater and their critical root zones
(b) Areas containing groups or stands of mature trees that provide important design, buffering, forest preservation, or wildlife functions. (c) Riparian buffers, wetlands, or wetland protection areas (d) Areas with a natural grade of 15% or more (e) Areas needed for required landscaping
(f) Wildlife habitat or other sensitive natural areas. Figure 6-11: TREE PROTECTION ZONE

E. PRIORITY TREE RETENTION AREAS Priority areas for retention of existing tress and vegetation shall include the following (listed in priority order from
highest priority to lowest priority): (a) Areas containing canopy trees 24” dbh or greater and their critical root zones
(b) Areas containing groups or stands of mature trees that provide important design, buffering, forest preservation, or wildlife functions. (c) Riparian buffers, wetlands, or wetland protection areas (d) Areas with a natural grade of 15% or more (e) Areas needed for required landscaping (f) Wildlife habitat or other sensitive natural areas. F. REVEGETATION 1. If canopy trees are removed from an area not designated for removal on the approved grading plan, the applicant shall replant trees on an inch per inch basis based on caliper or trunk diameter the size of the removed canopy tree(s) elsewhere on the site, OR preserve an additional area on the site with comparable tree composition that is the same size as the area damaged. For example, if 6 canopy trees are improperly removed from a site, each with a 10” diameter truck, 60” of new trees must be planted on site OR 60” worth of new canopy trees must be preserved on site. 2. Planted trees will be of a similar species, if available, and shall be a minimum of 2” caliper at time of planting.
3. If a site does not contain sufficient space to create healthy habitat for the needed replanting, the applicant may make a payment to the Town (to be used for planting by the Tree Board) in an amount equal to the cost of
acquiring and planting the required trees OR may make the plantings elsewhere but within the development in which the site is located, if applicable. 6.23 WASTEWATER DISPOSAL Plans for a proposed public or community sewage system shall be approved by the Public Works Director, Health Department, or Director of the Division of Environmental Management, whichever is appropriate.

Chapter 7 – Nonconformities
7.1 GENERAL APPLICABILITY
A. NONCONFORMITIES GENERALLY
Uses of land which do not conform to the requirements of this Ordinance may not be enlarged, expanded, nor altered, except in conformance with this Ordinance.
Nonconformities shall not be used as grounds for adding other prohibited uses or structures, nor for the enlarging by means of extension or expansion, except as specifically provided by this Ordinance.
B. COMPLETION OF NONCONFORMING PROJECTS
1. For purposes of this section, a nonconforming project shall include any structure, development, or undertaking that is incomplete at the effective date of this Ordinance, or amendment thereto, and would be inconsistent with any regulation applicable to the district in which it is located if completed as proposed or planned.
2. A nonconforming project for which a completed application has been submitted to and accepted by the Planning Director prior to the effective date of this Ordinance shall be reviewed in accordance with the standards applicable on the date the complete application was accepted.
3. Any nonconforming project for which a permit was issued under the previous Zoning Ordinance may be completed in accordance with the terms of such permit, so long as it remains unexpired and unrevoked.
4. If a permit has been issued for a nonconforming project and such permit remains unexpired and unrevoked, an applicant may seek modification of such permit from the permit issuing authority that granted the original permit, and such permit issuing authority may approve the requested modification if it determines that the proposed changes will result in a project that is not more nonconforming in terms of the present Ordinance than the project approved under the previous Ordinance.
C. CLASSIFICATION OF NONCONFORMITIES
Nonconformities are classified as:
1. Uses of major structures and premises (Section 7.2),
2. Characteristics of uses (Section 7.3) which were lawful but would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted by the enactment of this Ordinance or a subsequent amendment thereto,
3. Structures (Section 7.4) and/or
4. Lots (Section 7.5).
7.2 NONCONFORMING USES
A. INTENT CONCERNING NONCONFORMING USES: SPECIFICALLY DECLARED TO BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH PERMITTED USES
It is the intent of this Ordinance that nonconforming uses of land shall be considered to be incompatible with the permitted uses within the district(s) in which they are located. Such nonconforming uses shall not be enlarged or extended in any respect.
Once a nonconforming use has ceased to operate or has been discontinued for a period of 120 consecutive days, it may not be resumed and shall only be replaced with a conforming use.
B. CHANGE OF USE
1. GENERAL
A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any other nonconforming use, except as provided in Section 7.2(B)(2), EXCEPTIONS.
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 7: Nonconformities
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 7-3
2. EXCEPTIONS
Nonconforming residential, office, or personal services uses within a industrial or commercial base zoning district may be continued or replaced by another nonconforming residential, office, or personal service use, upon the issuance of a Zoning Compliance Permit based on the standards in Section 7.2(B)(3).
Nonconforming non-residential uses within a residential zoning district may be replaced by another nonconforming non-residential use, upon the issuance of a Zoning Compliance Permit based on the standards in Section 7.2(B)(3).
3. The Planning Director may issue a Zoning Compliance Permit for a replacement use described in Section 7.2(B)(2), EXCEPTIONS, if the applicant substantiates that:
(a) The proposed use is a permitted use in some zoning district with either Zoning Compliance Permit or site plan approval;
(b) All the applicable requirements of this Ordinance must be met to the extent reasonably possible. Compliance with a requirement of this Ordinance is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation. Mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking or increased landscaping does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible. And in no case may an applicant be given permission pursuant to this subsection to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional nonconformities would thereby be created; and,
(c) The proposed replacement use will have the same or less adverse impact on those most affected by it than the existing or previous nonconforming use, and will be equal or more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the existing or previous nonconforming use applied for. The applicant shall provide the following information for both the existing and proposed use to demonstrate to the Planning Director the existence of an equal or less adverse impact on the surrounding areas:
i. Hours of operation;
ii. Traffic generation by vehicle type;
iii. Number of employees;
iv. External changes to structure;
v. Noxious exposure;
vi. Customer traffic, including time of day and number of trips; and
vii. Nature of use type.
(d) The cost of any reconstruction or renovation associated with the use change does not exceed one-third (1/3) of the existing structure’s replacement cost (new) prior to the reconstruction or renovation. In cases where the reconstruction or renovation cost exceeds one-third (1/3) of the structure’s replacement cost (new), then the use and structure must conform to the requirements of the district where located.
(e) In the case of a non-residential use in a residential zoning district, the structure is not reasonably suitable for a use allowed by right in the zoning district due to unique or unusual construction or characteristics.
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 7: Nonconformities
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 7-4
7.3 NONCONFORMING CHARACTERISTICS OF USE
A. Conforming uses with nonconforming characteristics may continue to operate but shall not be expanded, altered, changed, or relocated in such a manner as to increase the degree of nonconformity.
B. Nonconforming characteristics which can reasonably be corrected shall be addressed during the review of a new site plan or special use permit. For example, compliance may not be reasonably possible when compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot, moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation, or other significant site work. The permit-issuing authority may consider the cost of eliminating nonconforming characteristics in relation to the total project cost and the benefit to the community when determining what improvements are reasonable.
C. MULTIPLE DETACHED DWELLINGS ON A SINGLE PARCEL
The Town recognizes that some historic development patterns are inconsistent with modern requirements, and that some of the existing development patterns are part of the historic character of the Town. The Town finds that when such historic patterns persist into the present in a way that is consistent with the nearby surrounding development, it may advance the Town’s interest in preserving its historic character to allow the inconsistent pattern to remain, but to regulate the inconsistent land use in a manner as consistent with the modern requirements as possible to prevent unintended consequences.
Therefore, where two (2) or more detached single family residential structures exist on a single lot in the R-6, R-6MH, R-8, or R-10 District as of the original adoption date of this ordinance, the Planning Director may approve a plat to place each residential structure on an independent lot provided the plat shows:
1. That all lots have 30 feet of road frontage and access to a public road;
2. That all lots have no more than one single family residential structure on the lot;
3. That all lots provide for minimum side yard setbacks of at least 2 feet and a rear yard setback of at least 2 feet;
4. The plat shall evenly divide the space between the existing structures; and
5. No more than 10 lots may be created from a single parcel pursuant to this section.
7.4 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
A. NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE, OTHER THAN SIGNS
A structure (other than a sign) which is nonconforming, due to non-compliance with one or more requirements in Section 6.3, DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS, of this Ordinance and which is used for a use permitted in the district in which located, may remain, provided:
1. That any structural change to the structure shall not increase the degree of nonconformity. Structural changes which decrease or do not affect the degree of nonconformity shall be permitted.
2. That a nonconforming commercial or industrial structure or portion thereof which is damaged by causes other than the intentional or reckless acts of the property owner or authorized agent to such an extent that the cost to repair does not exceed fifty (50) percent of the structure’s taxable value, may be reconstructed. If such a structure is damaged by the intentional or reckless act of the property owner or authorized agent, or is otherwise damaged to such an extent that the cost to repair exceeds fifty (50%) percent of the structure’s current tax value, or is destroyed, then the structure may not be reconstructed except in accordance with all requirements established by this Ordinance for the zoning district in which it is situated.
3. That a nonconforming residential structure, or a portion thereof which is partially or totally destroyed, may be reconstructed or replaced. The total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use may not be increased, except that a larger, single-family residential structure may be constructed in place of a smaller
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 7: Nonconformities
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 7-5
one, a larger mobile home intended for residential use may replace a smaller one, and a mobile home may be replaced by a framed structure. The reconstructed residential structure may not be more nonconforming with respect to dimensional restrictions such as, yard requirements, height limitations, or density requirements, and such dimensional nonconformities must be eliminated if that can reasonably be accomplished without unduly burdening the reconstruction process or limiting the right to continue the nonconforming use of such structure. A building permit must be obtained within one (1) year from the time of damage or destruction.
4. Nonconforming provisions related to signs are provided in Section 6.19, SIGNAGE.
B. ADDITIONS TO NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
The Planning Director may issue a Zoning Compliance Permit to authorize an existing nonconforming structure to encroach upon a setback required in Section 6.3, DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS, provided:
1. The proposed encroachment results from an addition to or extension of an existing structure that already is nonconforming with respect to the requirements of Section 6.3, DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS; and
2. The proposed addition or extension will not encroach upon any required front, rear, or side yard to a greater extent than the existing structure on that lot.
C. NONCONFORMING USES OF MAJOR STRUCTURES AND PREMISES IN COMBINATION
Nonconforming use of structures may be continued provided:
1. Such uses may not be enlarged, extended, altered, or replaced, except for to change to a use permitted in the district in which located, except as provided in Section 7.4(C)(2) below.
2. A nonconforming use may be extended through portions of a building manifestly arranged or intended for such use, but not otherwise, and shall not extend to occupy land outside such building or any additional building not used for such nonconforming use at the time that nonconforming status was established.
3. If a nonconforming use ceases for more than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, subsequent use shall conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located.
D. NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES UNSAFE FOR REASONS OTHER THAN LACK OF MAINTENANCE
Nonconforming structures or portions thereof, which the Planning Director has declared unsafe, but not because of lack of maintenance, may be repaired and restored to the extent required to make them safe unless this would violate those provisions of Section 7.4(A), NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE OTHER THAN SIGNS.
7.5 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD
A. USE OF SINGLE NONCONFORMING LOTS FOR ONE-FAMILY DETACHED DWELLINGS
A one-family detached dwelling and customary accessory structure may be erected, occupied, and used on a single nonconforming lot of record, subject to Section 7.5(B), COMBINATION OF CONTIGUOUS NONCONFORMING LOTS IN SINGLE OWNERSHIP AND WITH CONTINUOUS FRONTAGE, EXCEPTION, and in accord with requirements applying in the district.
B. COMBINATION OF CONTIGUOUS NONCONFORMING LOTS IN SINGLE OWNERSHIP AND WITH CONTINUOUS FRONTAGE; EXCEPTION
It is the intent of this subsection to require undeveloped nonconforming lots (those having separate, individual deeds) held in single ownership to be combined with other nonconforming lots to create less nonconforming lots under the circumstances below, but not to require such combination when it would be out of character with the way the neighborhood has previously been developed.
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 7: Nonconformities
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 7-6
1. Where two (2) or more undeveloped nonconforming lots in single ownership adjoin and have continuous road frontage, such lots shall be combined to create less nonconforming lots with respect to minimum lot size, road frontage, and setback requirements.
2. Combination of nonconforming, continuous frontage lots in single ownership shall not be required when all of the following conditions exist:
(a) One (1) or more of the lots contains a principal structure built before the original adoption date of this ordinance,
(b) The existing structure does not cross the property line between two nonconforming lots,
(c) Any vacant lot(s) are not less than fifty (50) feet wide,
(d) The lots will be used for one family detached dwellings and customary accessory structures,
(e) A majority of the developed residential lots within five hundred feet (500) feet of such lots are also nonconforming with regard to minimum lot size or frontage, and
(f) Adequate water and sewer facilities exist or will be install to accommodate the small lot size.
3. Combination is also not required when the nonconforming lot was created by public taking action or as a result of a court order.
C. LOTS NOT MEETING MINIMUM LOT SIZE REQUIREMENTS
In any district in which single family dwellings are permitted, any lot of record existing at the time of the adoption of these regulations which has dimensions which are less than require by these regulations may be used as building site for a single family dwelling providing the lot area and width are not less than eighty (80) percent of the requirements in the district. If the lot is smaller or narrower, a variance may be requested from the Board of Adjustment.
D. YARD REQUIREMENTS MODIFIED
Lots created prior to the adoption of this ordinance, where a lot width or depth is less than that required in the zoning district to which it is located, a structure will be allowed to be built or placed upon the lot as long as it can meet the current required setbacks. Otherwise, a yard modification may be permitted with a variance granted by the Board of Adjustment.

L. POWERS AND DUTIES OF PLANNING DIRECTOR
The Planning Director is hereby designated as the officer to enforce the provisions of this ordinance and to exercise the duties and powers herein prescribed. The Planning Director is authorized to exercise such powers as may be necessary or convenient to carry out and effectuate the purpose and provisions of this Ordinance. The Planning Director shall have the following powers and duties:
1. To investigate the dwelling conditions and to inspect dwellings and dwelling units located in the planning jurisdiction of the Town of Wallace, in order to determine which dwellings and dwelling units are unfit for human habitation, and for the purpose of carrying out the objectives of this Ordinance with respect to repair, closing, or demolition of such dwellings and dwelling units;
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 8: Maintenance Standards
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 8-9
2. To take such action, together with other appropriate departments and agencies, public and private, as may be necessary to effect rehabilitation of housing which is deteriorated;
3. To keep a record of the results of inspections made under this Ordinance and an inventory if those dwellings that do not meet the minimum standards of fitness herein prescribed;
4. To administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence;
5. To enter upon premises for the purpose of making examinations and inspections; provided, such entries shall be made in accordance with Section 8.2(M) INSPECTIONS, DUTY OF OWNERS AND OCCUPANTS of this Ordinance and State law, and shall be made in such manner as to cause the least possible inconvenience to the persons in possession;
6. To appoint and fix the duties of such officers, agents, and employees as he deems necessary to assist in carrying out the purposes of this Ordinance, and to delegate any of his functions and powers to such officers, agents, and employees; and
7. To perform such other duties as may be prescribed herein or by the Town Council.
M. INSPECTIONS, DUTY OF OWNERS AND OCCUPANTS
1. For the purpose of making inspections, the Planning Director is hereby authorized to enter examine, and survey at all reasonable times all dwellings, dwelling units, rooming houses, rooming units, and the premises associated therewith. The owner or occupant of every dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming house, or rooming unit, or the person in charge thereof, shall give the official free access to such dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming house, or rooming unit as it premises at all reasonable times for the purposes of such inspection, examination, and survey.

Every occupant of a dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming house, or rooming unit shall give the owner thereof, or his agent or employee, access to any part of such dwelling or dwelling unit and its premises at all reasonable times for the purpose of making such repairs or alterations as are necessary to effect compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance or with any lawful order issued pursuant to the provisions of this Ordinance. (Note: When permission to inspect a dwelling or its premises is denied, the Planning Director must obtain a warrant to inspect. B.S. 15-27.2 provides for the issuance of warrants for the conduct of inspections authorized by law. The NC Court of Appeals, In Re Dwelling, 24 NC App. 17 (1974), has held that the consent of the tenant occupant who was in actual possession and control of the premises was sufficient to authorize an inspection without a warrant, notwithstanding the fact that the owner has objected to the warrant less search. When faced with a situation where permission to inspect is denied, Planning Directors are advised to seek the advice of the city or town attorney.)
N. PROCEDURE FOR ENFORCEMENT
1. PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION; NOTICE; HEARING

Unified Development Ordinance
Page 8-10
2. PROCEDURE AFTER HEARING

Such order may also direct and require the owner to vacate and close such dwelling or dwelling unit until such repairs, alterations, and improvements have been made. If the Planning Director determines that the dwelling is dilapidated, he shall state in writing his finding of fact to support such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner either to repair, alter or improve such dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards of fitness established by this ordinance, or else to vacate and remove or demolish the same within a specified period of time not to exceed ninety (90) days.

(a) IN PERSONAM REMEDY. If the owner of any deteriorated dwelling or dwelling unit shall fail to comply with an order of the Planning Director to repair, alter, or improve or to vacate and close the same within the dwelling unit shall fail to comply with an order of the Planning Director to repair, alter or improve or to vacate and close and remove or demolish the same within the time specified therein, the Planning Director shall submit to the Town Council at its next regular meeting a resolution directing the Town Attorney to petition the superior court for an order directing such owner to comply with the order of the Planning Director, as authorized by G.S. 160A-446(g).

Such restraining order may be granted for due cause shown upon not less than one day's written notice to the Planning Director, by the Board, or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to G.S. 160A-446(f) and 8.2(N)(5) of this Section.
The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all appeals, shall give due notice to all the parties, and shall render its decision within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision or order appealed from, and may make such decision and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to that end it shall have all

Page 8-11
the powers of the Planning Director, but the concurring vote of four members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the Planning Director.

8.3 NON-RESIDENTIAL MAINTENANCE STANDARDS
A. CONDEMNATION OF BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES, GENERALLY
The Planning Director shall declare unsafe any building which appears to be especially dangerous to life because of its liability to fire or because of bad condition of walls, overloaded floors, defective construction, decay, unsafe wiring or heating system, inadequate means of egress, or other causes. In such event, the Planning Director shall affix a notice of the dangerous character of the structure to a conspicuous place on the exterior wall of the building.
B. CONDEMNATION OF NONRESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES
The Planning Director, as necessary, may declare a nonresidential building or structure within a community development target area to be unsafe if it meets both of the following conditions:
1. It appears to be vacant or abandoned.
2. It appears to be in such a dilapidated condition as to cause or contribute to blight, disease, vagrancy, fire or safety hazard, to be a danger to children, or to tend to attract persons intent on criminal activities or other activities which would constitute a public nuisance.
If the Planning Director declares a nonresidential building or structure to be unsafe, the Planning Director must affix a notice of the unsafe character of the structure to a conspicuous place on the exterior wall of the building. For the purposes of this subsection, the term "community development target area" means an area that has characteristics of a development zone under G.S. § 105-129.3A, a "nonresidential development area" under G.S. § 160A-503(10), or an area with similar characteristics designated by Town Council as being in special need of revitalization for the benefit and welfare of its citizens.
C. ACTION IN EVENT OF FAILURE TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION
If the owner of a building or structure that has been condemned as unsafe pursuant to this article shall fail to take prompt corrective action, the Planning Director shall give him written notice, by certified or registered mail to his last known address or by personal service, of the following:
1. That the building or structure is in a condition that appears to meet one or more of the following conditions:
(a) Constitutes a fire or safety hazard;
(b) Is dangerous to life, health, or other property;
(c) Is likely to cause or contribute to blight, disease, vagrancy, or danger to children;
(d) Has a tendency to attract persons intent on criminal activities or other activities which would constitute a public nuisance.

3. That following the hearing, the Planning Director may issue such order to repair, close, vacate, or demolish the building or structure as appears appropriate.
If the name or whereabouts of the owner cannot after due diligence be discovered, the notice shall be considered properly and adequately served if a copy thereof is posed on the outside of the building or structure at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing and a notice of the hearing is published in a newspaper having general circulation in the town at least once not later than one (1) week prior to the hearing.
D. EQUITABLE ENFORCEMENT
1. In the case of a nonresidential building or structure declared unsafe under this article, the town may, in lieu of seeking civil enforcement under G.S. § 160A-432(a), cause the building or structure to be removed or demolished. The amounts incurred by the town in connection with the removal or demolition shall be a lien against the real property upon which the cost was incurred. The lien shall be filed, have the same priority, and
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 8: Maintenance Standards
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 8-14
be collected in the same manner as liens for special assessments provided in Article 10 of Chapter 160A, G.S. If the building or structure is removed or demolished by the town, the town shall sell the usable materials of the building and any personal property, fixtures, or appurtenances found in or attached to the building. The town shall credit the proceeds of the sale against the cost of the removal or demolition. Any balance remaining from the sale shall be deposited with the Clerk of Superior Court of Duplin County and shall be disbursed by the court to the person found to be entitled thereto.
2. Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit the power of the town to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.
E. APPEALS

Provided, however, nothing herein shall preclude the County Building Inspector from requiring that corrective action be taken in a lesser period of time upon finding that there is imminent danger to life or other property.
F. APPLICABILITY AND COMPLIANCE

The owner shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint. Any person desiring to do so may attend such hearing and give evidence relevant to the matter being heard. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings before the Planning Director. Following the hearing, the Planning Director shall dismiss the complaint if he finds no violation; if he finds that violations of this article exist, he shall order compliance setting forth a maximum of up to 180 days within which to correct the violations. Such order shall contain an outline of remedial action which, if taken, will effect compliance with the provisions of this article.

When an appeal is from a decision of the chief Planning Director refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When any appeal is from a decision of the Planning Director requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the board, unless the Planning Director certifies to the board after the notice of appeal is filed with him, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished to the appellant), a suspension of his requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case, the requirement shall not be suspended except by a restraining order, which may be granted for due cause upon not less than one day's written notice to the Planning Director by the board, or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to Section 8.3(L)(4) of this section. All regulations, fees and other rules of the board shall apply to these appeals.
2. The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all appeals, shall give due notice to all the parties, and shall render its decision within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The board may reverse or affirm wholly or partly, or may modify the decision or order appealed from, and may make such decision and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to that end it shall have all the powers of the Planning Director, but the concurring vote of 4/5 of the members of the board shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the Planning Director. The board shall have power also in passing upon appeals, in any case where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the ordinance, to adapt the application of the ordinance to the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
3. If the board determines that the building is a building of historical value, the board may enter an order holding the matter in abeyance provided that the owner repairs the building on a timely basis. Such repairs shall commence within six (6) months of the board's order and shall be completed within two (2) years of said date. All such repairs shall be completed in such a way as to maintain the historic character of the building and shall comply with the United States Secretary of Interior standards for the treatment of historic rehabilitation. If the repairs are not commenced and completed within the time periods set out in the order, the Planning Director shall proceed to enforce his original order.

If a person fails to pay the civil penalty within ten (10) days of receipt of the citation, the town may seek to collect it in a civil action in the nature of a debt.

8.4 PREVENTION OF DEMOLITION BY NEGLECT
A. INTENT
The purpose of this Ordinance is to permit the Town of Wallace, through its Historic District Commission and its Planning Department, to protect the Town’s historic architectural resources by intervening when a significant resource is undergoing demolition by neglect.
Demolition by neglect occurs when the condition of an improved property located in the Historic District is deteriorating in such a way as to threaten the structural integrity or the relevant, significant architectural detail of the structure such that the structure or its character may be lost to current and future generations.
A significant resource, as the term is used in this Ordinance, is defined as any property, structure or architectural resource designated as “contributing” in the Wallace Historic District’s nomination to the National Register of Historic Place.
B. STANDARDS
The exterior features of the building or structure found to have significance (the term is defined above) located within the Historic District shall be preserved by the owner, or such other person as may have legal possession, custody, and control thereof, against decay and deterioration and kept free from structural defects. The owner, or other person having such legal possession, custody, and control, shall upon written request by the Town, stabilize or
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 8: Maintenance Standards
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 8-20
repair the exterior features of a significant building or structure if they are found to be deteriorating, or if their condition is contributing to deterioration of the property or the district. The following conditions are examples of (by way of illustration, but not limitation) defects which may constitute, or result in a finding of, demolition by neglect:
1. Deterioration of exterior walls, foundations, or other vertical support which results in leaning, sagging, splitting, listing, or buckling;
2. Deterioration of flooring or floor supports, roofs, or other horizontal members which results in leaning, sagging, splitting, listing, or buckling;
3. Deterioration of external chimneys which results in leaning, sagging, splitting, listing, or buckling of the chimney;
4. Deterioration or crumbling of exterior plasters or mortars where there is evidence that such condition exposes structural elements to decay;
5. Ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs, and foundations, including broken windows or doors or broken or malfunctioning gutters;
6. Defective protection or lack of weather protection for exterior wall and roof coverings, including lack of paint, or weathering due to lack of paint or other protective covering;
7. Rotting, holes, and other forms of decay where there is evidence that such condition has exposed structural elements;
8. Deterioration of exterior stairs, porches, handrails, window and door frames, cornices, entablatures, wall facings, and architectural details that causes delamination, instability, loss of shape and form, or crumbling;
9. Deterioration of contributing accessory structures; or
10. Overgrown plants/landscaping features which threaten the structural integrity or relevant, significant architectural detail of a structure.
C. PROCEDURE FOR ENFORCEMENT
1. Any citizen who believes demolition by neglect is occurring with respect to any particular property in the Historic District, may make a written complaint to the Planning Department. The Planning Department may also initiate this enforcement process by filing a written complaint. Such a complaint must include a clear description of the property and the nature of the deterioration claimed to constitute demolition by neglect.
2. Upon the receipt of a complaint, the Planning Director will conduct a preliminary investigation and prepare a staff report concerning the property which is the subject of the complaint. The Planning Director may inspect the entire property as part of its investigation, and is not limited in its investigation to the specific conditions identified in the original complaint. The Planning Director, when conducting the preliminary investigation, may consult with professionals including, but not limited to, architects, landscape architects, engineers, building inspectors and historic preservationists, during the investigation.
3. The Planning Director shall make a written report of its preliminary inspection. If, upon investigation, the Planning Director determines that a structure may be undergoing demolition by neglect, it will notify the property owner in writing that a complaint and staff report concerning the property will be brought before the Historic District Commission at a meeting held no fewer than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty (60) days from the date of the notice. If the preliminary investigation does not substantiate the complaint, the complaint will be considered resolved and no further action will be taken.
4. The notice to the property owner shall include a copy of the Planning Director report concerning the structure, a description of the demolition by neglect review process, how the property owner can resolve the issue immediately, and a list of financial resources which may be available to assist the owner.
5. The Planning Director will forward the complaint and staff report to the Historic District Commission to be considered at its next regularly scheduled meeting within the time period described in Section 8.4(C)(3) above.
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 8: Maintenance Standards
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 8-21
6. The Historic District Commission will review the complaint and staff report at a regular meeting.
7. If the Historic District Commission finds that the structure may be undergoing demolition by neglect, it shall file an order directing the Planning Director conduct a hearing to determine whether the subject property is undergoing demolition by neglect. The order shall describe the demolition by neglect found during the Planning Director’s preliminary inspection of the full property.
8. Whenever such an order is filed with the Planning Director, a copy shall be mailed to the property owner or such other person as may have legal possession, custody or control of the property. The Planning Director shall also issue and cause to be delivered to the owner and/or such other person who may have legal possession, custody, and control thereof, as the same may be determined by reasonable diligence, a written Notice stating that the Historic District Commission has reason to believe that the property is undergoing demolition by neglect, identifying the specific condition(s) at the property which have led to that determination, and advising that a hearing will be held before the Planning Director at a place within the Town not less than thirty (30) nor more than forty-five (45) days from the date of the Notice; that the owner and/or parties in interest have the right to answer and to give testimony at the hearing. The Historic District Commission shall also be given notice of the hearing. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings before the Planning Director. The purpose of the hearing is to receive evidence concerning the preliminary finding of demolition by neglect and to ascertain whether the owner and/or other parties in interest wish to file a claim of economic hardship with the Historic District Commission.
9. If after such hearing, the Planning Director determines that the structure is undergoing demolition by neglect because it is affected by one (1) or more of the conditions set out in Section 8.4(B), Standards, the Planning Director shall state in writing the findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be delivered to the owner and/or responsible persons (Section 9.3, Responsible Persons) an Order to Repair. The Order to Repair shall describe those elements of the structure that are deteriorating, contributing to deterioration, or deteriorated and which serve as the basis of the determination. The Owner and/or other responsible person shall have ten (10) business days from the date of the Planning Director’s written Order to Repair within which to file with the Historic District Commission a written petition for a claim of undue economic hardship. In the event that the owner and/or responsible person wishes to Petition for a claim of undue economic hardship, the Planning Director’s Order to Repair shall be stayed until after the Historic District Commission’s determination in accordance with the procedures of this code, except as provided in the Section 8.4(I), Other Town Powers.
10. The commencement and prosecution of work pursuant to the Order of Repair shall stay further enforcement activity under this Section 8.4(C), Procedure for Enforcement.
D. EVIDENCE OF UNDUE ECONOMIC HARDSHIP

All notices and orders shall be presumed to be received by the addresses five (5) days from the date of mailing.
F. SAFEGUARDS FROM UNDUE ECONOMIC HARDSHIP
Undue economic hardship is defined as the property owner’s financial inability to make the repairs specified in the Order to Repair pursuant to Section 8.4(C)(9). A claim of undue economic hardship must be made, in writing, by filing a request for such a determination with the Planning Department within the time period specified for in Section 8.4(C)(9). The determination of undue economic hardship will be made by the Historic District Commission on a case by case basis.
When a claim of undue economic hardship is made, the Planning Director shall notify the Commission within five (5) business days following the Planning Department’s receipt of the written request for a determination of undue hardship. The Commission shall schedule a hearing at its next available meeting.
The property owner and/or the responsible person shall present the information provided by Section 8.4(D)(1), For All Properties, and, where appropriate, 8.4(D)(1), For Income Producing Properties, to the Historic District Commission at least ten (10) days before the date of the hearing. The Commission may require that an owner and/or parties in interest furnish such additional information as the Commission may reasonably conclude is relevant to its determination of undue economic hardship, and may, in its sole discretion, hold the hearing open or close the hearing and allow the owner or party in interest additional time to furnish the requested additional information. The Commission may direct the Planning Director to furnish additional information, as the Commission believes is relevant. The Commission shall also state which form of financial proof it deems relevant and necessary to a particular case.

Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 8: Maintenance Standards
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 8-23
2. In the event of a determination that undue economic hardship exists, the finding shall be accompanied by recommended options that may be available to the property owner to relieve the economic hardship. This plan may include, but is not limited to, property tax relief as may be allowed under North Carolina law, loans or grants from the Town, the County, or other public, private, or nonprofit sources, acquisition by purchase or eminent domain, building code modifications, changes in applicable zoning regulations, or relaxation of the provisions of this article sufficient to mitigate the undue economic hardship. The Commission shall report such finding and plan to the Planning Director. The Planning Director shall cause to be issued an Order to Repair the property within a specified time.

To perfect such an appeal, a written application must be filed by an aggrieved party with the Board of Adjustment within thirty (30) calendar days of the date the determination was mailed to the property owner. Appeals shall be in the nature of certiorari (review of a quasi-judicial decision) such that the Board of Adjustment may review the record of the proceedings before the Planning Director or the Commission (as the case may be) to ensure that all procedures required by this Ordinance have been followed, and to ensure that the decision appealed from is supported by competent evidence in the record. However, the Board of Adjustment may not substitute its judgment for that of the Planning Director or the Historic District Commission unless it concludes that either (i) there has been an error of law or procedural error which has resulted in prejudice to the appellant or (ii) there is not substantial, competent evidence in the record to support the decision.

Chapter 10 – Definitions
10.1 RULES OF MEASUREMENT, COMPUTATIONS, AND EXCEPTIONS
A. PURPOSE
The purpose of this section is to clarify the general rules of measurement and exemptions that apply to all principal and accessory uses allowed in this Ordinance. This Ordinance may establish other standards for specific circumstances or situations, which specific standards supersede these general rules.
B. DISTANCE MEASUREMENTS, GENERALLY
Unless otherwise expressly stated, distances between points specified in this Ordinance are to be measured as the length of an imaginary straight line joining those points. Unless otherwise expressly stated, measurements determining the spacing between uses are to be taken from property line to nearest property line as a straight line measurement.
C. LOT MEASUREMENTS
1. LOT AREA
The total horizontal area within the boundary lines of a lot exclusive of street or highway rights-of-way and easements for access to other property. Utility and similar easements are included within a lot area.
2. LOT WIDTH
Lot width is the distance between the side lot lines measured along the front building setback line. In cases where a structure is “condominiumized,” or the interior floor area of a structure is owned by different owners, the zoning district lot width requirements shall apply only to the parent tract or development site, not the individual ownership units.
3. LOT DEPTH
The shortest perpendicular distance from the front lot line to the rear lot line.
4. LOT WIDTH AND DEPTH FOR CUL-DE-SAC LOTS
The permit issuing authority may allow the creation of new residential lots that do not meet the minimum lot width requirement at the front setback line if the sole reason for not meeting the minimum width is due to the reduced lot frontage on the public or private road created by the end of a cul-de-sac, provided the required lot width is met within 75’ measured from the edge of the right of way. The permit issuing authority may also allow construction in front of the lot width line, so long as the front setback is not less than the district minimum when measured from the edge of the right of way.
Figure 10-1
Wallace, North Carolina Adopted: 11/14/2013 Chapter 10: Definitions
Unified Development Ordinance
Page 10-3
D. GROSS RESIDENTIAL DENSITY MEASUREMENT
1. Gross residential density (the number of dwelling units per gross acre of land) shall be determined by dividing the total area of land within the boundaries of the parcel, including areas in public streets, rights-of-way and areas reserved as open space, by the minimum lot area for the district in which the parcel is located.
2. For sites being developed as attached dwellings, in cases where a site’s acreage allows a gross density that exceeds a whole number by 0.51 or more, the total density may be rounded up to the next whole number, thus allowing an additional dwelling unit to be located on a site.
E. SETBACKS
Setbacks are defined for each zoning district in Section 6.3, Dimensional Requirements. All structures and buildings must meet the setback requirements stated, unless the permit issuing authority modifies such setback pursuant to authority granted by this Ordinance, or dimensional variance is granted by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with Section 3.9.
1. Setback Measurements
A setback from a public street shall be measured from the street right-of-way line if such line is readily determinable in the field or by reference to a recorded map, set irons, or other means.
A setback from a property line shall be measured as the shortest perpendicular distance from the property line to the structure.
2. Permissible Encroachment into Required Setbacks
(a) One and two family driveways, walkways, fences, retaining or decorative walls, ornaments, furniture, and landscape plantings may be permitted in any setback.
(b) Patios may encroach into required setbacks, provided that the minimum patio setback is ten feet from a rear or side property line and provided that the patio surface is not more than 6 inches above the adjacent grade. Covered patios or patios with shade structures must observe the setback established for the district as set forth in Section 6.3, Dimensional Requirements.
(c) Accessory buildings may encroach into a side yard or rear yard setback not adjacent to a street right-of-way to within 5 feet of the property line, with the following limits:
i. For an accessory building with a highest point 12' or more above the ground elevation, an additional setback of 2' for each 1' of elevation above 12' is required until the standard setback is met.
ii. The setback being reduced is not part of a land use or stream buffer required elsewhere in this Ordinance, nor a recorded easement for utilities, drainage, or access.
(d) Parking lots and parking spaces are not allowed within setbacks.
(e) HVAC units and auxiliary power supplies (generators) are not allowed within setbacks.
(f) For setback provisions that apply to nonconforming lots of record, see Section 7.5, Nonconforming Lots of Record.

F. HEIGHT MEASUREMENT
1. The height of the side of a building or structure shall be the vertical distance measured from the mean elevation of the finished grade along that side of the building or structure to the highest point of that building or structure, not including a maximum four (4) foot parapet wall encroachment.
2. Subject to the remaining provisions of this section, no part of a building or structure in any district may exceed the height limit as indicated in Section 6.3, Dimensional Requirements.

(b) Antennas which are self-supported shafts of 6" in diameter or less, flag poles and similar devices;
(c) Solar collectors;
(d) Church spires and their ornamentation so long as they do not exceed such height by more than 10 feet if located within the Historic District overlay zone; and so long as they do not exceed such height by more than 20 feet when located outside the Historic District.
2. The permit issuing authority may authorize a structure to exceed the height limits set forth in Section 6.3, Dimensional Requirements so long as they do not exceed such height limitations by more than ten (10) feet when it concludes the following:
(a) There are sound architectural, structural, historical, or other reasons why the proposed structure should be allowed to exceed the normal height limits;
(b) That portion of the proposed building or structure that will exceed the height limit will be so located and/or buffered so that it will not be visually obtrusive or offensive in any substantial way, OR the total height of any addition to an existing building including any roof elements does not exceed the maximum height including any roof elements of the existing building;
(c) The Historic District Commission has granted a Certificate of Appropriateness for the project if it is located within the Historic District.
(d) Any adverse impact on neighboring properties is insignificant or is substantially outweighed by the hardship suffered by the applicant if the height exception is denied; and
(e) Adequate fire protection can be provided.
