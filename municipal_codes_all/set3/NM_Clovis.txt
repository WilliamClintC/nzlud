CLOVIS CITY CODE 1981 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
the City of Clovis, New Mexico 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 4, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

PREFACE 
    The Clovis, New Mexico Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1981, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement no. 4, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Harry L. Patton, city attorney. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 4, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 2105-2018, passed June 21, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06 can be added between Chapter 2.04 and Chapter 2.08. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 4, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 4, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 4, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 4, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 4, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Our e-mail address is: ords@municode.com.

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
    The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Includes." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omits."

Disclosure of financial interest or possible financial interest on any issue shall not disqualify the elected official from voting on the issue unless a majority of the remaining members determine that the elected official should not in propriety vote on the issue, or the elected official having a financial interest or possible financial interest voluntarily disqualifies himself.

A.  When a voter approaches the election polling place seeking to vote, the voter must identify herself or himself audibly by name. The municipal election clerk shall locate the registered voter's name as spoken and ask the individual seeking to vote for one current identification card containing the voter's name and photograph. 
B.  Such photo identification card may include any card issued by a government agency (federal, state, county or municipality), passport, driver's license, student identification card, state issued identification card, insurance card, union card, a professional association card or a voter identification card issued by the Clovis city clerk, provided the item submitted contains a photograph depiction of the voter. 
C.  If the individual is unable to provide a photo identification card, she or he shall be allowed to vote on a conditional ballot, but only if she or he swears or affirms under penalty of perjury in an affidavit provided by the city clerk that she or he is the registered voter listed on the voter registration rolls at the precinct at which she or he presented herself or himself to vote and provides her or his date of birth and the last four digits of her or his social security number. 
D.  Conditional ballots shall be issued for no other reason than the failure to present photo identification. Conditional ballots shall be counted only by the canvassing board and only on the voter's presentation to the city clerk, by nine a.m. on the third day following the election, one of the photo identification cards described in this section. The canvassing board shall also verify that the voter who cast the conditional ballot was registered to vote for the election and did not vote elsewhere in the same election. If a voter who cast a conditional ballot under this section swears or affirms under penalty of perjury in an affidavit provided by the city clerk within the three-day canvassing period that she or he has a religious objection to being photographed, such voter shall not be required to submit photo identification. The canvassing board shall otherwise verify that the conditional ballot was valid.

For statutory provisions authorizing municipalities to establish merit systems for municipal employees, see N.M. Stat. Ann. § 3-13-4. 

2.64.010 - Findings and determinations. 
A.  The Supreme Court of the state of New Mexico in the case of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers vs. Town of Farmington, 75 N.M. 393 (1965), held that if a merit system providing for those matters usually contained in a collective bargaining agreement is adopted by a municipality, the municipality may not enter into a collective bargaining agreement that is contrary to the provisions of the merit system. The city commission has considered alternative methods aimed at achieving the goals of protection of the rights of its employees, avoidance of employee dissatisfaction, assurance of access by employees to management, and input by employees into management decisions affecting wages, hours and other terms and conditions for employment. The city commission finds and determines that these goals can best be achieved through a formal merit system. 
B.  The city commission further finds and determines that all personnel actions regarding employees of the city shall be based upon the merit and fitness of all applicants, satisfactory performance of work involved, necessity to the municipality of the work to be performed, and the availability of funds. 
C.  The city commission further finds and determines that fair and equitable rates of pay shall be provided employees of the city with the due consideration of both employees and the taxpayers of the city, and in observance of the principle of equal pay for equal work and appropriate differences in pay for differences in work. 
D.  The city commission further finds and determines that as far as practicable, the public service in the city shall be made an attractive career and incentives shall be provided public employees so as to encourage efficient and effective delivery of services to the residents of the city.

D.  Within five days after service of a subpoena upon any person, such person may petition the chief administrative officer to revoke or modify the subpoena. The chief administrative officer shall grant the petition if they find that the subpoena requires appearance or attendance at an unreasonable time or place, that it requires production of evidence which does not relate to any matter under investigation, that it does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence to be produced, that compliance would be unduly onerous, or for other reason. 
E.  In case of contumacy of refusal to obey a subpoena the chief administrative officer, or other person at whose request it was issued, may petition for its enforcement in the municipal or state court for the district in which the person the subpoena was addressed resides, was served or transacts business.

The parties, by mutual agreement and approval of the board, may further consolidate occupational groups, however, such consolidations shall be city-wide. Essential factors in determining appropriate bargaining units shall include the principles of efficient administration of government, the history of collective bargaining with the employee, and the assurance to employees of their rights guaranteed by the ordinance.

(Ord. 1776-2004 §3(part), 2004).

A.  Whenever, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the board, a petition is filed by a labor organization containing the signatures of at least thirty percent of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit, the board shall post a notice to affected employees regarding the filed petition and proceed with the process for conducting a secret ballot representation election. 
B.  Once a labor organization has filed a petition with the board requesting a representation election, other labor organizations may seek to be placed on the ballot. Any labor organization may file a competing petition containing the signatures of not less than thirty percent of the employees in the appropriate bargaining unit no later than ten calendar days after the board has posted a written notice that a petition for a representation election has been filed by a labor organization. 
C.  All representation elections shall include the option for "no representation," except in a run-off election where the choice of "no representation" was not one of the two choices that received the highest vote. 
D.  In the event of an election with two or more labor organizations on the ballot and none of the choices on the ballot received a majority of the votes cast, then a run-off election shall be held within fifteen calendar days. The choices on the run-off election shall consist of the two choices which received the greatest number of votes in the original election. 
E.  A valid election requires that at least forty percent of the eligible employees in an appropriate bargaining unit cast a vote. In an election with only one labor organization, and the majority of the votes cast are in favor of representation, the board shall certify the labor organization as the exclusive representative for all the employees in the bargaining unit. 
F.  No election shall be conducted if an election has been conducted in the twelve-month period immediately preceding the proposed representation election. No election shall be held during the term of an existing collective bargaining agreement, except as provided in Section 12.94.130(B) of this chapter, or after the expiration of the third year of a collective bargaining agreement with a term of more than three years. 
G.  Election disputes shall be resolved by the board. 
H.  As an alternative to the provisions of subsection A of this section, the employer and a labor organization with a reasonable basis for claiming to represent a majority of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit may establish an alternative appropriate procedure for determining majority status. The procedure may include a labor organization's submission of authorization cards from a majority of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit. The local board shall not certify an appropriate bargaining unit if the employer objects to the certification without an election. 
(Ord. 1776-2004 §3(part), 2004). 
2.94.120 - Exclusive representation. 
    A labor organization that has been certified by the board as the exclusive representative for employees in an appropriate bargaining unit shall represent all employees in the bargaining unit. The exclusive representative shall act for all employees in the bargaining unit and negotiate a collective bargaining agreement covering all employees in the bargaining unit. The exclusive representative shall represent the interests of all employees in the bargaining unit without discrimination or regard to membership or nonmembership in the labor organization. The existence of an exclusive bargaining representative shall not prevent employees from taking their grievances through the grievance process or filing prohibited practices with the board. Any settlement of a grievance or relief given on a prohibited practice brought by an individual shall not be inconsistent with or in violation of the collective bargaining agreement in effect between the employer and the exclusive representative or inconsistent with or in violation of a memorandum of understanding between the employer and the exclusive representative in the day-to-day administration of the collective bargaining agreement. The exclusive representative shall be afforded the opportunity to be present at such hearings and make its views known. 
(Ord. 1776-2004 §3(part), 2004). 
2.94.130 - Decertification of exclusive representative. 
A.  Any member of a labor organization or the labor organization itself may initiate decertification of a labor organization as the exclusive representative if thirty percent of the employees in the appropriate bargaining unit make a written request to the board for a decertification election. A decertification election shall be valid only if at least forty percent of the eligible employees in the bargaining unit vote in the election. 
B.  When there is a collective bargaining agreement in effect, a request for a decertification election shall be made to the board no earlier than ninety days and no later than sixty days before the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement, provided, however, that a request for a decertification election may be filed at any time after the expiration of the third year of a collective bargaining agreement with a term of more than three years. 
C.  When, within the time period prescribed in subsection B of this section, a competing labor organization files a petition containing signatures of at least thirty percent of the employees in the appropriate bargaining unit, a representation election rather than a decertification election shall be conducted. 
D.  When an exclusive representative has been certified but no collective bargaining agreement is in effect, the board shall not accept a request for a decertification election earlier than twelve months subsequent to a labor organization's certification as the exclusive representative. 
(Ord. 1776-2004 §3(part), 2004). 
2.94.140 - Scope of bargaining. 
A.  Except for retirement programs provided under the Public Employment Retirement Act, and/or International City Manager's Association, the parties shall bargain in good faith on wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment and other issues agreed to by the parties. The parties shall enter into a written agreement covering employment relations regarding the issues agreed to in collective bargaining. 
B.  Bargaining in good faith shall not require either party to agree to a proposal or to make a concession. 
C.  The obligation to bargain collectively imposed by the labor management relations ordinance shall not be construed as authorizing employers and exclusive representatives to enter into any agreement that is in conflict with state statutes or federal statutes. In the event of conflict between the provision of any federal or state statutes and any agreement entered into by the employer and the exclusive representative, the former shall prevail. 
D.  Payroll deduction of the exclusive representatives' membership dues shall be a mandatory subject of bargaining if either party chooses to negotiate the issue. The amount of dues shall be certified in writing by an official of the labor organization and shall not include special assessments, penalties, or fines of any type levied by the exclusive representative. During the time that a board certification is in effect for a particular exclusive representative, the employer shall not deduct dues for any other labor organization from members of the same bargaining unit. 
E.  Fair share is a permissive subject of bargaining. 
F.  Any agreement or impasse resolution by the employer and an exclusive representative that requires the expenditure of funds shall be contingent upon the specific appropriation of funds by the governing body and the availability of funds to fund the agreed upon provision. An arbitrator's decision shall not require the reappropriation of funds. 
G.  The parties have a requirement that a grievance procedure culminating with final and binding arbitration be negotiated. This applies only to grievances and the interpretation and application of the agreement between the parties and does not apply to negotiation impasses. The parties shall share the cost of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this subsection. Each party is responsible for paying any cost related to its witnesses and representation. 
(Ord. 1784-2004 §2(part), 2004: Ord. 1776-2004 §3(part), 2004). 
2.94.150 - Negotiations and impasse resolution.

B.  The following negotiation procedures shall apply to the employer and exclusive representatives:

Subsequent requests for negotiations shall be postmarked no earlier than one hundred twenty days nor later than sixty days prior to the contract ending date or as negotiated by the parties. The parties may open negotiations at any time by mutual agreement. 
2.  All negotiations will be conducted in closed sessions. Negotiations will be held at a facility and at a time mutually agreed upon by the parties. 
3.  Recesses and study sessions may be called by either team. Prior to the conclusion of any negotiating sessions the reconvening time will be agreed upon. Caucuses may be taken as needed. 
4.  Tentative agreements reached during negotiations will be reduced to writing, dated, and initialed by each team spokesperson. Such tentative agreements are conditional and may be withdrawn should later discussion change either party's understanding of the language as it relates to another part of the agreement. 
5.  Agreement on contract negotiations is accomplished when the union president and the city manager sign the agreement. Provisions in multi-year agreements providing for economic increases for subsequent years shall be contingent upon the governing body appropriating the funds necessary to increase for the subsequent year(s).

Chapter 3.28 - ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2053-2015, § 1, adopted August 6, 2015, repealed the former Chapter 3.28, §§ 3.28.010-3.28.120, and § 2 of Ord. No. 2053-2015 enacted a new Chapter 3.28 as set out herein. The former Chapter 3.28 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 1498-96, 1996 and Ord. No. 2033-2014, adopted December 4, 2014. 

3.28.010 - Findings. 
    It is in the public interest of the city of Clovis, New Mexico, to afford all municipal assistance which is permitted by the authority vested in the city commission to assist the community of Clovis and its surrounding area to obtain new economic and industrial development projects. This municipal assistance benefits the public in Clovis and the region by providing employment opportunities through the creation of economic base jobs by furnishing new means of income and in general by improving the economic environment of Clovis. 
    It is important for the city of Clovis to attract and retain businesses capable of enhancing the local and state economy. 
    The city of Clovis needs to be able to provide industrial revenue bonds, local incentives, land, buildings and infrastructure as a tool for business growth and the introduction of business ventures into the area. It is in the best interest of the city of Clovis to encourage local or regional solutions to economic development. Access to public resources needs to be controlled and managed for the continued and future benefit of Clovis and the surrounding area. 
    It is the purpose of the ordinance codified in this chapter to implement the Local Economic Development Act, the 1994 constitutional amendment to Article 9, Section 14 of the New Mexico Constitution to allow public support of economic development to foster, promote and enhance local economic development efforts that create or retain jobs while continuing to protect against the unauthorized use of public money and other public resources. This act also allows the city of Clovis to enter into joint powers agreements to plan and support regional economic development projects, including investments in arts and cultural districts created pursuant to the Arts and Cultural District Act [15-5A-1 to 15-5A-7 NMSA 1978]. 
(Ord. No. 2053-2015, § 2, 8-6-15). 
3.28.020 - Definitions. 
    As used in this economic development plan ordinance: 
    "Arts and cultural district" means a developed district of public and private uses that is created pursuant to the Arts and Cultural District Act, NMSA 1978, §§ 15-5A-1 to 15-5A-7. 
    "Business" means the city, a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, syndicate, association or person that/who creates economic base jobs with a minimum of fifty percent of business revenue coming from a customer base outside the state of New Mexico. 
    "City" means the city of Clovis, New Mexico. 
    "Clovis Main Street Program" means all projects administered by Clovis Main Street, Inc. pursuant to the authorization of NMSA 1978, §§ 3-60B-1 to 3-60B-4. 
    "Cultural facility" means a facility that is owned by a political subdivision of the state that serves the public through preserving, educating and promoting the arts and culture of a particular locale, including theaters, museums, libraries, galleries, cultural compounds, educational organizations, performing arts venues and organizations, fine arts organizations and historical and cultural properties. 
    "Deal closing/relocation grant" means a grant program which is structured in the form of a forgivable loan which is typically awarded to major economic impact projects. A deal closing/relocation grant requires that the qualifying entity provide adequate security, including but not limited to, letters of credit, performance bonds, mortgage liens or other security agreeable to both parties. The city may reimburse a qualifying entity for land, building and infrastructure based upon the number of jobs created or retained, capital investment, wage levels, industrial revenue bond requirements, and other performance parameters. The city can reimburse the qualifying entity for expenses related to land, building and infrastructure before performance. Since the funds can be distributed before performance has taken place, the deal closing/relocation grant will require a higher level of investment by the qualifying entity and its investors. 
    "Economic base job, job, base job or primary job" means employment created by a business or qualifying entity that manufactures, assembles, or processes goods or products or a business that exports a minimum of fifty percent or more of their services or goods outside the state of New Mexico. 
    "Economic development project" or "project" means the provision of direct or indirect municipal assistance to a qualifying entity by the city and includes the issuance of industrial revenue bonds the purchase, lease, grant, construction, reconstruction, improvement or other acquisition or conveyance of land, buildings or other infrastructure; public works improvements essential to the location or expansion of a qualifying entity; payments for professional services contracts necessary for the City to implement a plan or project; the provision of direct loans or grants for land, buildings or infrastructure; technical assistance to cultural facilities; loan guarantees securing the cost of land, buildings or infrastructure in an amount not to exceed the revenue that may be derived from the municipal infrastructure gross receipts tax; grants for public works infrastructure improvements essential to the location or expansion of a qualifying entity; grants or subsidies to cultural facilities; purchase of land for a publicly held industrial park or a publicly owned cultural facility; and the construction of a building for use by a qualifying entity. 
    "Economic development tax fund or city of Clovis economic development tax fund" means the one-eighth municipal infrastructure gross receipts tax pursuant to the municipal local option gross receipts tax act Chapter 7, Article 19D NMSA 1978 dedicated to furthering and implementing economic development plans and projects as defined in the Local Economic Development Act. 
    "EIB Board" means the economic incentive board of the city of Clovis, New Mexico. 
    "Governing body" means the city commission. 
    "Infrastructure" means improvements including sanitary sewer lines, storm sewers and other drainage improvements, water, water rights, water lines and utilities infrastructure, streets, roadways and equipment. 
    "LEDA" means the Local Economic Development Act, NMSA 1978, §§ 5-10-1 to 5-10-13, as it now exists or as it may be amended in the future. 
    "Municipality" means the city of Clovis. 
    "Person" means an individual, corporation, association, partnership or other legal entity. 
    "Post-performance grant" means a reimbursement grant program for land, buildings and infrastructure for job creation/job retention for a qualifying entity. Grant payments are made on a post-performance basis over the term of the project participation agreement. The "qualifying entity" is required to meet specific milestones such as number of jobs created or retained, capital investment and other parameters which are described in a project participation agreement. Grant payments will be made after project performance is reported, verified and approved by the city commission. Post-performance grants are typically awarded to startup businesses, high-risk businesses, early stage or emerging technology businesses and small capital investment businesses. Since the economic development grant funding is distributed after performance, the post-performance grant program minimizes the risk of potential loss to the city of Clovis. 
    "Project participation agreement" means an agreement between a qualifying entity and the city of Clovis whereby the city provides assistance to an economic development project in exchange for the benefits received as set forth in this chapter and required by LEDA. 
    "Qualifying entity" means the city, a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, syndicate, association or person that is one or more of the following: 
1.  A City project utilizing funds from the city of Clovis economic development tax fund must be an economic development project and cannot be for the city's direct benefit; 
2.  A business that is an industry for the manufacturing, processing or assembling of agricultural or manufactured products; 
3.

(Ord. 1583-98 § 3(part), 1998). 
Article III - EXCAVATION STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES 

12.06.090 - Pavement cutting. 
A.  Should the excavation require the removal of sections of sidewalks, or sections of curb and gutter, these sections are to be removed to the nearest expansion joint, score line or saw-cut edge. If a concrete drive is to be installed, knockdown of the back of the curb is not permissible. If the installation requires the joining of dissimilar material, the joint must not be in the flow line. Valley gutters on reinstalled curb shall maintain existing flow lines and be constructed of minimum three thousand PSI concrete. 
B.  Pavement edges must be trimmed to a vertical face and aligned with the centerline of any trench. All cuts shall be either parallel or perpendicular to the street line except for drop inlet connection lines. 
(Ord. 1583-98 § 3(part), 1998). 
12.06.100 - Backfill requirements. 
A.  All excavations for which a permit has been issued shall be inspected prior to the replacement of any material. The public works department shall determine whether additional inspections are necessary during the filling and compaction of any excavation. All excavation shall be filled with no more than eight-inch lifts and shall be compacted with a tamper, roller, or approved compactor. No wheel rolling will be allowed. 
B.  All backfill material in the trench shall be thoroughly compacted to a minimum of ninety percent of the maximum density throughout as determined by ASTM D-1557, except that the top six inches of sub-grade material in local residential streets, and the top twelve inches of sub-grade material in arterial streets, shall be compacted to a minimum of ninety-five percent maximum density unless the backfill or sub-grade material contains thirty-five percent or more material passing the number two hundred sieve, in which the compaction shall not be less than ninety percent of maximum density. The moisture content of the backfill material shall not be more than three percent nor less than two percent of the optimum. The obtaining of the correct moisture content will be the responsibility of the applicant. Moisture and density requirements shall be governed by ASTM D-1557. The classification of the backfill required shall be shown in the application for the excavation permit. 
C.  Failed excavations shall be the responsibility of the applicant for one year after the excavation, and all such failed excavations shall be repaired within ten days after failure. Should any failed excavation not be repaired by the responsible applicant, the city may repair the excavation and charge the costs to the applicant. 
D.  When an excavation has been cut through existing pavement, the compaction for the top six inches or twelve inches, whichever may be the case, means the six inches or twelve inches of material placed immediately below the bottom or base of the existing pavement slab. The remainder of the backfill up to the top of the existing pavement surface is to be compacted sufficiently to provide a level and safe riding surface and maintained in that condition by the applicant until the permanent pavement patch can be installed. Pavement patches must be installed within ten days after completion of the backfill unless a longer period may be required by extreme weather conditions. 
E.  When existing asphalt has been disturbed, or when asphalt is to be placed on the street, tack oil will be required on all asphalt edges. Only hot asphalt is allowed, cold-mix can only be utilized for temporary patches until hot asphalt application can be completed. 
F.  In no event shall concrete or asphalt be applied to any street until the public work director or his designee has approved all sub-grade preparations. 
G.  The director is authorized to make or have made backfill moisture/density tests for the purpose of determining compliance with the compaction requirements of this section. Tests will not exceed one eight-inch lift per block of trench unless failures indicate the need for additional tests. Such tests are to be made in accordance with the Standard Procedures of the American Standards for Testing and Materials, including the latest revisions thereto. All costs connected with required testing will be made at the expense of the applicant. 
H.  In the event the completed backfill fails to meet the density requirements of this section when tested, the director shall order the faulty backfill material removed, replaced and recompacted to the required density specified by this chapter, and may retest the backfill, all at the applicant's expense. 
(Ord. 1583-98 § 3(part), 1998). 
12.06.110 - Resurfacing of excavations. 
    Permanent resurfacing may be done by the applicant or a licensed contractor hired by the applicant. The cost of resurfacing will be borne by the applicant. The applicant must resurface the excavation within a period of ten days after the completion of backfill, unless a longer period may be required by extreme weather conditions. The applicant shall be responsible for keeping the excavations safe for pedestrians and vehicular traffic until the pavement surface has been accepted. Acceptance of the resurfacing by the city does not relieve the applicant from the responsibility to repair failed excavations within ten days. 
(Ord. 1583-98 § 3(part), 1998). 
12.06.120 - Site cleanup. 
    As the excavation work progresses, the excavation area shall be thoroughly cleaned of all rubbish, excess earth, rock and other debris resulting from the work. All cleanup operations shall be accomplished at the expense of the applicant. Should the applicant fail to complete cleanup work within twenty-four hours after notice from the director to do so, the cleanup work may be done by the city and the cost thereof charged to the applicant. 
(Ord. 1583-98 § 3(part), 1998). 
Article IV - UTILITIES

    Tracts of raw land are located in or near the corporate limits of the city which are to be developed in the future as sites for the construction of residences, or commercial buildings, or for such other uses as might be appropriate. Aside from an informal policy prohibiting the extension of sewage disposal services outside its corporate limits, the city commission has never established a policy governing the extension of municipal sewage facilities to new subdivisions. It is the purpose of this chapter to establish such a policy, for the future guidance of the city administration and the owners of property subject to development. 
(Ord. 1164-80 § 1, 1980). 
13.08.020 - Preparation of plans. 
    Whenever the city administration receives any application for approval of a new subdivision over which the city has jurisdiction, the city administration will cause plans for the extension of sewage disposal facilities to the new subdivision to be prepared. The plans may, if necessary in the opinion of the city manager, be prepared by a registered professional engineer, and shall in any event comply with all city regulations applicable to the construction of sewage disposal lines and facilities. The plans shall include an estimated cost of constructing the necessary sewage facilities and of acquiring right-of-way, if any. 
(Ord. 1164-80 § 2, 1980).

Upon acceptance of the construction plans by the owner and the city, the owner shall deposit with the city treasurer a sum equal to the estimated total cost of the sewer construction. Sewer construction shall then be commenced and completed, either by a licensed independent contractor or by municipal personnel, if available. The deposit by the owner shall constitute an advance in aid of construction, and shall not be refundable except as provided in this chapter. All sewage facilities constructed pursuant to this chapter shall become and remain the property of the city, and the city shall be responsible for all maintenance, upkeep, repair and replacement of such sewage facilities. 
(Ord. 1164-80 § 3, 1980). 
13.08.040 - Refund of extension costs. 
    In the event the proposed line extension crosses property not belonging to the owner of the proposed subdivision, the plans shall include a statement of the portion of the costs of extension construction which, in the opinion of the individual preparing the plans and specifications, benefits property other than that belonging to the owner of the subdivision. At such time as the intervening property is developed and requires wastewater disposal service, the city will refund to the owner of the proposed subdivision that portion of the initial cost of the sewer line extension which was determined to be a benefit to the intervening property. In no event shall any refund be made more than five years after the date of the deposit with the city treasurer of the owner's advance in aid of construction. 
(Ord. 1164-80 § 4, 1980). 
13.08.050 - Acquisition and costs of rights-of-way. 
    The owner of the proposed subdivision shall furnish the city with all necessary rights-of-way for the construction of the proposed sewer extension, whether or not such rights-of-way are located within the proposed subdivision. Any costs incurred by the owner in obtaining rights-of-way shall be included as a total cost of the development of the proposed sewer line extension. Repayment of right-of-way costs shall be made in the same fashion as repayment of the construction costs. The city will, at the request of the owner of the proposed subdivision, exercise its powers of eminent domain in the acquisition of rights-of-way. 
(Ord. 1164-80 § 5, 1980). 
13.08.060 - Individual disposal facilities when city service unavailable. 
    Whenever the city administration receives any application for approval of a new subdivision over which the city has jurisdiction, and the city manager, upon the completion of appropriate engineering studies, determines that sewage disposal service cannot be made available to that proposed subdivision by the city, the city manager shall so certify to the owner of the proposed subdivision. The owner of the proposed subdivision shall thereafter make such plans for individual sewage disposal facilities as may be required by state or federal law or regulation. 
(Ord. 1164-80 § 6, 1980). 
13.08.070 - Final approval of proposed new subdivisions. 
    The planning commission shall not give its final approval to any proposed new subdivision unless: (a) the owner of the proposed subdivision has made the deposit of the advance in aid of construction as required by Section 13.08.030, or (b) the owner of the subdivision has been furnished a certificate that no sewage disposal services can be furnished to the subdivision by the city, as required by Section 13.08.060.

3.  Unusual COD and BOD or chlorine requirements in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the wastewater treatment works, 
4.  Slugs or shocks constituting an unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes which will disturb the normal functioning of the wastewater facility; 
D.  Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment works employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the effluent cannot meet the requirements of agencies having jurisdiction over discharge of wastewater. 
(Ord. 1424-92 § 2(part), 1992). 
13.12.070 - Remedies for deleterious or hazardous discharges. 
A.  If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in Section 13.12.060, and which in the judgment of the city manager may have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater facility, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the city manager may: 
1.  Reject the waters or wastes; 
2.  Require pretreatment of the waters or wastes to any acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers; or 
3.  Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge of the waters or wastes. 
B.  If the city manager permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the city manager and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws. 
(Ord. 1424-92 § 2(part), 1992). 
13.12.080 - Use of grease, oil and sand traps-Inspection and administrative fees. 
A.  Grease, oil and sand traps shall be provided when, in the opinion of the city manager they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients; except that such traps shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All traps shall be of a type and capacity approved by the city manager and shall be so located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Grease and oil traps shall be installed in all new filling stations, garages, restaurants and other new facilities wherein heavy discharge of grease and oil is to be expected. 
B.  In each instance of a backup, overflow or operational defect of a grease, oil or sand trap reported to city enforcement personnel, the owner of the facility shall be assessed an inspection fee of fifty dollars for each incident or violation. 
C.  If such instance results in backup or overflow into a city main line which necessitates emergency action of any type other than normal maintenance, the owner of the facility that caused the backup or overflow shall be assessed a fee of five hundred dollars or the actual cost of such emergency maintenance, whichever is greater, for each incident or violation. 
(Ord. 1455-94 § 2, 1994: Ord. 1424-92 § 2(part), 1992). 
13.12.090 - Testing and measurement frequency and cost payment. 
    Testing of an industrial waste will be performed at least twice a year or whenever found necessary by the city manager. The person discharging the waste shall be liable for payment of all costs arising from the testing of the industrial waste. 
(Ord. 1424-92 § 2(part), 1992). 
13.12.100 - Test standards. 
    All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes shall be determined in accordance with the standard methods and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at the said control manhole. The control manhole shall be so located that the sampling of the industrial waste will be performed before discharge into the public sewer system. 
    Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of the constituents upon the wastewater treatment works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, COD, BOD and settleable solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four hour composite of all outfalls, whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples.) 
(Ord. 1424-92 § 2(part), 1992). 
13.12.110 - Maintenance of preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities. 
    Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any industrial liquid wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense. 
(Ord. 1424-92 § 2(part), 1992). 
13.12.120 - Use of control manholes and right to enter premises. 
    When required by the city manager, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial liquid waste shall install a suitable control manhole to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. 
    Such manhole, when required, shall be accessible and safely located, constructed in such a manner as to prevent infiltration of ground and surface waters, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the city manager. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
    The city manager or his authorized agents, bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter upon all properties for the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and testing, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. 1424-92 § 2(part), 1992). 
13.12.130 - Rates. 
    The city commission shall take necessary steps to establish a rate schedule for sewer service that assures an equitable system of sewer user charges. The purpose hereof is that the industrial users shall pay for the costs incurred by the city in construction, operation and maintenance of that portion of the wastewater facility related to industrial wastes. 
(Ord. 1424-92 § 2(part), 1992). 
13.12.140 - Sewer user charge. 
    The sewer user charge system shall satisfy the following conditions: 
A.  The apportionment of costs must take into consideration the individual industrial user's contribution as related to the total waste load, taking into account the volume and strength of all discharges; 
B.  The costs to be considered should include, but are not limited to: 
1.  Amortization of the city's indebtedness for the cost of the treatment facilities (plant and interceptors), 
2.  Operation and maintenance of the treatment facilities, 
3.  Any additional costs which are necessary to assure adequate treatment on a continuous basis, 
4.  Recovery of a portion of the capital replacement cost of this treatment facility; 
C.  Substantial payment of a capital replacement fund shall be included in its costs from each industry that contributes in excess of the domestic waste load to be treated by the project. 
(Ord. 1424-92 § 2(part), 1992). 
13.12.150 - Industrial waste charges. 
    A charge will be assessed against persons discharging industrial liquid wastes which are of greater strength and volume than normal, untreated domestic wastewater. Normal untreated domestic wastewater is defined as having a daily flow of two hundred fifty gallons per day and a maximum yearly average BOD not in excess of two hundred twenty milligrams per liter and a maximum yearly average SS not in excess of two hundred fifty milligrams per liter. 
    The user shall furnish the city documentation of the wastewater flow (water use) for each year. The industrial charge shall be in addition to basic sewer service charges indicated in Section 13.04.100 of this code. 
    Percentage allocation of basic rate to volume, BOD, and SS is as follows: 
Volume = 57% BOD = 23% SS = 20% 100%  
    The industrial user charge shall be calculated using the following mathematical relationship: 
Ic = AV + V [B (BOD-220) 
220 + C (SS-220) ] 
220  
where, 
Ic = Industrial charge per working day 
V = Volume of wastewater in 1000 gal/day 
A = Cost of treatment per 1000 gal/day of flow = $1.12 
B = Cost of treatment per 1000 gal/day of BOD at 220 mg/l = $0.46 
C = Cost of treatment per 1000 gal/day of suspended solids at 220 mg/l = $0.39 
Basic rate for treatment of normal domestic wastewater = $1.64/1000 gal 
    If the measured BOD is less than two hundred twenty mg/l and/or the measured SS is less than two hundred twenty mg/l, then in the above equation, the value of BOD will be assumed two hundred twenty mg/l and/or the value of SS will be assumed two hundred twenty mg/l respectively. 
(Ord. 1822-2005 § 2(B), 2005: Ord. 1424-92 § 2(part), 1992). 
13.12.160 - Measurement of volume of flow. 
    The volume of flow used in computing the industrial waste charges shall be based upon metered water consumption as shown in the records of meter readings maintained by the water utility company. In the event that a person discharging industrial waste into the city's sewer system produces evidence to the city manager demonstrating that a substantial portion of the total amount of water used for all purposes does not reach the city's sewer system, an estimated percentage of total water consumption to be used in computing charges may be established by the city manager. 
    Any person discharging industrial waste into the sewers of the city who procures any part or all of his water supply from sources other than the water utility company, all or part of which is discharged into the city's sewer, shall install and maintain at his expense water meters of the type approved by the city manager for the purpose of determining the proper volume of flow to be used in computing the industrial waste charges. Such meters shall be read monthly and tested for accuracy when deemed necessary by the city manager. Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the city manager that a substantial portion of the water as measured by such meters, does not enter the sewer system of the city, the city manager may require or permit the installation of additional meters at the owner's expense, in such manner as to measure the quantity of water actually entering such sewer system from the lot, parcel of land, building or premises of such owner or other person or occupant, and the quantity of water used to determine the industrial waste charges may be the quantity of water actually entering the sewer system as so determined, if the city manager so elects. If the city manager finds that it is not practicable to measure the quantity or quality of waste by such meters or monitoring devices, he shall determine the quantity or quality of the waste in any manner or method he may find practicable, in order to arrive at the percentage of water entering the sewer system of the city and the quality of the sewage to be used to determine the industrial waste charges. 
(Ord. 1424-92 § 2(part), 1992). 
13.12.170 - Measurement of BOD. 
    The BOD used in computing the industrial waste charges for a particular year and for a particular industry shall be the simple average of at least five to seven consecutive days BOD of the effluent from the industry, which is discharged into the city's sewer system. The five to seven days time period will be based on the number of working days per week for the particular industry. There shall be at least two sampling events for a particular year, each comprising of five to seven consecutive days as mentioned. The sample collected for BOD measurement shall be either a flow-weighted composite sample or a time-weighted composite sample, whichever seems feasible to the city manager during the period of such sampling event. The user (the industry) may, however, provide the city with any number of sampling and testing data of their effluent for calculating the average BOD. The user supplied data shall contain at least five consecutive working days sampling and testing shall be done in accordance with the procedures described in the standard methods. In addition, all testings shall be performed in a state certified laboratory. The user shall have to get pre-approval from the city manager regarding the sampling location and whether the sample be time-composite or flow-composite. 
(Ord. 1424-92 § 2(part), 1992). 
13.12.180 - Measurement of SS. 
    The SS used in computing the industrial waste charges for a particular year and for a particular industry shall be the simple average of at least five to seven consecutive days' SS of the effluent from that industry, which is discharged into the city's sewer system. The five to seven days time period will be based on the number of working days per week for the particular industry. There shall be at least two sampling events for a particular year, each comprising of five to seven consecutive days as mentioned. The sample collected for SS measurement shall be either a flow-weighted composite sample or a time-weighted composite sample, whichever seems feasible to the city manager during the period of such sampling event. The user (the industry) may, however, provide the city with any number of sampling and testing data of their effluent for calculating the average SS. The user-supplied data shall contain at least five consecutive working days sampling and testing results for SS. All sampling and testing shall be done in accordance with the procedures described in the standard methods. In addition, all testings shall be performed in a state certified laboratory. The user shall have to get preapproval from the city manager regarding the sampling location and whether the sample be time-composite or flow-composite. 
(Ord. 1424-92 § 2(part), 1992). 
13.12.190 - Penalty for violation. 
    Every person convicted of a violation of this chapter shall be punished, pursuant to NMSA 3-17-1C(3) to pay a fine of not more than nine hundred ninety-nine dollars or shall be imprisoned in the county jail for not more than ninety days, or shall be sentenced to both such fine and imprisonment. Each day this chapter is violated shall constitute a separate offense. The conviction and punishment of any person for a violation shall not excuse or exempt such person from the payment of any fee due or unpaid at the time of such conviction. 
    All remedies prescribed or liens created hereunder or under the provisions of the law for collection and enforcement of the fees shall be cumulative and the use of one or more remedies by the city shall not bar the use of any other remedy for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter or any liens created by the law. The fees fixed by this chapter shall be a lien in favor of the city upon the personal property of the person used in connection with the sewer use which gave rise to the fee and such lien shall be imposed, collected, enforced and paid as provided by law. No property of any person shall be exempt from levy and sale of execution issued for the collection of a judgment for any fee imposed by this chapter. 
(Ord. 1424-92 § 2(part), 1992). 
13.12.200 - Review and amendment of industrial waste charges. 
    The city commission may, every two years, review those factors in the formula established by Section 13.12.150 that relate to costs and may increase or decrease such factors to reflect the changes substantiated by operational experience. 
(Ord. 1424-92 § 2(part), 1992).

Chapter 15.32 - FLOOD HAZARD AREAS[11] 

Footnotes: 
--- (11) --- 
Prior history: Prior code §§ 5-57-5-64; Ords. 1168-81 and 1153-80. 

15.32.010 - Findings of fact. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of the city, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. 1312-87 (part), 1987). 
15.32.020 - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed: 
A.  To protect human life and health; 
B.  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F.  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
G.  To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
H.  To insure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. 1312-87 (part), 1987). 
15.32.030 - Content. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance includes methods and provisions for: 
A.  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwater; 
D.  Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
E.  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. 1312-87 (part), 1987). 
15.32.040 - Interpretation. 
    In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: 
A.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
B.  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
C.  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(Ord. 1312-87 (part), 1987). 
15.32.050 - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
A.  "Alluvial fan flooding" means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
B.  "Area of special flood hazard" is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone A usually is refined in Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
C.  "Base flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
D.  "City" means the city of Clovis, New Mexico. 
E.  "Critical feature" means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
F.  "Development" means any man-made change to improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
G.  "Elevated building" means a nonbasement building: 
1.  Built, in the case of a building in Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in Zones V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water; and 
2.  Adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of Zones V1-30, VE or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building," even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls meet the standards of Section 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
H.  "Existing construction" means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, the FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
I.  "Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
1.  The overflow of inland or tidal waters and/or; 
2.  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
J.  "Flood Insurance Rate Map" (FIRM), means the official map on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
K.  "Flood Insurance Study" is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the Flood Boundary-Floodway Map. 
L.  "Floodplain" or "flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of "flooding"). 
M.  "Flood protection system" means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
N.  "Floodway (regulatory floodway)" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
O.  "Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
1.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

4.  Individually listed on a local inventory or historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior, or 
b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
P.  "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
Q.  "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood- resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
R.  "Manufactured home" means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
S.  "Mean sea level" means for the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
T.  "New construction" means for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of any initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
U.  "Start of construction" (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Publ. L. 97-348)) means and includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
V.  "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
W.  "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: (1) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions or (2) Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
X.  "Variance" is a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations). 
Y.  "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b) (5), (C) (4), (c) (10), (d) (3), (e) (2), (e) (4), or (e) (5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
Z.  "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
AA.  "Apex" means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
BB.  "Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent chance or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
CC.  "Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
DD.  "Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
EE.  "Expansion to an existing manufacture home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
FF.  "Floodplain management" means, the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
GG.  "Floodplain management regulations" means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
HH.  "Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
II.  "Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
JJ.  "Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
KK.  "Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
LL.  "Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
MM.  "New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
NN.  "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis; (2) four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck: and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
OO.  "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

F.  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in Section 15.32.110 (B) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical jurisdiction required for issuing the variance increases. 
G.  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of Section 15.32.020. 
H.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
I.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that he proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
J.  Prerequisites for Granting Variances. 
1.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
2.  Variances shall only be issued upon (a) showing a good and sufficient cause; (b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (c) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
3.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
K.  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that (1) the criteria outlined in Section 15.32.120 A-J are met, and (2) the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(Ord. 1598-99 § 2(F), 1999: Ord. 1312-87 (part), 1987).

B.  Specific Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in (i) Section 15.32.070, (ii) Section 15.32.100 (H) or (iii) Section 15.32.130(C)(3), the following provisions are required: 
1.  Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in Section 15.32.110(A)(1), is satisfied. 
2.  Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
3.  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
4.  Manufactured Homes. 
a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Require that manufactured homes be placed substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (B)(4) of this section be elevated so that either: 
i.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation, or 
ii.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
5.  Recreational Vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM either (i) be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days, (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or (iii) meet the permit requirements of Section 15.32.110(A), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in subsection (B)(4) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
C.  Standards for Subdivision Proposals. 
1.  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with Sections 15.32.010, 15.32.020, and 15.32.030. 
2.  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet development permit requirements of Section 15.32.080, Section 15.32.110 and the provisions of Section 15.32.130. 
3.  Base flood evaluation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than fifty lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to Section 15.32.070 or Section 15.32.100(H). 
4.  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
5.  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivision shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
D.  Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO/AH Zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.32.070 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
1.  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
2.  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures: 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
3.  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in Section 15.32.110(A)(1) are satisfied. 
4.  Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

(Ord. 1022 § 2, 1974). 
16.08.030 - Zones established and defined. 
    In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying within the noninstrument approach zones, transition zones, horizontal zone and conical zone, Such areas and zones are shown on the Clovis Municipal Airport zoning map consisting of one sheet, prepared by Lydick Engineers and Surveyors, and dated September 1, 1970, which is attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter and is made a part hereof as though set forth in this chapter. The various zones are established and defined as follows: 
A.  Noninstrument Approach Zone. A noninstrument approach zone is established at each end of all runways for noninstrument landings and takeoffs. The noninstrument approach zone shall have a width of five hundred feet at a distance of two hundred feet beyond each end of the runways, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of two thousand five hundred feet at a distance of ten thousand two hundred feet beyond each end of the runway, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
B.  Transition Zones. Transition zones are established adjacent to each runway and approach zone as indicated on the zoning map. Transition zones symmetrically located on either side of runways have variable widths as shown on the zoning map. Transition zones extend outward from a line two hundred fifty feet on either side of the centerline of the runways, for the length of such runways plus two hundred feet on each end, and are parallel and level with such runway centerlines. The transition zones along such runways slope upward and outward one foot vertically for each seven feet horizontally to the point where they intersect the surface of the horizontal zone. Further, transition zones are established adjacent to the noninstrument approach zones for the entire length of the approach zones. These transition zones have variable width, as shown on the zoning map. Such transition zones flare symmetrically with either side of the runway approach zones from the base of such zones and slope upward and outward at the rate of one foot vertically for each seven feet horizontally to the points where they intersect the surfaces of the horizontal and conical zones. 
C.  Horizontal Zone. A horizontal zone is established as the area within a circle with its center at the airport reference point and having a radius of seven thousand feet. The horizontal zone does not include noninstrument approach zones and the transition zones. 
D.  Conical zone. A conical zone is established as the area that commences as the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a distance of five thousand feet. The conical zone does not include the transition zones. 
(Ord. 1022 § 3, 1974). 
16.08.040 - Height limitations-Interpretation. 
A.  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure of tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in any zone created by this chapter to a height in excess of the height limit established in this section for such zone. Such height limitations are established for each of the zones in question as follows: 
1.  Noninstrument Approach Zones. One foot in height for each forty feet in horizontal distance beginning at a point two hundred feet from and at the centerline elevation of the end of the runways and extending to a point ten thousand two hundred feet from the end of the runway. 
2.  Transition Zones. One foot in height for each seven feet in horizontal distance beginning at any point two hundred fifty feet normal to and at the elevation of the centerline of each runway, extending two hundred feet beyond each end thereof, extending to a height of one hundred fifty feet above the airport elevation which is 4213.8 feet above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits of one foot of vertical height for each seven feet horizontal distance measured from the edges of all approach zones for the entire length of the approach zones and extending upward and outward to the points where they intersect the horizontal or conical surfaces. 
3.  Horizontal Zone. One hundred fifty feet above the airport elevation (which is declared to be 4213.8 feet above mean sea level at the approach reference point). 
4.  Conical Zone. One foot in height for each twenty feet of horizontal distance beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone, extending to a height of four hundred feet above the airport elevation. 
B.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting the growth, construction or maintenance of any tree or structure to a height up to seventy-five feet above the surface of the land except in noninstrument approach or transition zones. 
C.  Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the more restrictive limitation shall prevail. 
(Ord. 1022 § 4, 1974). 
16.08.050 - Land use restrictions. 
    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use may be made of land within any zone established by this chapter in such a manner as to create electrical interference with radio communications between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for flyers to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of flyers using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport or otherwise endanger the landing, taking off, or maneuvering of aircraft. 
(Ord. 1022 § 5, 1974). 
16.08.060 - Nonconforming uses. 
A.  The regulations prescribed by this chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this chapter, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing contained in this chapter shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, and is diligently prosecuted. 
B.  Notwithstanding the provision of subsection A, the owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the city manager to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport, the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the city. 
(Ord. 1022 § 6, 1974). 
16.08.070 - Permit-Required for certain changes of use. 
A.  Except as specifically provided in subdivisions 1, 2 and 3 of this section, no material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted or otherwise established in any zone created by this chapter unless a permit therefor has been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations prescribed in the chapter. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. 
1.  In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and the conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five feet of vertical height above the ground; except, when because of terrain, land contour or topographic features such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zone. 
2.  In the areas lying within the limits of the noninstrument approach zones but at a horizontal distance of not less than four thousand two hundred feet from each end of the runways, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such noninstrument approach zone. 
3.  In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five feet of vertical height above the ground except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones. 
B.  Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration or growth of any structure or tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this chapter except as set forth in Section 16.08.040. 
(Ord. 1022 § 7(a), 1974). 
16.08.080 - Permit-Not granted for creation of or increase in nonconformance. 
    No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on the effective date of this chapter or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated in this chapter, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
(Ord. 1022 § 7(b), 1974). 
16.08.090 - Permit-Not granted for abandoned or deteriorated nonconforming use. 
    Whenever the city manager determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than eighty percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
(Ord. 1022 § 7(c), 1974). 
16.08.100 - Variance required for certain nonconformance. 
    Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the board of adjustment for a variance from such regulations. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but will do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this chapter. 
(Ord. 1022 § 7(d), 1974). 
16.08.110 - Hazard marking and lighting may be required under permit or variance. 
    Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and be reasonable in the circumstances, be conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the city, at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard. 
(Ord. 1022 § 7 (e), 1974). 
16.08.120 - Administration and enforcement. 
    It shall be the duty of the city manager to administer and enforce the regulations prescribed in this chapter. Applications for permits and variances shall be made to the chairman upon a form furnished by him. Applications required by this chapter to be submitted to the chairman shall be promptly considered and granted or denied by him. Applications for action by the board of adjustment shall be forthwith transmitted by the chairman.

The clerk shall forthwith transmit to the board of adjustment all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
C.  An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the city manager certifies to the board of adjustment, after the notice of appeal has been filed with it, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by order of the board of adjustment on notice to the city manager and on due cause shown.

(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
Chapter 17.20 - ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS 

17.20.000 - Establishment of zoning districts. 
    The city is divided into the minimum number of zoning districts necessary to achieve compatibility of uses and character within each district, to implement the adopted Clovis comprehensive plan, and to achieve this title's purposes. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.20.010 - Zoning districts. 
    For the purpose of this title, all land and water areas in Clovis are divided into the following community character types and zoning districts, whose purposes are described in Sections 17.20.200-17.20.217: 
Zoning District 
Ranchette (RA) district 
Residential single-family (RS) district 
Neighborhood conservation (NC) district 
Residential (R) district 
Mixed development (MD) district 
Urban development (UD) district 
Industrial (I) district 
Planned redevelopment overlay district (PRO) 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.20.100 - Zoning map. 
    Zoning districts established by this title are bounded and defined as shown on the Clovis zoning map. The Clovis zoning map and all information on it are adopted by reference as a part of this title. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.20.110 - Interpretation of district boundaries. 
    The following rules shall be used to determine the precise location of any zoning district boundary line shown on the zoning map: 
A.  Boundaries shown as following, or approximately following, streets, alleys or railroads shall be construed as following the centerline of such features. 
B.  Boundary lines shown as following, or approximately following, lot lines, section lines, survey or other property lines, or municipal boundaries shall be construed as following such lines. 
C.  Boundaries shown as following, or approximately following, the centerline of streams or drainage channels shall be construed as following the channel centerline of such watercourses. 
D.  Boundaries shown as separated from, and parallel or approximately parallel to, any of the features listed in Section 17.20.110(A)-(C) shall be construed to be parallel to such features and at such distances as are shown on the zoning map. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.20.111 - New or unclassified land. 
    Any land not shown on the zoning map or not labeled on the zoning map shall be considered zoned RA. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.20.200 - Statement of purpose and intent of zoning districts. 
    Sections 17.20.210-17.20.217 specify the purpose and intent of the zoning districts established by this title. All districts share the purpose of implementing the comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.20.210 - Ranchette (RA) districts. 
    The ranchette (RA) district provides single-family residential uses where residents desire to engage in hobby farming or ranching, and where agriculture is encouraged as a primary land use. Clustering is permitted to enable a wider range of housing opportunities while still preserving the district's open character. The number of animals shall be limited to ensure nuisances are not created for the district's residents. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.20.211 - Residential single-family (RS) district. 
    The residential single-family (RS) district provides a generally suburban residential character in Clovis's newly developing areas. All housing units shall be single-family dwelling units; multifamily units are not permitted. However, many single-family dwelling unit types are available because of the numerous development options; to take advantage of a particular option, the developer must only provide the required open space. This district is designed to enhance new developments' open space characteristics. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.20.212 - Neighborhood conservation (NC) district. 
    The neighborhood conservation (NC) district is applied to single-family areas of Clovis already developed. Vacant lots remain within the NC district; this district designation ensures they continue to develop as single-family areas in character with the surrounding area. Special rules may be applied to areas in this district to accommodate changed conditions; such rules will ensure these areas continue to maintain their property values as desirable residential areas. Special land use or other rules are indicated by a letter designation on the zoning map following the NC designation; the use of those letters is explained in Section 17.30.210. For example, certain NC districts may have "c" appearing after their label indicating carports are permitted. A number following the NC designation (NC-6 for example) shall indicate a neighborhood having specific lot size standards limited to the particular neighborhood. While these districts normally apply to generally built-up areas, a zoning change to these districts may be requested for vacant land. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.20.213 - Residential (R) district. 
    The residential (R) district provides for all types of residential uses. This district permits housing types to be mixed within individual blocks. This district is protected from the intrusion of nonresidential uses. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.20.214 - Mixed development (MD) district. 
    The mixed development (MD) district is a mixed-use district permitting a full range of commercial and service uses as well as some lighter or small-scale industrial uses. Residential uses are permitted in this district. This district addresses both new development and areas largely developed with only a few lots or parcels remaining to be developed. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.20.215 - Urban development (UD) district. 
    The urban development (UD) district preserves the urban character of Clovis's central business area. The area is largely developed. Buildings are built to the sidewalk line, having a very different character from the mixed development (MD) district. The primary differences between the MD and UD districts are the intensity, use heights and setbacks. This district permits a full range of uses. While primarily intended for the central business area, if a new area were to develop as a mixed-use area (with both residential and commercial uses) that would serve as a new focal area for the city, rezoning to this category could be permitted. Such rezoning is consistent with this district's purpose, provided the new development is a true mixed-use development-at least thirty percent of the area and a minimum of thirty acres is residential. In this manner, the mixed use creates a true urban neighborhood. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.20.216 - Industrial (I) district. 
    The industrial (I) district is almost exclusively for industrial uses. Some limited commercial uses exhibiting industrial characteristics or located on a major arterial are permitted. Also, the area permits home businesses that involve high intensity activities inconsistent with either the MD district or any residential districts. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.20.217 - Planned redevelopment overlay (PRO) district. 
    The planned redevelopment overlay (PRO) district is a district to be overlaid on any other district. District uses are all conditional, subject to submitting a redevelopment plan; the plan, uses and standards are all approved together. See Sections 17.100.230-17.100.235. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.20.218 - Purpose and intent. 
    In order that the public health, safety, integrity and general welfare may be furthered in an era of increasing urbanization and of growing demand for housing of all types and design, the purpose of this article is to: 
A.  Create a zoning district which encourages flexibility, innovation and variety in the development of land in order to promote its most appropriate, economical and efficient use; 
B.  Improve the design, character and quality of new development which would not be possible under the strict application of other sections of this chapter utilizing performance standards as design criteria; 
C.  Facilitate the adequate and economical provision of streets, utilities and public services; 
D.  Promote more complete neighborhood-scale planning and achieve beneficial land use relationships with the surrounding area; 
E.  Preserve the natural vegetation, topographic, geologic, and scenic features of the landscape; and 
F.  Promote the provision and permanent preservation of common open space and recreation areas and facilities. 
(Ord. No. 1941-2010, § 2, 10-21-10). 
Chapter 17.30 - USE REGULATIONS 

17.30.000 - Purpose. 
    This chapter regulates the land uses in each zoning district. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.30.100 - Use regulations. 
    All land uses or structures shall be permitted in districts only as indicated in this chapter. The following symbols are used in Table 17.30.110. Also, see Sections 17.50.100-17.50.111 which limit location by street access. 
A.  "Y" indicates a permitted use. The use is permitted as a matter of right subject to all performance standards. 
B.  "N" indicates a prohibited use. 
C.  "L" indicates a use permitted subject to limited review. The limited review determines whether the locational, design, or other criteria of Sections 17.50.200-17.50.226 have been met for the proposed site. Not all properties may meet these requirements, thereby limiting the sites upon which the use may be built. 
D.  "C" indicates a use permitted only if a conditional use is approved per Section 17.100.220. 
E.  "D" indicates a use is permitted only in districts followed by "m" or "mp" (see Section 17.30.210). 
(Ord. 1524-97 § 2(part), 1997; Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.30.110 - General use table. 
    Table 17.30.110 lists the type of permission, parking and loading requirements, and limited and conditional use standards, according to general uses in each district. Section 17.50.210 defines the different categories for limited and conditional use standards in Table 17.30.110. Should a use not be identified in Table 17.30.110 or Chapter 17.150, refer to Section 17.100.330 for interpretations.

17.30.200 - Neighborhood conservation (NC) district uses. 
    Neighborhood conservation (NC) districts, while residential in nature, are intended to preserve the existing character of the district. Some use standards or actions are permitted and desirable in these districts, which are not the case in other neighborhood conservation districts. Sections 17.30.200-17.30.211 set forth these standards. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.30.210 - Residential uses. 
    The zoning map contains letters after an NC district designation. NC districts with "c" appearing after the label on the zoning map permit carports in accordance with Section 17.50.111. NC districts with "m" appearing after the label on the zoning map permit mobile homes. NC districts with "mp" appearing after the label on the zoning map permit mobile home parks. NC district with "l" appearing after the label on the zoning map permit livestock in accordance with Section 17.50.211. 
(Ord. 1600-99 § 2(B), 1999: Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.30.211 - Nonresidential uses. 
    In neighborhood conservation (NC) districts, commercial uses may exist. While the input received from the community in drawing the district boundaries indicated no desire to have additional commercial uses, no serious concern with eliminating the nonconforming uses arose. The intent of this title is to encourage those landowners with nonconforming uses to use Sections 17.80.300-17.80.321 to convert their use to a conforming conditional use. Therefore, all existing nonconforming uses created by the designation of an NC district should be considered eligible for conditional use status in the district, even though no designation in Table 17.30.110 is shown. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.30.300 - Planned redevelopment overlay (PRO) district uses. 
    The PRO is a planned district in which the applicant must submit a site plan similar to a preliminary plat as required by the subdivision regulations of the city. In addition, the developer shall specify the uses that will actually be permitted in the proposed development. Once the plan is approved, those uses shall be considered permitted as part of the conditional use process; all other uses not specifically cited in the approval of the PRO district shall remain as shown in Table 17.30.110. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.30.310A - Established. 
    A planned unit development district is established and may be requested on any property within the city. There is no minimum size requirement for property to be considered for a planned unit development district, except as set forth in the table in Section 17.30.310B(B)(1). However, no planned unit development shall be approved where the size of the property is such that the purposes of this article cannot be achieved. 
(Ord. No. 1941-2010, § 2, 10-21-10). 
17.30.310B - Design standards. 
A.  Permitted Uses. Any use or mixture of uses may be proposed under a planned unit development. 
B.  Area, Height and Setbacks. 
1.  The maximum allowable density in any planned unit development shall be determined by the underlying zoning district as follows: 
PUD STANDARDS Zoning 
District Minimum Site 
Area Units/Acre 
Density OSR Ranchette (RA) 10 acres 1.0 70% Single-Family (RS) No minimum 4.50 25% Residential (R) No minimum 15.0 15% Mixed Development (MD) 2.0 acres 16.0 10% Urban Development (UD) 15,000 ft. 2 28.0 10% MAXIMUM DENSITY EXCEEDED ONLY IF PARKING AND OTHER CRITERIA ARE MET.  
2.  If a planned unit development containing residential uses is proposed in a nonresidential district, the maximum allowable density shall be based on the gross acreage devoted to residential use and shall not include area devoted to nonresidential use. 
C.  Parking. Off-street parking or equivalent community parking lots shall be provided at a standard of two spaces per dwelling unit, subject to adjustment recommended by the planning and zoning commission, and approved by the city commission on the basis of projected need, but not less than 1.5 spaces per dwelling unit. Off-street parking for commercial uses shall be provided on the basis of projected need. Current standards in this chapter for commercial uses shall be used as a guide. In residential developments, adequate provisions shall be made for the parking of recreational vehicles. 
D.  Open Space. Compliance with the recreation space dedication requirements of Table 17.30.310B shall be required for all planned unit developments. If the planned unit development includes individually owned units, any common open space shall be maintained in common ownership, established in an appropriate legal manner. Such open space shall be maintained in one of the following methods: 
1.  By the developer or management authority of the planned unit development; 
2.  By a homeowners' association; or 
3.  By the city upon approval of the dedication by the city as public open space. The open space provided shall not reduce the recreation space dedication requirement unless such open space is dedicated to and accepted by the city and is consistent with the parks master plan element. The planned unit development may include areas that are undisturbed if such treatment is judged to be in the best interest of the city. 
E.  Streets and Sidewalks. Streets shall be designed to accommodate projected traffic and parking demands of the development and shall be consistent with sound engineering practices. In no case shall the required right-of-way or street section be reduced on streets shown on the major thoroughfare plan or on streets that serve other property outside of the planned unit development. Sidewalks will be required to serve to connect areas of high pedestrian use. 
F.  Other Conditions. The planning and zoning commission and city commission, in considering the proposed planned unit development, shall specifically consider the compatibility of the individual elements which make up the development plan. In reviewing a planned unit development, the planning and zoning commission may recommend and the city commission require setbacks or other standards of design in excess of or in lieu of those standards normally applicable in any area when, in its opinion, conflicts may result due to possible friction between various types of land uses. 
G.  Design Incentives. 
1.  To further certain goals and objectives that the city has determined should be promoted, the following design incentives may be requested by the petitioners at the time a planned unit development is submitted for consideration: 
a.  For developing property using the planned unit development requirements and promoting the objectives stated in Section 17.20.218, maximum allowable densities may be increased up to ten percent. 
b.  For the preservation of natural features such as floodways and flood channels with natural vegetation, maximum allowable densities may be increased up to fifteen percent. 
c.  For the use of landscaping or screening materials to serve as a buffer between different land uses, maximum allowable densities may increase up to ten percent. 
d.  For the preservation of the floodway or floodplain, maximum allowable densities may be increased up to ten percent. 
2.  If the planning and zoning commission or city commission finds that any of the following conditions would be created by an increase in the maximum allowable density permitted by this section, it may prohibit the increase or limit the increase by an amount which is sufficient to avoid the creation of any of the following conditions: 
a.  Inconvenient or unsafe access to the planned development; 
b.  Traffic congestion in the streets which adjoin the planned development; 
c.  An excessive burden on public parks, recreational areas, schools, and other public facilities which serve or are proposed to serve the planned development; and 
d.  A development which will be incompatible to the intent of Section 17.20.218. 
3.  At the perimeter of the planned unit development, buildings shall be designed to be compatible with adjacent buildings outside the boundary of the development, in terms of such things as heights, land use and building separations. Setbacks of the zones which the development borders shall be used as a guide. 
4.  All other setbacks may be reduced or waived, provided the proposed design is in compliance with all applicable building and fire codes adopted by the city. Setbacks of the underlying zone shall be used as a guide. 
(Ord. No. 1941-2010, § 2, 10-21-10). 
17.30.310C - Modification. 
A.  Minor changes in the location, sizing, height and siting of buildings and structures in a planned unit development may be authorized by the planning and development director without additional public hearings, if required by engineering or other circumstances not foreseen at the time the final plan was approved. The planning and development director shall not approve any of the following changes: 
1.  A change in the use or character of the development. 
2.  A change which would create problems of traffic circulation and public utilities. 
3.  A reduction by greater than three percent of the approved open space. 
4.  A reduction by greater than one percent of the off-street parking and loading space. 
5.  A reduction in the approved pavement widths or rights-of-way for streets or easements. 
6.  An increase of greater than two percent in the approved gross leasable floor areas of commercial buildings in either residential or commercial planned unit developments. 
7.  An increase by greater than one percent in the approved residential density of the proposed development. 
B.  All other changes in use or rearrangement of lots, blocks and building tracts or any changes other than listed in subsection (a) of this section may be made only by the city commission after review and recommendation by the planning and zoning commission. Such amendments shall be made only if they are shown to be required by changes in conditions that have occurred since the final plan was approved or by changes in community policy. Any changes approved in the final plan shall be recorded as amendments to the final plan in accordance with the procedures established for the filing of the initial approved plan documents. 
(Ord. No. 1941-2010, § 2, 10-21-10). 
17.30.320 - Time limits. 
A.  To ensure orderly development of a mixed use planned unit development and the installation of public improvements, a development schedule shall be submitted with the PUD and enforced by the city commission, as provided in this section. 
B.  The applicant must begin and substantially complete the development of an approved planned unit development within two years from the time of final approval. Extensions for successive periods of six months may be granted by the city commission. If the planned unit development is to be developed in stages, the approved plan shall contain a development schedule, and the applicant must begin and substantially complete the development of each stage within two years of the time provided for the start of construction of each stage in the development schedule. Extension may be granted by the city commission on the same basis as for nonstaged development. Failure to develop within the time limit set forth in this subsection shall cause a forfeiture of the right to proceed under the final plan and shall require resubmission of all materials and reapproval of such, unless an extension is granted by the city commission. 
C.  If no development of the planned unit development has commenced, a planned unit development may be abandoned and the property may be developed in conformance with the standards of the zoning district which existed prior to consideration of the planned unit development district. To abandon the planned unit development district, the owner of the property shall file a statement, pursuant to NMSA 1978, Section 3-20-12, with the building safety department, declaring the plat vacated. The vacation of the planned unit development final plat must be endorsed "approved" by the city commission. Upon doing so, the endorsed statement will be filed with the county clerk, and the PUD district designation will be removed from the official map. 
(Ord. No. 1941-2010, § 2, 10-21-10). 
17.30.330 - Guarantees and covenants. 
A.  Open Space Maintenance Guarantee. The city commission may require an open space maintenance guarantee in the form of a written agreement to ensure that the open spaces, recreation areas, communally owned facilities and private streets of the planned unit development are maintained in a reasonable order and condition and in accordance with the approved site plan. 
1.  The agreement shall be submitted to the city attorney and shall not be accepted until approved by him as to legal form and effect. The agreement shall be submitted to the city commission for its approval and shall be placed of record with the county clerk prior to or concurrent with the recording of the final plat. The agreement shall specifically state what procedures would be followed if the common facilities are not maintained in a reasonable condition and what remedies would be available to the city, including but not limited to the maintenance of such facilities by the city and the right of the city to make assessments against the properties in the development on the same basis that the organization responsible for maintenance of the facilities could make such assessments. The cost of maintenance shall be a lien against the common facilities of the planned unit development and the private properties within the development. Any unpaid assessment shall be a lien against the property responsible for such, enforceable the same as a mortgage against such property. 
2.  If the common open space is deeded to a homeowners' association, the applicant shall file the proposed documents governing the association. Such documents shall meet the following requirements: 
a.  The homeowners' association must be established before any residences are sold. 
b.  Membership in the association must be mandatory for each residence owner. 
c.  Open space restrictions must be permanent and not for a period of years. 
d.  The homeowners' association must be made responsible for liability insurance, taxes and maintenance of recreational and other facilities. 
e.  The association must have the power to levy assessments which can become a lien on individual premises for the purpose of paying the cost of operating and maintaining common facilities. 
f.  The governing board of any such association shall consist of at least five members who shall be owners of property in the planned unit development. 
B.  Performance Guarantees. The city commission will require that the applicant (owner) enter into an infrastructure improvement agreement consistent with Section 18.60.300 in an amount equal to the estimated costs of construction and installation of all required landscaping; parking and street improvements, including paving, curbs, sidewalks; water and sewer lines; parks; playgrounds; recreation facilities; and other amenities shown on the final development plan. Such applicant shall file a schedule of anticipated completion dates for such improvements and the performance guarantee with the city clerk, after approval by the city attorney and city engineer. If the improvements are not completed in reasonable conformance with such schedule, the city may undertake to complete the improvements and pay for such improvements from the bond.

Chapter 17.50 - STANDARDS FOR INDIVIDUAL USES 

17.50.000 - Purpose. 
    This chapter provides additional standards that apply to certain individual uses and all limited and conditional uses. The standards may apply to the use in all districts or may be specific for selected districts. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.50.100 - Individual use standards. 
    Sections 17.50.100-17.50.111 contain standards that apply to uses in all districts. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.50.110 - Accessory uses, residential. 
    Residential uses may have accessory buildings provided they conform to the following standards: 
A.  General. Unless specified in subsections B and C of this section, all accessory structures, except carports (see Section 17.50.111) shall meet the following requirements: 
1.  No freestanding accessory structures shall be permitted within the front yard setback or sixty feet from the front yard property line. 
2.  Freestanding structures within the rear yard must maintain the one-foot side yard setback requirement. An accessory building may be located on the rear lot line. The wall facing the side lot line shall not exceed ten feet in height (including roof), except that the height may exceed this height limitation one foot in height for each one foot the accessory building is located inside the side and rear property line. All stormwater shall be retained on lot. 
3.  An accessory building may be located on the rear lot line. The wall facing the side lot line shall not exceed ten feet in height (including roof), except that the height may exceed this height limitation one foot in height for each one foot the accessory building is located inside the side and rear property line. All stormwater shall be retained on lot. 
4.  On a corner lot, an accessory building shall comply with the same side yard setback on the side street as the principal building. 
5.  The total size of all accessory buildings on a residential lot shall not occupy more than fifty percent of the rear yard. 
6.  Accessory buildings may not be constructed of, or incorporate, either modified or freestanding, shipping containers, boxcars, truck beds, or other containers originally designed or constructed for transporting materials and not as a freestanding building or structure. 
B.  Private Stables. Stables are permitted on lots over two acres in area, in equestrian subdivisions, and on lots of record existing as of this title's adoption date which legally had stables located on them. All stables shall conform to the following: 
1.  The stable shall be for the owner's private use only. No horses owned by others shall be permitted to be boarded. Such a use would become a commercial stable. Commercial stables are not permitted. 
2.  Stables shall not exceed forty percent of the total floor area of the house to which they are accessory. 
3.  Stables shall be set back twenty-five feet from property lines. 
4.  No more than one-half animal units shall be permitted per acre on lots. 
C.  Fences. Fences, except for walls on patio and atrium units covered by Table 17.40.110(B), may be permitted to enclose rear yards subject to the following: 
1.  Fences along streets shall be permitted only if specified in the landscaping plan. The fence design shall ensure a uniform appearance. Fences' maximum height shall not exceed eight feet. 
2.  All other fences shall not exceed eight feet in height. 
3.  Front yard fences shall be permitted provided they do not extend into the public right-of-way. No front yard fence shall be permitted to exceed four feet in height and shall be designed to meet the sight distance standards found in the subdivision regulations for the city. 
D.  Walls. Walls of brick, stone, block or other masonry construction may be permitted to exceed the standards of subsection C of this section in the following circumstances: 
1.  Where a subdivision abuts an arterial or collector street, a wall of uniform design along the sub-division's or development's entire frontage may be built to a height of eight feet. 
2.  Where a residential use in the RA, RS, NC or R district abuts a developed area in an MD, UD or I district developed prior to this title's adoption and the residential use has not provided a buffer as required by this title, the landowner may build a wall to screen the use. Such walls shall not exceed ten feet in height. 
3.  Front yard fence height restrictions of fences and walls shall not apply to tracts of two acres or more in an RA (Ranchette) district if there is no sight distance impairment. 
(Ord. 1818-2005 §2, 2005: Ord. 1785-2004 §2, 2004: Ord. 1746-2003 §2(B), 2003; Ord. 1739-2003 §2, 2003; Ord. 1524-97 §2(part), 1997; Ord. 1495-96 §3(part), 1996). 
17.50.111 - Carports. 
    Where "c" follows the lot size designation in an NC district on the zoning map, the lot sizes and changes in the district have resulted in a need for carports. Carports are permitted in front yards only where the "c" designation appears. 
A.  The following standards govern the construction of all carports in front yards in both the NC-c and NCc-1 districts: 
1.  No carport in the front yard shall exceed twenty-six feet wide by twenty feet deep. 
2.  In no case shall the installation of a carport create any right-of-way obstruction by the vehicle parked in the carport nor shall the carport be located closer than one foot to the property line. 
3.  The clear site triangle shall start twelve feet back from the inside of the curb line. 
4.  Clear views from the carport are required for safety. No obstructions to view shall be located between three and one-half and six and one-half feet above grade along the carport's exterior. No obstructions to view shall be located within a thirty-degree sight triangle located on either side of the carport. 
5.  Carports shall not be used for storing items other than personal or company vehicles, motorcycles or bicycles. 
B.  For those areas where the "NC-c" designation appears, the roof of the carport shall be similar to the roof of the house. Roofs shall be similar in color and pitch to that of the dwelling. Where the roof is pitched, the gutter shall be at the same level as those on the house. Carport ceilings shall be between six and one-half and nine feet above the floor of the carport. The carport's supporting structure shall also match the principal structure on the lot. 
C.  For those areas where the "NCc-1" designation appears, premanufactured, flat top, and other carport construction that does not meet the requirements of the NC-c construction requirements shall be allowed so long as the following conditions are met: 
1.  All premanufactured carports and any carports utilizing structural steel members or steel pipe shall require design approval by a professional engineer to standards adopted by the New Mexico Construction Industries Division.

Chapter 17.80 - NONCONFORMITIES 
ARTICLE I - PURPOSE 

17.80.000 - Purpose. 
    This chapter regulates nonconforming uses, buildings or structures, lots and signs. This chapter classifies nonconformities by the degree of conflict, annoyance, incompatibility or hazard to the surrounding community. The regulations' purpose is to eliminate nuisances and nonconformities which are highly incompatible with neighboring uses. Where the incompatibility is minor, the purpose is to mitigate and set standards for the property's continued use. All nonconforming uses, buildings or structures, lots and signs shall be encouraged to be converted to conforming uses. Rules and procedures are established to balance the desire to eliminate the use against the degree of the problem and the landowner's rights.

(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.80.110 - Classification of nonconforming buildings. 
    Buildings and structures are nonconforming if they fail to meet this title's floor area, density, setback, bufferyard, height, parking or bulk requirements. Nonconforming buildings are further defined as major and minor according to the following: 
A.  Minor nonconforming buildings are all those buildings that exceed the setback, bufferyard or bulk standards. 
B.  Major nonconforming buildings exceed this title's floor area, density or parking standards. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996).

(Ord. 1524-97 § 2(part), 1997; Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.80.130 - Classification of nonconforming signs. 
    All nonconforming signs shall be classed as major nonconformities. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
ARTICLE III - STANDARDS FOR NONCONFORMITIES 

17.80.210 - Expanding minor nonconforming uses. 
    Rules for expanding a minor nonconforming use are: 
A.  The use cannot be expanded unless adequate on-site parking is available for the expansion. 
B.  The expansion shall be no more than twenty percent of the floor area, provided the expansion can be done within the setback lines. No expansion shall be permitted if the use is also a nonconforming structure. 
C.  Any elements of the use identified as a nuisance to adjoining properties shall be mitigated through additional buffering, landscaping, or relocation of doors, waste storage, or other problems with the use. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.80.211 - Expanding minor nonconforming structures. 
    Rules for expanding a minor nonconforming structure or building are: 
A.  The expansion shall be no more than twenty percent of the floor area, provided the expansion can be done within the setback lines. No expansion shall be permitted if the use is also a nonconforming use. 
B.  Any elements of the use identified as a nuisance to adjoining properties shall be mitigated through additional buffering, landscaping, or relocation of doors, waste storage, or other problems with the use. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.80.212 - Nonconforming lots. 
    Major nonconforming lots shall not be built upon. Minor nonconforming lots may be built upon. The following rules apply to nonconforming lots: 
A.  Where any nonconforming lot is held in common ownership with adjoining lot(s), it shall be combined to make one or more conforming lots. 
B.  When any nonconforming lot is sold to an adjoining landowner, the lot must be combined with the adjoining lot to create a conforming lot. 
C.  All lots shall have either approved connections to public sewer or acquire a permit for an on-site system. 
D.  Lot development must meet all performance standards of this title, or the standards of the lot specified in Section 17.80.120. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.80.220 - Conversion to a lesser use. 
A.  Uses may convert to a lesser intensity use upon receiving a conditional use permit or certification from the zoning officer that the new use is a lesser intensity, whichever is applicable. 
B.  No enlargement of the use shall be permitted with the conversion, except as it qualifies under Sections 17.80.211-17.80.212. Provided the enlargement meets all this section's requirements, an enlargement is considered desirable if it promotes a neighborhood or community improvement. 
C.  The following rules shall apply to determining whether a conversion promotes an improvement. At least three (including the one standard required) of the six following standards shall be met: 
1.  Required. The first priority for land resulting from reductions in parking, loading area or exterior storage shall be to meet the maximum feasible landscaping provisions set forth by this title for the district in which the proposed conversion is located. 
2.  The use's total amount of required parking shall be reduced as a result of the conversion. 
3.  The use's total amount of peak hour and average daily traffic generated shall be reduced as a result of the conversion. 
4.  Where noise generated on the nonconforming use's site is audible off site, the conversion shall reduce the noise level at least fifty percent. 
5.  If exterior storage is involved, the conversion shall eliminate it. 
6.  As a result of the conversion, truck traffic shall be reduced or eliminated. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.80.230 - Damage repair. 
    Damage repair of nonconforming uses is permitted. The following rules shall be used: 
A.  No repairs exceeding fifty percent of the use's value shall be permitted. 
B.  Should a major nonconforming building's structural integrity be damaged, thereby making the structure unsafe, the use shall be terminated. 
C.  All values shall be based on the construction costs of the repairs compared with replacing the entire structure. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.80.240 - Termination by abandonment. 
A.  All nonconforming uses shall be deemed terminated if abandoned. Rules to determine abandonment are: 
1.  Any nonconforming use, structure or sign, the use of which is discontinued for a consecutive period of time as specified in this section, regardless of any intent to resume or not to abandon such use, is considered abandoned. The nonconformity cannot be reestablished except in full compliance with this title. 
2.  Any period of discontinuance caused by government actions, strikes or material shortages and without any contributing fault by the nonconforming user, shall not be considered in calculating the length of discontinuance. 
3.  If the abandonment is due to the use's partial destruction, it is subject to the requirements of this section. If the nonconformity may legally be rebuilt, it shall not be considered abandoned if this section's requirements are met. 
B.  Abandonment shall require the use, lot or structure to be abandoned for a period of one hundred eighty days. For signs, the abandonment period is sixty days. 
C.  Any nonconforming sign relating to a business on the premises on which it is located shall be terminated upon any change in the text of said sign or issuing a zoning permit for a change in use. 
D.  Any partially destroyed nonconforming use, sign or structure shall be considered abandoned if action is not initiated to have it inspected to determine if it can be rebuilt within thirty working days of the destruction date. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
ARTICLE IV - PROCEDURE FOR MITIGATING A NONCONFORMITY 

17.80.301 - Purpose. 
    Many nonconformities have been in neighborhoods for a long time. Some may have only recently become nonconforming. In many instances, the use is an integral part of the neighborhood's function. Zoning's purpose is to protect neighborhoods. Therefore, if the community is comfortable with the particular use or structure, the term "nonconformity" may not be what the community desires. Under such conditions, the use may be mitigated and made conforming to remove the stigma typically associated with the obtainment of loans for a nonconforming use. Sections 17.80.301-17.80.321 provide the procedures for making a nonconformity conform. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.80.310 - Procedure. 
    Any major or minor nonconforming use, building or structure, lot or sign may apply for a conditional use permit for the use, building or structure, lot or sign. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.80.320 - Criteria for approval. 
    In addition to the criteria for a conditional use approval set forth in Chapter 17.100, the applicant shall meet the following requirements: 
A.  Demonstrate that the use has minimal incompatibilities that have been integrated into the neighborhood's function. Factors to evaluate this criteria include: 
1.  That the neighborhood residents patronize or are employed at the use (for nonresidential uses); 
2.  That management practices eliminate problems such as noise, waste materials, competition for on-street parking, or similar conflicts; 
3.  That the use has no history of complaints (with police or fire calls) against it; 
4.  That the use has been maintained in good condition, or that the nonconformity represents a disincentive for such maintenance. 
B.  The planning department staff shall review the application and recommend in writing any conditions relative to the expansion of bufferyards, landscaping or other site design. The review may also contain use limitations believed necessary to address any concerns that as a conforming use it might become a nuisance. 
C.  The planning department staff shall submit a list of all the property's nonconforming conditions. 
D.  The planning and zoning commission shall first determine that the use is generally integrated into the neighborhood and has minimal adverse impacts. Upon that finding, the commission may attach conditions as it deems necessary to ensure that the use remains a good neighbor. 
E.  Sign mitigation shall not be permitted in any circumstance. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.80.321 - Effect. 
    Upon granting a conditional use permit, the planning department staff shall have a notation placed on the zoning map stating the property is a conditional use. Granting the conditional use makes the use, structure or building, lot or sign conform to the specifics of the conditional approval, eliminating the nonconformance. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996).

ARTICLE III - STANDARDS FOR APPROVAL 

17.100.210 - Amendments to the text or zoning map. 
    This section provides a method for changing the boundaries of the zoning map or the text of this title. It is not intended to relieve particular hardships, or to confer special privileges or rights on any person, but only to make necessary adjustments in light of changed conditions. In determining whether to grant a requested amendment, the city shall consider the factors set forth in this section and the consistency of the proposed amendment with the intent of the comprehensive plan. 
A.  Initiation. 
1.  Amendment to Zoning Map. In addition to the landowner, an application for an amendment to the zoning map may be proposed by the city commission, planning and zoning commission or planning department staff. 
2.  Amendment to Text of Title. An application for an amendment to the text of this title may be proposed by the city commission, the planning department staff, the landowner or any citizen of the city. 
B.  General Standards. There shall be findings that amendments to the text of this title or a general amendment to the zoning map shall be consistent with the purpose and provisions of this title and the comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.211 - Standards for zoning map amendment. 
    Amendments to the zoning map shall be approved only if there are findings that they meet at least one of the following standards: 
A.  Amendments that are consistent with the comprehensive plan shall be approved unless there is compelling evidence that there would be a threat to the public health, safety and welfare which is unique to the proposed amendment because the location of the property is substantially different from other areas so designated in the comprehensive plan. 
B.  Amendments that are inconsistent with the comprehensive plan shall be approved only if the applicant demonstrates that the existing zoning is inappropriate because: 
1.  An error or mistake was made when the existing zoning map pattern was created; or 
2.  The conditions of the neighborhood or community have substantially changed to justify the change. 
C.  An amendment to the zoning map shall not be approved where some of the permissive uses in the proposed district would be harmful to adjacent property, the neighborhood or community. 
D.  The cost of land or other economic considerations pertaining to the applicant shall not be the determining factor. 
E.  A zoning change request which would designate one small area different from the surrounding area, especially when only one premises is involved, is generally called a spot zone. Such a request may be approved only when: 
1.  The change will clearly facilitate implementation of the comprehensive plan; or 
2.  The area of the proposed change is different from surrounding land because it could function as a transition between adjacent districts, or because the site is not suitable for the uses allowed in any adjacent districts due to topography, traffic, or special adverse land uses nearby, or because the nature of structures already on the premises makes the site unsuitable for the uses allowed in any adjacent district. 
(Ord. 1524-97 § 2(part), 1997; Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.212 - Standards for title text amendment. 
    An amendment to the text of this title shall be approved if: 
A.  It would implement a portion of the comprehensive plan that is new; 
B.  It would implement and better achieve the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan that have proved difficult to achieve under the existing provisions of this title; 
C.  The provisions of this title were inconsistent or unreasonable in light of standards for similar uses; 
D.  It is necessary in order to respond to state and/or federal legislation; 
E.  It provides additional flexibility in meeting the objectives of this title without lowering the general standards of this title. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.220 - Conditional uses. 
    Approval of an application for a conditional use shall be dependent upon findings that the proposed use fully complies with all the standards of this title. The application shall be filed and duly advertised and a public hearing held per the requirements of this chapter. In addition, a conditional use shall require approval of a site plan or a plat, as appropriate, which may be approved separately or concurrently. The following additional standards shall also be met: 
A.  The proposed use shall be consistent with the purposes, goals, objectives and policies of the comprehensive plan, including standards for building and structural intensities and densities, and intensities of use. 
B.  The proposed use shall be compatible with the character of the immediate vicinity of the land proposed for development. 
C.  The design of the proposed use shall minimize adverse effects, including visual impact of the proposed use on adjacent lands. 
D.  The proposed use shall minimize adverse impacts on the environment, traffic and congestion, infrastructure or governmental services. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.221 - Conditions and restrictions. 
    The decision-making body may impose reasonable restrictions and conditions on the approval of conditional use permits. All conditions and restrictions shall be put in writing and given to the developer within two days after the approval. The approval and all conditions are to be agreed to by the developer in writing within ten days. If there is no agreement, the application shall be considered denied. This may be done to accomplish any of the following: 
A.  Ensure the conditional use is developed exactly as presented in drawings, exhibits and assertions made at the hearings; 
B.  Limit uses, reduce density, increase open space, landscaped surfaces or environmental protection to insure it meets the standards by which it is approved; 
C.  Impose conditions that ensure the general purposes, goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan and this title are met; 
D.  Prevent or minimize adverse effects from the proposed use and development on other properties in the neighborhood and on the general health, safety and welfare. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.222 - Minor deviations. 
    The planning department staff may authorize minor deviations from conditional use permits that appear necessary in light of technical or engineering considerations first discovered during actual development and that are not reasonably anticipated during the initial approval process, as long as they comply with the standards of this title. Minor deviations shall not include increases in the intensity of use, the introduction of uses not previously approved, or decreases in the amount of open space or resource protection. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.223 - Amendment to a conditional use permit. 
    A conditional use permit may be amended, extended, varied or altered only pursuant to the standards and procedures for the approval of the original use set forth in this chapter. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.230 - Planned redevelopment overlay (PRO) district. 
    This section sets forth procedures and requirements for approving a planned redevelopment overlay (PRO) district. This overlay district is a planned development in which the approval is based on a preliminary site plan. The approval shall be treated as a conditional use approval subject to the requirements and standards of Sections 17.100.220-17.100.223. If public funds or eminent domain are to be used, the city shall comply with State Statute 3-60A-1 NMSA. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996).

    The plan shall meet the following standards: 
A.  The plan shall meet all requirements for a preliminary plan or plat in accordance with the subdivision regulations for the city. 
B.  A building conditions survey shall indicate all district building and property conditions. City inspectors shall have the right of access to confirm the survey data. 
C.  The preliminary plat shall indicate redevelopment areas, where buildings will be demolished and new building(s) added, and conservation areas where buildings will be rehabilitated or remain as-is, except for upgrading to comply with the city codes. 
D.  The preliminary plat shall indicate any proposed plat vacations accomplished by combining lots, streets or alleys. 
E.  The applicant shall submit a detailed description of the intended redevelopment actions and their timing and financing, including a permitted use table identifying on the plan where specific uses shall be permitted. Landscaping, sign control, street, or other public improvements shall be listed. Any proposed improvements to be performed by the city shall be identified. The proposed bonuses shall be indicated. 
F.  The applicant shall provide a specific list of any requested changes in standards from those in the underlying district, including permitted uses, lot, or other standards. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.233 - Standards. 
    The PRO district shall meet the following minimum standards: 
A.  The conditional approval requirements of Section 17.100.220; 
B.  A specific finding shall indicate the area is or has deteriorated, and that approving a PRO district will encourage reinvestment in the district and surrounding area; 
C.  The city shall determine if the applicants have the economic ability to perform the redevelopment. If multiple landowners operate separately, the city shall evaluate the applicant's ability to ensure all parties meet the desired goals and determine feasibility. Sunset and phasing conditions may be imposed to ensure the proposed action occurs within the proposed time frame. 
D.  As conditions warrant, the city shall take all vacation and funding actions essential to implementing the redevelopment plan. Failing to approve these conditions shall render the approval void. If a decision for approval must await a new budget cycle, the city shall have the right to hold the final approval until such a determination can be made. 
E.  All density bonus calculations shall be based on the original area of the PRO district, not including any land gained by vacations to be made by the city. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.234 - Approvals. 
    Approval is a two-step process. Each step must go through the hearing process. A preliminary approval is based on a preliminary plan. Final approval requires submitting and approval of a final plat. Final plat approval shall be granted if the plat: 
A.  Generally conforms to the preliminary plat; 
B.  All engineering is acceptable to the city; 
C.  All required financing or other surety required for public or community improvements are acceptable to the city; 
D.  The approval is limited to the specific plan. Should that plan not be built, the controlling standards remain that of the underlying zoning district. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.235 - Mapping. 
    Upon receiving preliminary approval, the zoning map shall be amended to indicate the boundary of the PRO district. The letters PRO, the word "pending," and the date of approval shall be placed on the zoning map. The underlying districts letters shall also appear within the boundary. Upon receiving final approval, the word "pending" shall be removed and the district given a file number for future reference. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.240 - Variances. 
    This section sets forth the procedures and conditions for a variance from the standards of this title which permit, under limited circumstances, a building or structure to be built that does not comply with all standards in this title. A variance may be appropriate when strict enforcement would represent a unique, undue and unnecessary hardship. Under no conditions shall a variance allow a use that is not otherwise permitted in the district. The applicant shall be instructed to submit a zone change request, which is the only way such a change of use may occur. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.241 - Standards for variances. 
    To approve a variance, the decision-making body shall find that all of the following standards without exception are met based on the evidence presented by staff reports and testimony: 
A.  There are special circumstances or conditions which are peculiar to the land or building for which the variance is sought that do not apply generally to lots, land or buildings in the neighborhood. 
B.  The special circumstances and conditions have not resulted from any act of the applicant subsequent to the adoption of this title. 
C.  The special circumstances and conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of this title would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land or building. 
D.  The granting of the variance is necessary to provide the applicant a reasonable use of the land or building. 
E.  The variance granted is the minimum necessary to make possible the reasonable use of the land or building. 
F.  The granting of the variance will not be injurious to the neighborhood surrounding the land where the variance is proposed and is otherwise not detrimental to the public welfare. 
G.  The granting of the variance is in harmony with the purposes and intent of this title. 
H.  The granting of the variance is consistent with the comprehensive plan. 
I.  Financial hardship to the applicant shall not be the sole basis for the decision. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.242 - Conditions and restrictions on variances. 
    In approving the application for any variance, the decision-making body may impose additional restrictions and conditions on such approval, including limits on the use of the property, the standards for locating the use, standards for mitigating the impact on adjoining property owners who would lose protection as a result of permitting the variance, or standards to protect the general health, safety and welfare. All conditions imposed upon any variance shall be expressly set forth in writing with the granting of such variance. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.243 - Subsequent development approvals. 
    Development approved by the variance shall not be carried out until the applicant has secured all other development approvals required by this title. The approval of a variance shall apply only to that section of the regulations for which it is approved, and does not ensure that the development shall receive subsequent approval unless the relevant and applicable portions of this title or other ordinances are met. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.244 - Amendment to a variance. 
    A variance may be amended, extended, varied or altered only pursuant to the standards and procedures for the original approval of a variance. An application for the same variance on the same site may not be considered within twelve months of the date of final action on the prior application. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
ARTICLE IV - APPEALS AND INTERPRETATIONS 

17.100.300 - Appeals and interpretations. 
    This article contains rules and standards for appealing the decisions made pursuant to this title. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.310 - Appeals. 
    There are two types of appeals, administrative appeals and judicial relief. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.311 - Administrative appeals. 
    Administrative appeals shall be heard based solely on the materials (plans, documents, reports, studies, drawings and testimony) available to the official or body rendering the decision. Appeals shall not consider new or altered plans. However, information submitted, but not discussed or considered in rendering a decision shall be considered part of the original evidence. New evidence shall not be permitted. If the body rendering a decision on the appeal believes that there is insufficient evidence to render a decision, it shall remand the matter back to the person or body that made the original decision, stating specific reasons for remanding the matter and the purpose for conducting the public hearing to obtain additional evidence. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.312 - Persons may appeal. 
    Any party can appeal. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.313 - Requirements for application. 
    Applications for an appeal shall clearly articulate the reasons for the appeal, specifically citing and explaining one or more alleged errors: 
A.  In applying adopted city plans, policies and ordinances in arriving at the decision; 
B.  In the appealed action or decision, including its stated facts; 
C.  In acting arbitrarily or capriciously or being manifestly abusive of discretion. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.314 - Procedures for appeals. 
    In addition to the procedures established in Sections 17.100.152 and 17.100.153, the following additional procedures shall be applicable to public hearings for appeals: 
A.  An untimely appeal shall not be considered, pursuant to Section 17.100.154(C) of this title. 
B.  The planning department staff shall provide written notice of the date, time and place of the public hearing to the applicant, a representative of the opponents, if any are known, and the appellant at least ten working days prior to the hearing. A similar notice shall be mailed to any interested persons who have provided stamped, self-addressed envelopes for such purpose. 
C.  The body hearing the appeal shall hold a hearing on the entire record sent to it and shall not consider new evidence or testimony. The decision on the appeal may be to reverse, affirm or modify the original decision. 
D.  If it appears that some additional evidence is necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, the body hearing the appeal shall remand the matter back to the person or body from which the original decision came with the specific reasons for the remand. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.315 - Administrative appeal standards. 
    The purpose of the appeal is to determine if the original decision met the requirements of this title. The body hearing the appeal is limited to the following determinations: 
A.  The decision maker made an error in reviewing whether a standard was met. The record must indicate that there was an error in judgment, or misreading of facts, plans or regulations in determining whether this standard was met. 
B.  Where conflicting evidence exists, the appeal is limited to determining what evidence or testimony bears the greatest credibility. 
C.  The decision maker made the decision on standards not contained in this or other city ordinances, regulations or state law; or a standard was applied more strictly or broadly than is appropriate to implement the comprehensive plan and this title. This title does not permit administrative decision makers to consider or create standards that are not officially adopted. 
D.  The decision maker made an error in applying a standard or measuring a standard. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.316 - Judicial relief. 
    The final decision on any application may be appealed to the district court, pursuant to Section 3-21-9 NMSA 1978, provided all administrative remedies have been exhausted. Specifically, denials that could be approved via a variance or a beneficial use appeal shall be submitted to the courts only upon the completion of the procedures specified in this title. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.320 - Beneficial use determination. 
A.  The purpose and intent of this title is that every landowner in Clovis should enjoy a beneficial use of their property. A beneficial use determination is a process by which the city evaluates the allegation that there is no beneficial use, and can provide relief from the regulations by granting additional development potential to provide a beneficial use of the property. It is also the intent of this section that such relief not increase the potential for damaging the health, safety or welfare of future users of the property or neighbors that might reasonably be anticipated if the landowner were permitted to build. 
B.  In the event that a landowner in Clovis is of the opinion that all beneficial use of that landowner's property has been denied, or taken by the application of this title, then the procedures of Sections 17.100.320-17.100.323 shall be used prior to seeking relief from the courts in order that any denial of beneficial use of property may be remedied through a nonjudicial forum. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.321 - Special application data. 
    The nature of this appeal requires detailed financial information on the property that is not required or desired in normal applications. The following data shall accompany all applications for a beneficial use appeal: 
A.  Documentation of the date of purchase and the purchase price of the property; 
B.  A description of the physical features present on the property, the property's total acreage, and the present use of the property, and the use of the property at the time of the adoption of this title; 
C.  A description of the specific portions of the regulations which are alleged to result in an elimination of all beneficial use of the property together with all appraisals, studies, any other supporting evidence, and any actions taken by the city related to the property; 
D.  A description of the use which the landowner believes represents the minimum beneficial use of the property and all documentation, studies, and other evidence supporting that position; 
E.  Documentation that the property has been listed for sale for at least six months after the adoption of this title, and originals or copies of all bids, offers-to-purchase, and other correspondence regarding the sale of such property. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.322 - Deprivation standards. 
    In determining if a landowner has been deprived of beneficial use of property, the hearing officer and the city commission shall take into account the following factors: 
A.  Diminution in Value. The value of the property prior to adoption of this title which caused the landowner to apply for relief shall be compared to the value of the property with the regulations as applied. A mere diminution in value does not deprive the landowner of a beneficial use; the diminution must be so drastic that it effectively deprives the landowner of any significant use or enjoyment of the property. 
B.  Common Land Uses. A use common to the city and/or the area of the subject site, although it may not involve further development of the land, is considered a beneficial use. Attention shall also be given to land uses that are considered to be the lowest intensity in the city or adjoining areas but which uses still provide for occupation and living by the landowner. These land uses shall be considered beneficial uses. 
C.  Unique Treatment. Whether or not the property is being singled out for different treatment than similarly situated properties under this title. 
D.  Subsidy. A minimum beneficial use of the land should be one that does not have any governmental subsidy attached to the use or long-term safe occupation of the property. If such a subsidy exists, then it should be reflected in considering minimum beneficial use on a valuation basis. The public costs of a subsidy should be considered as a payment to the landowner for the restriction on the property if there is an annual subsidy that enhances the economic return of the existing use to the landowner. To reflect the degree to which a subsidy enhances the property value, the value of a proposed use shall be adjusted by determining value of the use without the subsidy. 
E.  Adverse Impacts. The extent to which the regulations protect users or neighbors from threats to health or safety shall be fully accounted for. A use that seriously threatens the health of future residents or neighbors is not a beneficial use. 
F.  Expectations. Expectations shall, in general, not be considered. Expectations shall only be considered if they are backed by investments, made prior to the adoption of the restrictions in question, that are substantially above the cost of the land and normal planning investments, shall they be considered. 
G.  Nuisances. In no case shall a use that is a nuisance per se, or a use that in that particular location constitutes a nuisance, be granted as relief. Such uses are not legal uses of the land and thus no taking of beneficial use of the land can occur. The hearing officer shall recommend denial if the proposed use or current use to be discontinued is a nuisance. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.323 - Granting of relief. 
    If the hearing officer finds a landowner has been denied all beneficial use of his property, then he shall recommend that relief be granted. 
A.  Minimum Increase. In granting relief, the landowner shall be given the minimum increase in use intensity or other possible concessions from this title to permit a beneficial use of the land. The highest use, or even an average reasonable expectation, is not required or intended as the appropriate remedy. The following guidelines shall be used for determining the minimum beneficial use of property and, therefore, the amount of relief to be granted a landowner to reach that minimum. 
1.  The standards of Section 17.100.322 shall be used to indicate the need for additional density or uses. 
2.  The limited development potential, given the natural condition of the property, shall not be attributed to the regulations applied to the property. If the property is such that it cannot safely accommodate development with normal grading and clearing practices, this fact shall be taken into account in identifying the best site for development that minimizes costs of development. Any savings to the developer in land modification shall be considered in determining the beneficial use. 
3.  The potential for damages to either residents or property shall be assessed in determining a beneficial use. Conditions shall be placed on sites where damage from building on hazardous conditions is likely. The conditions may include location restrictions, size limitations, construction practices, and shall require a building to be built so it will not be damaged. 
B.  Granting of Relief. The decision of the hearing officer shall be ratified by the city commission at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The ratification shall be by resolution. If the city commission does not ratify a grant of relief recommended by the hearing officer, it shall conduct a public hearing to amend this title in accordance with the standards of Section 17.100.212. Under no conditions shall relief be granted unless there is a finding of no beneficial use. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.330 - Interpretations. 
    An interpretation is required when this title's provisions are not clear or when a use is proposed that is not listed in Tables 17.30.110 and 17.30.111.

17.100.331 - Unlisted uses. 
    Uses not listed in Chapters 17.30 and 17.150 shall be placed into the most similar category. For nonresidential use, the SIC code shall be the first guide. Where an SIC code is found in several categories, the interpretation shall seek similar characteristics, including the intensity of the use and its likely impacts. Where a choice remains after reviewing impacts, the use should be classified with the similar use with the most impacts. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.100.332 - Meaning or application. 
    When evaluating a provision of this title as to its meaning or application, the provisions of Section 17.110.010 on legislative intent shall be applied. Interpretations shall not lessen protection, but may provide greater flexibility in meeting this title's objectives. Determining the public health, safety and welfare purposes of the provision shall guide the decision.

(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.110.010 - Legislative intent. 
    This title is intended to protect the interests of both present and future residents and the general public from adverse impacts of land uses. Each standard is developed as a regulatory response to an identifiable negative impact or potential. At the same time, this title is intended to respect the right of landowners to a beneficial use of their property. These regulations were designed to provide greater flexibility and more development options to protect public rights and to minimize impact on property owners to the greatest extent consistent with good planning principles. A sound interpretation of any standard cannot be ensured without a careful analysis of the end to which the regulation is directed. Administrators and other persons shall interpret this title based on an understanding of the purposes intended. The intent of the standards and supporting definitions is to protect both individual property owners and the general public from adverse impacts which might otherwise be the result of a proposed land use. To this end, those called upon to interpret this title shall proceed as follows: 
A.  Public Purpose. Before any decision is made, there must be an explicit identification of the purposes for which the regulation or standard was initially imposed by the legislative body. This shall include the purposes stated in this title and its relevant chapter(s), article(s) or section(s), and an examination of the comprehensive plan. 
B.  Impact. Two questions must be asked to determine the actual impact of various proposed interpretations: 
1.  Does the interpretation reduce protection to the public or occupants of the site? 
2.  Does the interpretation provide greater freedom to the landowner to use the property? 
C.  Decision Criteria. The decision should permit flexibility in design provided that it shall not lower the protection afforded to the public. An interpretation which permits increased design freedom is to be encouraged. An interpretation which permits any of the following is prohibited: 
1.  A use prohibited in the district or a use similar to a prohibited use; 
2.  An intensity increase in the use beyond the degree specified in this title; 
3.  A decrease in a standard that reduces the protection afforded neighbors, the environment or the general public; 
4.  A decrease in a standard that would endanger users of a property or others. 
D.  Balancing Rights. This title has been carefully designed to avoid regulations that either sacrifice legitimate public goals, including the protection of adjoining property owners, or require undue limitations on the ability of property owners to use their land in manners consistent with the goals of the city comprehensive plan. Great care has been taken to both balance the rights of competing groups and achieve maximum protection with flexibility and a range of use options. Persons interpreting this title shall not substitute their judgments for the legislative intent of the city commission. 
(Ord. 1495-96 § 3(part), 1996). 
17.110.100 - Severability. 
    If any article, section, paragraph, clause, provision or portion of this title is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this title shall not be affected. If any application of this title to a particular structure, land or water is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not be applicable to any other structure, land or water not specifically included in said judgment.

A.  An agreement or contract setting forth the construction plan, method of construction, and parties responsible for the construction of any public improvements, together with adequate security or collateral acceptable to the city, will be required prior to the commencement of construction of any public improvements. In addition thereto, no final subdivision plat will be approved until the applicant has submitted and the city has approved a subdivision improvements agreement, as defined herein guaranteeing construction of the required public improvements shown on the final subdivision plat, together with collateral which is sufficient in the judgment of the city to make reasonable provisions for the completion of the improvements in accordance with the design and time specifications. The developer is prohibited from selling lots within a subdivision (see Section 3-20-14, NMSA 1978) prior to the installation of improvements. No building permit shall be issued within any subdivision until the improvements agreement has been accepted by the city and a form of financial guaranty has been accepted and received by the city. The installation of sidewalks prior to the issuance of a building permit will not be required until the end of the one year warranty period for the public improvements. Before the end of the one year warranty period, all sidewalks within the subdivision must be installed. The types of collateral which may be used as security under this section are as follows:

7.  Liens on the subdivision property in favor of the city. 
B.  The city will not require security agreements with collateral arrangements in excess of the city engineer's estimate of the cost of public improvements. Written bids executed by licensed New Mexico contractors will be accepted as evidence of cost when available. 
C.  Release or Use of Collateral, Security. As public improvements are completed, the applicant may apply to the city for a release of part or all of the collateral or security deposited with the city. Upon final inspection, approval and acceptance of the public improvements by the city engineer, the city will release the collateral or security. If the city determines that any of the improvements are not constructed in substantial compliance with applicable city specifications, the city may, pursuant to the improvements agreement, withdraw and employ from the deposited collateral of security such funds as may be necessary to construct or repair the improvements in accordance with such specifications. 
(Ord. 1819-2005 § 2, 2005: Ord. 1606-99 § 2(part), 1999). 
Chapter 18.70 - DESIGN STANDARDS 

18.70.100 - General. 
    The design standards contained in these regulations, and elsewhere, are intended to implement the Clovis comprehensive plan. Construction standards which apply to the actual construction of a facility or utility are found in the public works department manual "Construction Standards" and New Mexico standard specifications for public works construction. Traffic standards which apply to these regulations are found in the latest edition of the Institute of Traffic Engineers "Transportation and Traffic Engineering Handbook." 
    All improvements must meet all Federal ADA Regulations. 
(Ord. 1606-99 § 2(part), 1999). 
18.70.200 - When applied. 
    Design standards apply to all improvements within a subdivided or planned unit development area. The designer of a subdivision must use the design standards when designing a subdivision. The city must use the design standards when reviewing a subdivision plan or plat, or plans for other public facilities. All projects within the city will conform to the design standards contained in these regulations. 
(Ord. 1606-99 §2(part), 1999). 
18.70.300 - Traffic circulation facilities. 
    The required right-of-way based on expected traffic volume is found in Table 1. The road system must be designed to permit the safe, efficient, and orderly movement of traffic; to meet, but not exceed the needs of the present and future population served; to have a simple and logical pattern; to respect natural features and topography; and to present an attractive streetscape. The arrangement of streets will conform to the circulation plan of the Clovis comprehensive plan or official maps of Clovis. For streets not shown on the comprehensive plan or official maps, the arrangement will provide for the appropriate extension of existing streets. Residential streets will be arranged so as to discourage through traffic and provide for maximum privacy. 
A.  Arterial Street. An arterial street is intended to carry a large volume of traffic from one part of the community to another part. State highways which carry traffic through Clovis are also arterial streets. Arterial streets will be located a maximum of one mile apart, preferably on a section line. If the land use pattern will generate in excess of ten thousand ADT, the arterial street will be located closer than one mile. Any arterial street shown on the Clovis comprehensive plan must be dedicated. 
B.  Collector Street. Residential streets will access to collector streets designed for higher speeds and higher traffic volumes. A collector street will connect with an arterial street and be located midway between arterial streets (approximately one half mile from each parallel arterial street). A collector street will serve each area of a subdivision containing four hundred dwelling units. The collector street will be centrally located to the dwelling units served. Collector streets should interconnect. When intersecting with an arterial street, collector streets must intersect with another collector street or be off-set by at least one thousand feet. Any collector street shown on the Clovis comprehensive plan must be located and dedicated as such. 
C.  Local Street. A local street provides frontage for access to lots and carries traffic that has origin or destination at lots adjacent to the street. Local streets are designed to carry the least amount of traffic at the lowest speed. All, or the maximum number of housing units, must front on this class of street. An east-to-west orientation is considered desirable. A local street may intersect with an arterial street if offset by at least six hundred fifty feet on the same side of the arterial from any other intersection, measured centerline to centerline, with the arterial and generates no more than two hundred fifty ADT. A local street and an arterial street may intersect at a T-intersection only. 
D.  Other Streets. 
    Cul-de-sac. A cul-de-sac is a street with a single means of ingress and egress with a turnaround at the end. Design of turnaround may vary. A cul-de-sac must be designed according to anticipated ADT level; a residential access cul-de-sac will have a maximum ADT level of two hundred fifty. 
    Marginal access street. A marginal access street runs parallel to a collector or arterial street and provides access to abutting properties and separation from through traffic on adjacent streets. 
    Private street. A private street is permitted in PUD. The design of the street must be based upon the expected ADT. An applicant must submit a traffic study justifying any street with a cross-section less than a required public street. 
E.  Alley. A service road that provides secondary means of access to all lots is required unless the city accepts an alternative design plan. 
F.  Intersection. 
1.  Streets will be laid out so as to intersect at right angles, except where topography or other site conditions justify variations. The angle of an intersection must not vary more than ten degrees from a right angle. No intersection of public or private streets will be on a curve of centerline radius less than five hundred feet. No curb cut will be allowed on a curve section of road whose inside curve radius is less than one hundred fifty feet. 
2.  Intersections must be designed with adequate corner site distance. Corner site distances is defined as measured from a point on the centerline of the right-hand travel lane of the minor road at least fifteen feet from the edge of a major road pavement and measured from a height of eye of three and three-fourths feet on the minor road to a height of object of four and one-half feet on the centerline of the travel lanes of a major road. The corner site distance for local and collector streets will be a minimum of two hundred feet. On arterial streets, corner site distance will be three hundred fifty feet. In addition to the corner site distance requirement, no fence, wall, entrance, hedge, shrub planting, tree or other site obstruction greater than two and one-half feet above the pavement elevation will be located within the triangular area formed by curb lines and a line connecting them at points thirty-five feet from their point of intersection. 
3.  Streets entering the opposite sides of a street shall either be directly across from each other or offset by at least one hundred twenty-five feet from centerline to centerline.

(Ord. 1769-2004 § 2, 2004; Ord. 1606-99 § 2(part), 1999). 
18.70.400 - Pedestrian and bicycle system. 
A.  Sidewalks. Sidewalks will be required parallel to all public streets and shall be sized depending on road classification and intensity of development. Alternative locations of sidewalks may be proposed by the applicant. In case an alternative location is proposed, sidewalks in the street right-of-way may still be required if close to a pedestrian generator, to continue a walk on an existing street, or to link areas of probable future development as indicated in applicable master plans. In conventional developments, sidewalks must be placed in the right-of-way, parallel to the street, unless an exception has been permitted to preserve topographical or natural features or to provide visual interest, or unless the applicant shows that an alternative pedestrian system provides safe and convenient circulation. All sidewalks must be installed before a certificate of occupancy will be issued or by the end of the one year warranty period for the public improvements for unoccupied lots. 
B.  Walkways. Pedestrian easements ten feet wide may be required by the city through the center of a block more than six hundred feet long to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping, or other community facilities. 
C.  Bikeways. Separate bicycle paths are required only if such paths are part of the adopted Clovis comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. 1606-99 § 2(part), 1999). 
18.70.500 - Minimum stormwater management requirements. 
A.  The requirements of this section shall apply to all subdivisions and any development of seven thousand square feet or more within the city planning and platting jurisdiction. The minimum stormwater management requirements shall apply to land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicable size if such activities are a part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. The city commission may, after considering the comments and recommendations of the public works director, grant an exception from the requirements of the minimum stormwater management requirements if it is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical characteristics of the site to meet the applicable standards. 
    This section shall be applicable to residential subdivisions, except those residential lots, subdivisions and units of subdivision which, on the effective date of this chapter, have infrastructure improvements installed in the subdivision or unit of a subdivision. 
B.  The minimum stormwater management requirement is that all applicable developments shall provide management measures necessary to maintain the post development peak discharges for twenty-five year frequency, one hour storm events at a level that is equal to or less than the respective twenty-five year frequency, one hour pre-development peak discharge rate, through stormwater management practices that control the volume, timing, and rate of flows. See Exhibit A, use as reference, for general guidelines. 
C.  Stormwater management measures shall be required to satisfy the minimum stormwater management requirements. The stormwater management practices utilized to develop a stormwater management plan shall be implemented according to the following order of preference. 
1.  Infiltration of runoff on site; 
2.  Off-site stormwater management utilizing an existing playa; 
3.  Flow continuation by use of open vegetated swails and natural depressions; 
4.  Stormwater retention structures; 
5.  Stormwater detention structures. 
    A combination of successive practices may be used to achieve the applicable minimum stormwater management requirements. The stormwater management plan shall be provided in the Clovis drainage plan and in compliance with the Clovis flood ordinance. 
D.  The owner/developer of a subdivision (or a unit of a subdivision) subject to this section shall submit a stormwater management plan at the time of submission of the subdivision plat for preliminary approval (final approval for all residential subdivisions that have received preliminary approval prior to the effective date). 
E.  The stormwater management plan for a subdivision may propose compliance in accordance with the requirements of a subsection B above by a subdivision-wide proposal or a lot-control proposal. For new subdivisions or units, it is preferred that a subdivision-wide proposal be submitted. 
F.  If a subdivision, after being fully developed, has or will have the potential to create a stormwater impact to downstream properties, the owner/developer must provide on-site stormwater management measures, unless the owner/developer is willing to build a structure to adequately facilitate an off-site stormwater management location (such as the next available playa, without impacting the intervening properties). 
G.  If a subdivision is located adjacent to a natural playa that receives runoff from the same water shed as the subdivision, off-site stormwater management utilizing the adjacent playa may be approved. 
H.  Whenever off-site stormwater management is proposed, the owner/developer must submit a stormwater control plan demonstrating that: (1) the plan will not impact downstream properties between the subdivision and the receiving property (playa), and (2) the plan will not reduce the original capacity of the receiving property to handle the pre-development runoff from the water shed. 
I.  The road system in most areas will be a primary element of the storm drainage collection system of a developed area. Wherever possible, road layouts and grades should be designed to avoid excessive runoff concentration and to minimize the need for storm sewers. Curbed roadways provide drainage outfalls for adjacent properties and site grading generally should provide for runoff from sites toward the roadway. Provisions shall be made in the design of roadways to manage stormwater throughout a subdivision or development. All storm drainage system components must be designed in accordance with the standards of the department of public works manual of construction standards. 
J.  Playa stormwater storage shown on the Clovis comprehensive plan and/or the Clovis drainage plan must be accurately defined. The size of the playa may be determined by the designated capacity found in the drainage plan. If a developer wishes to store additional stormwater generated by the subdivision or development, the size of the playa may be increased by the developer if approved by the city. 
K.  Existing drainage ways must be continued and be capable of carrying the historic volume of runoff. A drainage way shall be included in the subdivision or development plan if needed to carry stormwater runoff in excess of the event described in subsection B of this section. All drainage ways must be of sufficient width to carry the expected maximum stormwater flow as defined by the Clovis drainage plan and in compliance with the Clovis flood ordinance. An area at least ten feet in width along one side of the channel must be provided in addition to the drainage way channel. 
L.  All drainage facilities must meet the standards contained in the department of public works manual of construction standards. 
M.  If a stormwater management plan is approved for individual lot(s), a notation of the stormwater control requirement shall be identified on the plat in a manner approved by the city so that the stormwater management control will be identified as a burden on the lot that will run with the title of the property. 
(Ord. 1835-2006 § 3(part), 2006). 
18.70.510 - Retention/detention. 
A.  A residential subdivision-wide stormwater management plan that has a retention/detention area will be maintained by the developer, or is successors-in-interest, for a minimum period of one year from the completed construction of the retention/detention area. Any necessary repairs to the control area will be completed prior to the acceptance by the city. 
B.  A commercial subdivision stormwater management retention/detention area will be permanently maintained by the developer, or its successor-in-interest. Minimum standards established by this chapter shall be maintained at all times. 
C.  For planned unit developments, retention/detention areas may be combined with open/recreational spaces as dual use. In the event dual use is approved as a part of the development plan, the total area designated for retention/detention of stormwater shall be maintained by the developer or homeowner's association referenced in Section 17.30.330, and the city shall not assume ownership or maintenance responsibility. 
D.  All subdivision-wide stormwater management areas that will be maintained by the city shall be constructed without trees, shrubs or permanent structures that would interfere with maintenance requirements. The developer shall establish the retention/detention area with a native or drought resistant grass. 
E.  The inside slope of a retention/detention area shall be no steeper than a five to one ratio (horizontal:vertical). 
F.  The maximum depth of a retention/detention area will be two feet. The allowable depth shall be the vertical distance from grade level to the bottom of the retention/detention area. 
G.  Upon the recommendation of the director of public works, the commission may approve a deviation in the size and depth of a retention/detention area if the location of the retention/detention area is placed away from the streets and lots in a manner that will maximize visual and esthetic features, reduce or minimize health and safety risks, and not adversely impact the maintenance of the retention/detention area. 
(Ord. 1835-2006 § 3(part), 2006). 
(Ord. No. 1941-2010, § 3, 10-21-10). 
18.70.600 - Utilities. 
    The developer must coordinate with the affected utilities to provide utilities with sufficient capacity to serve any subdivision or development. Design and construction must be coordinated with the affected utilities. Utilities must be constructed according to the utility company standards and standards contained in these regulations and in the public works department and New Mexico standards. When public sewer and/or water is not furnished, Curry County and state of New Mexico regulations must be followed. If an alley is not provided in a planned development, a utility easement of sufficient width and accessibility must be provided and be part of the approved development plan. 
A.  Sewer. All collection lines for sewer must be located in an alley which serves adjacent property unless a specific exception is requested by the applicant and a plat or PUD development plan delineating such exception is approved by the city. 
B.  Mail Service. The method of mail delivery must be coordinated with the local US Postal Service and city staff. 
(Ord. 1606-99 § 2(part), 1999). 
18.70.700 - Other design requirements. 
A.  Access to Lots and Buildings. Access to lots and buildings must be provided in accordance with the Uniform Fire Code, as published by the International Conference of Building Officials, Chapter 10.207 (a) and (c). Except for cul-de-sacs, streets will connect with streets already dedicated in adjoining or adjacent subdivisions, or provide for future connections to adjoining unsubdivided tracts, or should be a reasonable projection of streets in the nearest subdivided tracts. A private road or driveway will connect to a dedicated street. 
B.  Public Safety within a Development. A design for a subdivision and/or a planned unit development must provide for public safety. The design will be reviewed by the city using the following standards: 
1.  Lighting is arranged so that an entry point, side walk, walkway, recreation area and parking area are adequately illuminated during the times of use. 
2.  Landscaping is arranged so that areas adjacent to entry points will not provide places of concealment. Plantings adjacent to a walk or parking area must be open or lighted so that a place of concealment is not created. 
3.  A development with a private road, walkway or parking area will provide to the city of Clovis an easement to each such area which will allow police and fire personnel access at any time. 
4.  A fence adjacent to a public right-of-way or easement will have an access point into any area without direct access to a public area. If locked, the access must have a lock on the easement right-of-way which can be opened by the police and fire department. 
(Ord. 1606-99 § 2(part), 1999). 
18.70.800 - Street lights, street signs. 
    Street lights and street signs will be provided as required by city regulation. See department of public works manual "American Standard of Construction Standards." 
(Ord. 1606-99 § 2(part), 1999). 
18.70.900 - Design standards which apply to a PUD. 
A.  Adequate design of grades, paving, gutters drainage and treatment of turf to handle stormwaters, prevent erosion and formation of dust; 
B.  Adequate safe and convenient arrangement of pedestrian circulation facilities, roadways, driveways, off-street parking and loading space, facilities for waste disposal and illumination; 
C.  Adequate amount and proper location of pedestrian walks and landscaped spaces to prevent pedestrian use of vehicular ways and parking spaces and to separate pedestrian walks and public transportation loading places from general vehicular circulation facilities; 
D.  Arrangement of buildings and vehicular circulation so that pedestrians moving between buildings are not unnecessarily exposed to vehicular traffic; 
E.  Proper arrangement of signs and lighting with respect to traffic control devices and adjacent residential districts; 
F.  An adequate amount and safe location of play areas for children and other recreational area according to the concentration of occupancy;
