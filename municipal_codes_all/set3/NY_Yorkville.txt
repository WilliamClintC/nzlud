ARTICLE I
Procurement Policy
[Adopted 12-11-1991]
§ 25-1. Review of purchases; exemptions from competitive bidding
requirements.
§ 25-2. Documentation of determination.
The decision that a purchase is not subject to competitive bidding will
be documented in writing by the individual making the purchase. This
documentation may include written or verbal quotes from vendors, a memo
from the purchaser indicating how the decision was arrived at, a copy
of the contract indicating the source which makes the item or service
exempt, a memo from the purchaser detailing the circumstances which
led to an emergency purchase or any other written documentation that is
appropriate.
§ 25-3. Purchases at lowest price required.
All goods and services will be secured by use of written requests for
proposals, written quotations, verbal quotations or any other method that
assures that goods will be purchased at the lowest price and that favoritism
will be avoided, except in the following circumstances: purchase contracts
over $10,000 and public works contracts over $20,000; goods purchased
from agencies for the blind or severely handicapped pursuant to § 175-b
of the State Finance Law; goods purchased from correctional institutions
A. Every purchase to be made must be initially reviewed to determine
whether it is a purchase contract or public works contract. Once that
determination is made, a good faith effort will be made to determine
whether it is known or can reasonably be expected that the aggregate
amount to be spent on the item of supply or service is not subject to
competitive bidding, taking into account past purchases and the
aggregate amount to be spent in a year.
B. The following items are not subject to competitive bidding pursuant to
§ 103 of the General Municipal Law: purchase contracts under $10,000
and public works contracts under $20,000; emergency purchases;
certain municipal hospital purchases; goods purchased from agencies
for the blind or severely handicapped; goods purchased from
correctional institutions; purchases under state and county contracts;
and surplus and secondhand purchases from another governmental
entity.
C. It shall be the policy that goods and services which are not required by
law to be bid may be procured by obtaining proposals or quotes, as
referenced in § 25-4, Methods of purchase, not to exceed the bid limits
of $10,000 for purchase contracts and $20,000 for public works
contracts. [Added 4-1-1996]

§ 25-5. Required documentation.
§ 25-6. Exceptions.
Pursuant to General Municipal Law § 104-b, Subdivision 2f, the

procurements for which, in the sole discretion of the governing body, the
solicitation of alternative proposals or quotations will not be in the best
interest of the municipality. In the following circumstances, it may not be in

policy in order to achieve the highest savings:

$250 to $2,999 2 verbal quotations
$3,000 to $4,999 2 written/fax quotations
$5,000 to $19,999 3 written/fax quotations or written request for
proposals
B. A good faith effort shall be made to obtain the required number of
proposals or quotations. If the purchaser is unable to obtain the
required number of proposals or quotations, the purchaser will
document the attempt made at obtaining the proposals. In no event
shall the failure to obtain the proposals be a bar to the procurement.
A. Documentation is required of each action taken in connection with each
procurement.
B. Documentation and an explanation is required whenever a contract is
awarded to other than the lowest responsible offeror. This
documentation will include an explanation of how the award will
achieve savings or how the offeror was not responsible. A
determination that the offeror is not responsible shall be made by the
purchaser and may not be challenged under any circumstances.

the best interests of the Village of Yorkville to solicit quotations or document
the basis for not accepting the lowest bid:
§ 25-7. Effective date; annual review.
This policy shall go into effect January 1, 1992, and will be reviewed
annually.
A. Professional services or services requiring special or technical skill,
training or expertise. The individual or company must be chosen based
on accountability, reliability, responsibility, skill, education and training,
judgment, integrity and moral worth. These qualifications are not
necessarily found in the individual or company that offers the lowest
price, and the nature of these services are such that they do not readily
lend themselves to competitive procedures. In determining whether a
service fits into this category, the Village of Yorkville Board of Trustees
shall take into consideration the following guidelines: whether the
services are subject to state licensing or testing requirements; whether
substantial formal education or training is a necessary prerequisite to
the performance of the services; and whether the services require a
personal relationship between the individual and municipal officials.
Professional or technical services shall include but not be limited to the
following: services of an attorney; services of a physician; technical
services of an engineer engaged to prepare plans, maps and estimates;
securing insurance coverage and/or services of an insurance broker;
services of a certified public accountant; investment management
services; printing services involving extensive writing, editing or art
work; management of municipally owned property; and computer
software or programming services for customized programs or services
involved in substantial modification and customizing of prepackaged
software.
B. Emergency purchases pursuant to § 103, Subdivision 4, of the General
Municipal Law. Due to the nature of this exception, these goods or
services must be purchased immediately, and a delay in order to seek
alternate proposals may threaten the life, health, safety or welfare of
the residents. This section does not preclude alternate proposals if time
permits.
C. Purchases of surplus and secondhand goods from any source. If
alternate proposals are required, the Village of Yorkville is precluded
from purchasing surplus and secondhand goods at auctions or through
specific advertised sources where the best prices are usually obtained.
It is also difficult to try to compare prices of used goods and a lower
price may indicate an older product.
D. Goods or services under $250. The time and documentation required to
purchase through this policy may be more costly than the item itself
and would therefore not be in the best interests of the taxpayer. In
addition, it is not likely that such de minimis contracts would be
awarded based on favoritism.

(1) Inspection. No person, firm or corporation or association who or
which is the owner of a building or structure in the Village of
Yorkville shall cause, suffer, allow or permit said building or
structure to become dangerous or unsafe to the public. In the event
that any building or structure now is or hereafter becomes
dangerous or unsafe to the public, from any cause whatsoever, said
owner or occupant shall repair or remove said building or
structure. In the event of the failure of the owner of any such
building or structure to repair or remove same, the Enforcement
Officer shall make a complete inspection and report the condition
to the Village Board of Trustees. Notice shall thereafter be served
on the owner or, if jointly owned, one of the owners, executors,
legal representatives, agents, lessees or any other person having a
vested or contingent interest in the building or structure. The
notice shall contain a description of the premises, a statement of
the particulars in which the building or structure is unsafe or
dangerous and an order requiring the building or structure to be
made safe and secure or removed. The notice shall also provide for
the time within which the person served shall commence and
complete the securing or removal of the building or structure. In
the event of the neglect or refusal of the person so served with said
notice to comply with same, a survey of the premises shall be made
by an independent building inspector and architect, named by the
Village Board of Trustees, and a particular builder, engineer or
architect appointed by the person so notified as indicated above,
§ 46-9 AMUSEMENT DEVICES § 46-9
40:51
and in the event of the refusal or neglect of the person so notified
to appoint such persons, the two appointed by the Village shall
make the inspection and submit the report to the Enforcement
Officer and the Village Board of Trustees. In the event that this
report further provides that the building or structure constitutes
an unsafe condition to the public, the Village Attorney will be
directed to petition the Supreme Court for an order determining
the building or structure to be a public nuisance and directing that
it shall be repaired and secured or proper demolition procedures
be taken.
(2) Posting of survey report. A signed copy of the report rendered by
the Inspectors appointed by the Village Board of Trustee shall be
posted on the building or structure.
(3) Costs of notice. All costs and expenses incurred by the Village in
connection with any and all of the proceedings indicated to include
the cost of demolishing and removal of the building or structure
shall be assessed against the owner or owners of the building,
structure and land on which the building or structure is located.
(4) Cost of removal. If such owner, owners or person served shall fail to
pay the costs and expenses incurred by the Village within 10 days
after being notified of the costs thereof by certified mail, the Village
Clerk shall file, immediately preceding the time for preparing the
annual assessment roll, a certificate of such actual costs and
expenses with a statement as to the property upon which such cost
and expense were incurred. The building(s) or structure(s) or other
obstructions removed with the Village of Yorkville Assessor, who
shall in the preparation of the next assessment roll of general
Village taxes assess such amount upon such property, and the same
shall be levied, collected and enforced in the same manner, by the
same proceedings, at the same time, under the same penalties, and
having the same lien upon the property assessed as the general
Village tax and as a part thereof.
(5) Reporting unsafe buildings. Any report received by the Code
Enforcement Officer, Village Board of Trustees or any elected or
appointed official of a suspected unsafe building or structure will
be immediately inspected by the Code Enforcement Officer and
other Inspectors as deemed necessary by the Code Enforcement
Officer. A report of findings along with recommendations will be
submitted to the Village Board as soon as possible after inspection.
(6) Imminent danger. When there is imminent danger of failure of
collapse of a building or structure which endangers life, or when
any structure or part of a structure has fallen and life is
endangered by the occupation of the structure, or when there is
actual or potential danger to the building occupants or those in the
proximity of any structure because of explosives, explosive fumes
or vapors or defective or dangerous equipment the occupants shall

Code Enforcement Officer." It shall be unlawful for any person
to enter such structure except for the purpose of securing the
structure, making the required repairs, removing the hazardous
condition or of demolishing the same.
(7) Emergency provisions. In cases of great emergency, where the

§ 70-4. Word usage and definitions.
A. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
B. As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
APPEAL  A request for a review of the local administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a
variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO, AH or VO Zone
on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one-percent
or greater annual chance of flooding to an average annual depth of
one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where
the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be
evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  The land in the floodplain
within a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. This area may be designated as Zone A,
AE, AH, AO, A1-30, A99, V, VO, VE, or V1-V30. It is also commonly
referred to as the "base floodplain" or "one-hundred-year floodplain."
For purposes of this chapter, the term "special flood hazard area
(SFHA)" is synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special
flood hazard."
BASE FLOOD  The flood having a one percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT  That portion of a building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
BUILDING  See "structure."
CELLAR  Has the same meaning as "basement."
CRAWL SPACE  An enclosed area beneath the lowest elevated floor,
18 inches or more in height, which is used to service the underside
of the lowest elevated floor. The elevation of the floor of this enclosed
area, which may be of soil, gravel, concrete or other material, must
be equal to or above the lowest adjacent exterior grade. The enclosed
crawl space area shall be properly vented to allow for the equalization
of hydrostatic forces which would be experienced during periods of
flooding.
DEVELOPMENT  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved
real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures,
mining, dredging, filling, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.

have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in Zones
V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure
member of the elevated floor, elevated above the ground level by means
of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the
flow of the water and adequately anchored so as not to impair the
structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude
of the base flood. In the case of Zones A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH,
B, C, X, or D, an elevated building also includes a building elevated
by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings
sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the
case of Zones V1-V30, VE, or V, an elevated building also includes a
building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building," even
though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls that
meet the federal standards.

detail in the Flood Insurance Study.
FLOOD ELEVATION STUDY  An examination, evaluation and
determination of the flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding
water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and
determination of flood-related erosion hazards.
FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM)  An official map of a

remains on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is
fully licensed and ready for highway use).
(2) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval of
the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies detected
shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project unless
immediately corrected.
E. Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's engineer or
architect shall make periodic inspections at appropriate times
throughout the period of construction in order to monitor compliance
with permit conditions and enable said inspector to certify, if requested,
that the development is in compliance with the requirements of the
floodplain development permit and/or any variance provisions.
F. Stop-work orders.
(1) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found ongoing without a
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 70-8 of this chapter.
(2) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found noncompliant
with the provisions of this law and/or the conditions of the
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 70-8 of this chapter.
G. Certificate of compliance.
(1) In areas of special flood hazard, as determined by documents
enumerated in § 70-6, it shall be unlawful to occupy or to permit the
use or occupancy of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate
of compliance has been issued by the local administrator stating
that the building or land conforms to the requirements of this
chapter.
(2) A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the local
administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in
areas of special flood hazard.
§ 70-13 YORKVILLE CODE § 70-13
67:84
(3) Issuance of the certificate shall be based upon the inspections
conducted as prescribed in § 70-13E, Inspections, and/or any
certified elevations, hydraulic data, floodproofing, anchoring
requirements or encroachment analyses which may have been
required as a condition of the approved permit.
H. Information to be retained. The local administrator shall retain and
make available for inspection, copies of the following:

this chapter.
C. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals may
appeal such decision to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article 78 of the
Civil Practice Law and Rules.
D. In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals, shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter and:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program of that area;
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
(10) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with
conducting search and rescue operations during periods of
flooding;
§ 70-19 FIREARMS § 70-19

including technical information and report any variances to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, providing items in § 70-19D(1)
through (12) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
(1) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure; and
(2) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D, E and F of this section are met;
and
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.
D. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
§ 70-19 YORKVILLE CODE § 70-20
67:94
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
G. Notification.
(1) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
(a) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance
coverage; and
(b) Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property.
(2) Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance
actions as required in § 70-13H of this chapter.

the time of connection.
C. A person is considered to be in violation of this article if the person
connects a line conveying sewage to the municipality's MS4, or allows
such a connection to continue.
A. Activities that are subject to the requirements of this section are those
types of activities that:
§ 113-5 RECORDS § 113-6
103:161
§ 113-7. Use of best management practices to prevent, control, and
reduce stormwater pollutants.
Where the SMO has identified illicit discharges as defined in § 113-2 or
activities contaminating stormwater as defined in § 113-6, the municipality
may require implementation of best management practices (BMPs) to
control those illicit discharges and activities.
§ 113-8. Illicit discharges in emergency situations.
(1) Cause or contribute to a violation of the municipality's MS4 SPDES
permit.
(2) Cause or contribute to the municipality being subject to the special
conditions as defined in § 113-2 Definitions, of this article.
B. Upon notification to a person that he or she is engaged in activities that
cause or contribute to violations of the municipality's MS4 SPDES
permit authorization, that person shall take all reasonable actions to
correct such activities such that he or she no longer causes or
contributes to violations of the municipality's MS4 SPDES permit
authorization.

provide, at his, her or its own expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the
MS4 through the use of structural and nonstructural BMPs.
B. Any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be,
the source of an illicit discharge as defined in § 113-2 or an activity
contaminating stormwater as defined in § 113-6, may be required to
implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and
nonstructural BMPs to reduce or eliminate the source of pollutant(s) to
the MS4.
C. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid SPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the
provisions of this section.
A. The SMO may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a
person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, to the health or welfare of
persons, or to the MS4. The SMO shall notify the person of such
suspension within a reasonable time thereafter in writing of the reasons
for the suspension. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension
order issued in an emergency, the SMO may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or to minimize
danger to persons.
§ 113-6 YORKVILLE CODE § 113-8
103:162
§ 113-9. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity SPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the municipality prior to the allowing of discharges to the
MS4.
§ 113-10. Access to facilities; monitoring of discharges.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any persons
discharging to the municipality's MS4 in violation of this article may
have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or
reduce an illicit discharge. The SMO will notify a violator in writing of
the proposed termination of its MS4 access and the reasons therefor.
The violator may petition the SMO for a reconsideration and hearing.
Access may be granted by the SMO if he/she finds that the illicit
discharge has ceased and the discharger has taken steps to prevent its
recurrence. Access may be denied if the SMO determines in writing
that the illicit discharge has not ceased or is likely to recur. A person
commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises
terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the
SMO.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that the SMO must
inspect to enforce any provision of this article, or whenever the
authorized enforcement agency has cause to believe that there exists,
or potentially exists, in or upon any premises any condition which
constitutes a violation of this article.
B. Access to facilities.
(1) The SMO shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject
to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security
measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make
the necessary arrangements to allow access to the SMO.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the SMO ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
and copying of records as may be required to implement this
article.
(3) The municipality shall have the right to set up on any facility
subject to this article such devices as are necessary in the opinion
of the SMO to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's
stormwater discharge.
(4) The municipality has the right to require the facilities subject to
this article to install monitoring equipment as is reasonably
§ 113-8 RECORDS § 113-10
103:163
§ 113-11. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence
via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous
materials, said person shall notify the municipality in person or by
telephone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications
in person or by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed
and mailed to the municipality within three business days of the telephone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial
or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment
shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions
taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least
three years.
§ 113-12. Enforcement; appeals of notice of violation.
necessary to determine compliance with this article. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at
its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and
quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(5) Unreasonable delays in allowing the municipality access to a
facility subject to this article is a violation of this article. A person
who is the operator of a facility subject to this article commits an
offense if the person denies the municipality reasonable access to
the facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this article.
(6) If the SMO has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued
hereunder, then the SMO may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.
A. Notice of violation. When the municipality's SMO finds that a person
has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this article,
he/she may order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person. Such notice may require without limitation:
(1) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
§ 113-10 YORKVILLE CODE § 113-12
103:164
§ 113-13. Penalties for offenses; other remedies.
(2) That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
(3) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected
property;
(4) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
(5) Payment of a fine; and
(6) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs. If
abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall
further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore
within the established deadline, the work will be done by a
designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense
thereof shall be charged to the violator.
B. Appeal of notice of violation. Any person receiving a notice of violation
may appeal the determination of the SMO to the Village Board of
Trustees within 15 days of its issuance, which shall hear the appeal
within 30 days after the filing of the appeal, and within five days of
making its decision, file its decision in the office of the municipal clerk
and mail a copy of its decision by certified mail to the discharger.
C. Corrective measures after appeal.
(1) If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the
requirements set forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of
an appeal, within five business days of the decision of the municipal
authority upholding the decision of the SMO, then the SMO shall
request the owner's permission for access to the subject private
property to take any and all measures reasonably necessary to
abate the violation and/or restore the property.
(2) If refused access to the subject private property, the SMO may seek
a warrant in a court of competent jurisdiction to be authorized to
enter upon the property to determine whether a violation has
occurred. Upon determination that a violation has occurred, the
SMO may seek a court order to take any and all measures
reasonably necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the
property. The cost of implementing and maintaining such measures
shall be the sole responsibility of the discharger.
A. Penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided
herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this article
shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a fine not exceeding $350 or
imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both, for
§ 113-12 RECORDS § 113-13
103:165
conviction of a first offense; for conviction of a second offense, both
of which were committed within a period of five years, punishable by
a fine not less than $350 nor more than $700 or imprisonment for
a period not to exceed six months, or both; and upon conviction for
a third or subsequent offense, all of which were committed within a
period of five years, punishable by a fine not less than $700 nor more
than $1,000 or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or
both. However, for the purposes of conferring jurisdiction upon courts
and judicial officers generally, violations of this article shall be deemed
misdemeanors and for such purpose only all provisions of law relating
to misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each week's continued
violation shall constitute a separate additional violation.
B. Injunctive relief. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any
provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this article. If
a person has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this
article, the SMO may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction
restraining the person from activities which would create further
violations or compelling the person to perform abatement or
remediation of the violation.
C. Alternative remedies.
(1) Where a person has violated a provision of this article, he/she may
be eligible for alternative remedies in lieu of a civil penalty, upon
recommendation of the Municipal Attorney and concurrence of the
Municipal Code Enforcement Officer, where:
(a) The violation was unintentional.
(b) The violator has no history of previous violations of this article.
(c) Environmental damage was minimal.
(d) The violator acted quickly to remedy violation.
(e) The violator cooperated in investigation and resolution.
(2) Alternative remedies may consist of one or more of the following:
(a) Attendance at compliance workshops.

(c) River, stream or creek cleanup activities.
D. Violations deemed a public nuisance. In addition to the enforcement
processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or permitted to
exist in violation of any of the provisions of this article is a threat to
public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a
nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's
expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin or otherwise compel the
cessation of such nuisance may be taken.
§ 113-13 YORKVILLE CODE § 113-13
103:166

§ 114-1. Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
A. Land development activities, as defined herein, and associated
increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of
local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes,
flooding, stream channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition;
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne
pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other
desirable species;
C. Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion
and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat;
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby
increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation;
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow;
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on
the waters of the municipality;
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from land development activities;
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the
public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety.
I. Regulation of land development activities by means of performance
standards governing stormwater management and site design will
produce development compatible with the natural functions of a

(1) Inspection programs may be established on any reasonable basis
after construction. The municipality may choose to conduct routine
inspections; random inspections; inspections based upon
complaints or other notice of possible violations; inspection of
drainage basins or areas identified as higher than typical sources of
sediment or other contaminants or pollutants; inspections of
businesses or industries of a type associated with higher than usual
discharges of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges of a
type which are more likely than the typical discharge to cause
violations of state or federal water or sediment quality standards or
the SPDES stormwater permit; and joint inspections with other
agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws.
(2) Inspections may include, but are not limited to, reviewing
maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface
water, groundwater, and material or water in drainage control
facilities; and evaluating the condition of drainage control facilities
and other stormwater management practices.

A. Construction completion guarantee. In order to ensure the full and
faithful completion of all land development activities related to
compliance with all conditions set forth by the Village of Yorkville in its
approval of land development activities, the Village may require the
applicant or developer to provide, prior to construction, a performance
bond, cash escrow, or irrevocable letter of credit from an appropriate
financial or surety institution which guarantees satisfactory completion
of the project and names the Village of Yorkville as the beneficiary. The
security shall be in an amount to be determined by the Village based on
submission of final design plans, with reference to actual construction
and landscaping costs. The performance guarantee shall remain in
force until the surety is released from liability by the Village, provided
that such period shall not be less than one year from the date of final
acceptance or such other certification that the facility(ies) have been
constructed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications
and that a one year inspection has been conducted and the facilities
have been found to be acceptable to the Village. Per-annum interest on
cash escrow deposits shall be reinvested in the account until the surety
is released from liability.
B. Maintenance guarantee. Where stormwater management and erosion
and sediment control facilities are to be operated and maintained by the
developer or by a corporation that owns or manages a commercial or
industrial facility, the developer, prior to construction, may be required
to provide the Village of Yorkville with an irrevocable letter of credit
from an approved financial institution or surety to ensure proper
operation and maintenance of all stormwater management and erosion
control facilities both during and after construction, and until the
facilities are removed from operation. If the developer or landowner
fails to properly operate and maintain stormwater management and
erosion and sediment control facilities, the Village may draw upon the
account to cover the costs of proper operation and maintenance,
including engineering and inspection costs.
C. Recordkeeping. The Village of Yorkville may require entities subject to
this chapter to maintain records demonstrating compliance with this
chapter.

the municipality by filing a written notice of appeal within 15 days
of service of notice of violation.
B. Stop-work orders. The Village of Yorkville may issue a stop-work order
for violations of this chapter. Persons receiving a stop-work order shall
be required to halt all land development activities, except those
activities that address the violations leading to the stop-work order. The
stop-work order shall be in effect until the Village confirms that the land
development activity is in compliance and the violation has been
satisfactorily addressed. Failure to address a stop-work order in a
timely manner may result in civil, criminal, or monetary penalties in
accordance with the enforcement measures authorized in this chapter.
C. Violations. Any land development activity that is commenced or is
conducted contrary to this chapter, may be restrained by injunction or
otherwise abated in a manner provided by law.
D. Penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided
herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this chapter
shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a fine not exceeding $350 or
imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both, for
conviction of a first offense; for conviction of a second offense, both of
which were committed within a period of five years, punishable by a
fine not less than $350 nor more than $700 or imprisonment for a

make it necessary or preferable to modify the location or design of such
required improvements, the Board of Trustees may authorize
modifications, provided that these modifications are within the spirit
and intent of the Planning Board's approval and do not extend to a
waiver or substantial alteration of the function of any improvements
required by the Board. The Board of Trustees shall issue any
authorization under this section in writing and shall transmit a copy of
such authorization to the Planning Board at its next regular meeting.

§ 118-12. Acceptance of streets or recreation areas.
be properly signed by the appropriate officer of the Planning Board
(Chairman or Acting Chairman) and may be filed by the applicant in
the office of the County Clerk. Any subdivision plat not so filed or
recorded within 90 days of the date upon which such plat is approved or
considered approved by reason of the failure of the Planning Board to
act shall become null and void, unless the particular circumstances of
said applicant warrant the Planning Board to grant an extension, which
shall not exceed two additional periods of 90 days.
B. Plat void if revised after approval. No changes, erasures, modifications
or revisions shall be made in any subdivision plat after approval has
been given by the Planning Board and endorsed, in writing, on the plat
unless said plat is first resubmitted to the Planning Board and such
Board approves any modifications. In the event that any such
subdivision plat is recorded without complying with this requirement,
the same shall be considered null and void, and the Board shall institute
proceedings to have the plat stricken from the records of the County
Clerk.
A. Public acceptance of streets. The approval by the Planning Board of a
subdivision plat shall not be deemed to constitute or be evidence of any
acceptance by the Village of any street, easement or other open space
shown on such subdivision plat.
B. Ownership and maintenance of recreation areas. When a park,
playground or other recreation area shall have been shown on a plat,
the approval of said plat shall not constitute an acceptance by the
Village of such area. The Planning Board shall require the plat to be
endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect. The Planning Board may
also require the filing of a written agreement between the applicant and
the Board of Trustees covering future deed and title, dedication and
provision for the cost of grading, development, equipment and
maintenance of any such recreation area.

ARTICLE III
Design Standards
§ 118-13. Interpretation of standards.
In considering applications for subdivision of land, the Planning Board shall
be guided by the standards set forth hereinafter. Said standards shall be
considered to be minimum requirements and shall be waived by the Board
only under circumstances set forth in Article V herein.
§ 118-14. General requirements.
§ 118-15. Street layout.
A. Character of land. Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that
it can be used safely for building purposes without danger to health or
peril from fire, flood or other menace.
B. Conformity to Official Map and Master Plan. Subdivisions shall conform
to the Official Map of the Village and shall be in harmony with the
Master Plan.
C. Specifications for required improvements. All required improvements
shall be constructed or installed to conform to the Village
specifications, which may be obtained from the Village Clerk.
A. Width, location and construction. Streets shall be of sufficient width,
suitably located and adequately constructed to conform to the Master
Plan and to accommodate the prospective traffic and afford access for
fire-fighting, snow-removal and other road-maintenance equipment.
The arrangement of streets shall be such as to cause no undue hardship
to adjoining properties and shall be coordinated so as to compose a
convenient system.
B. Arrangement.
(1) The arrangement of streets in the subdivision shall provide for the
continuation of principal streets of any adjoining subdivision and
for proper projection of principal streets into adjoining properties
which are not yet subdivided in order to make possible necessary
fire protection, movement of traffic and the construction or
extension, presently or when later required, of needed utilities and
public services, such as sewers and water and drainage facilities.
Where, in the opinion of the Planning Board, topographic or other
conditions make such continuance undesirable or impracticable,
the above conditions may be modified.
(2) Subdivisions containing 20 lots or more shall have at least two
street connections with existing public streets or streets shown on
the Official Map or streets on an approved subdivision plat for
which a bond has been filed.
§ 118-13 RECORDS § 118-15
103:211
C. Minor streets. Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by
through traffic will be discouraged.
D. Special treatment along arterial streets. When a subdivision abuts or
contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the Board may require
marginal access streets, reverse frontage with screen planting
contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property line, deep
lots with rear service alleys or such other treatment as may be
necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to
afford separation of through and local traffic.
E. Provision for future resubdivision. Where a tract is subdivided into lots
substantially larger than the minimum size required in the zoning
district in which a subdivision is located, the Board may require that
streets and lots be laid out so as to permit future resubdivision in
accordance with the requirements contained in these regulations.
F. Dead-end streets. The creation of cul-de-sac or loop residential streets
will be encouraged wherever the Board finds that such type of
development will not interfere with normal traffic circulation in the
area. In the case of such streets, where needed or desirable, the Board
may require the reservation of a twenty-foot-wide easement to provide
for continuation of pedestrian traffic and utilities to the next street.
G. Block size. Blocks generally shall not be less than 400 feet nor more
than 1,200 feet in length. In general, no block width shall be less than
twice the normal lot depth. In blocks exceeding 800 feet in length, the
Planning Board may require the reservation of a twenty-foot-wide
easement through the block to provide for the crossing of underground
utilities and pedestrian traffic, where needed or desirable, and may
further specify, at its discretion, that a paved walk at least four feet
wide be included.
H. Intersections with collector, major or arterial streets or roads. Minor or
secondary street openings into such roads shall, in general, be at least
500 feet apart.
I. Street jogs. Street jogs with center-line offsets of less than 125 feet
shall be avoided.
J. Angle of intersection. In general, all streets shall join each other so that,
for a distance of at least 100 feet, the street is approximately at right
angles to the street it joins.
K. Relation to topography. The street plan of a proposed subdivision shall
bear a logical relationship to the topography of the property, and all
streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many of the building sites as
possible at or above the grade of the streets. Grades of streets shall
conform as closely as possible to the original topography.
L. Other required streets. Where a subdivision borders on or contains a
railroad right-of-way or limited access highway right-of-way, the
§ 118-15 YORKVILLE CODE § 118-15
103:212
§ 118-16. Street design.
Planning Board may require a street approximately parallel to such
right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the
intervening land, (as for park purposes in residential districts or for
commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts). Such
distances shall also be determined with due regard for the
requirements of approach grades and future grade separations.
A. Widths of rights-of-way and street pavements. Streets and pavements
shall have the following widths. The classification of streets shall be
determined by the Board.
Type of Street
Minimum Rightof-
Way
(feet)
Minimum
Pavement
(feet)
Major 66 40
Collector 60 30
Minor 50 26
B. Required street improvements. Not later than 90 days after the
granting of final approval, the subdivider shall have installed or shall
have furnished adequate bond or other security for the installation,
within a specified time, of the required improvements listed and
described in this section. All of the required improvements shall be
made by the subdivider in full compliance with the specifications for
each of the various units of work, as required by the Board of Trustees,
according to the nature of the improvements.
(1) Subgrade. The developer shall grade all streets from street line to
street line in accordance with cross sections and grades approved
by the Board of Trustees. The entire width shall be stripped, and all
objectionable material shall be removed and replaced with material
approved by the Village Engineer. After the subgrade has been
formed, it shall be thoroughly rolled and compacted. Fill shall be
made with material approved by the Village Engineer and shall be
placed in layers not over six inches thick, and each layer shall be
properly rolled and compacted. No base material is to be placed on
the subgrade until the subgrade has been approved by the Village
Engineer.
(2) Base course. The thickness and method of constructing the base
course may vary depending upon the amount of traffic anticipated,
the type of material used and the condition of the subgrade. A base
course equal to the width of the pavement and consisting of not less
than a compacted thickness of 12 inches of approved run-of-bank
gravel, laid in two layers, shall be constructed.
§ 118-15 RECORDS § 118-16
103:213
(3) Final course. The final course of the street pavement shall be as
specified by the Board of Trustees.
(4) No street shall be accepted until backfill in trenches has been in
place for at least three months. Where conditions warrant, the
Board of Trustees may require a longer period of time for
settlement of such backfill.
C. Street drainage.
(1) Street and road culverts, headwalls or other appurtenances shall
be installed by the developer where necessary. Where there is no
natural stream or watercourse for the drainage of surface water
from the proposed street or road, the developer shall secure rightsof-
way and construct ditches or install stormwater drains to a
natural waterway as the Board of Trustees directs. All street storm
and sanitary sewers shall be constructed according to the grades
on the plat submitted at the public hearing. Any changes in grade
shall require the approval of the Board of Trustees.
(2) Driveway culverts shall be not less than 12 inches in diameter and
20 feet in length and shall be of corrugated metal or reinforced
concrete. Installation is to be approved by the Board of Trustees.
D. Utilities in streets.
(1) The Planning Board shall require that underground utilities be
placed in the street at locations approved by the Board of Trustees.
The subdivider shall have installed underground service
connections in the street to the property line of each lot within the
subdivision for such required utilities before the street is paved.
Installation of fire hydrants shall be in conformity with all
requirements of standard thread and nut as specified by the New
York Fire Insurance Rating Organization and the Division of Fire
Safety of the State of New York.
(2) Utility poles, if used, shall be installed at locations approved by the
Board of Trustees.
E. Utility easements. Where topography is such as to make impractical the
inclusion of utilities within the street rights-of-way, perpetual
unobstructed easements at least 20 feet in width shall be provided with
satisfactory access to the street. Wherever possible, easements shall be
continuous from block to block and shall present as few irregularities as
possible. Such easements shall be cleared and graded where required.
F. Grades.
(1) Grades of all streets shall conform in general to the terrain and
shall be not less than seventy-five hundredths percent (0.75%) nor
more than 5% for major, 7% for collector or 10% for minor streets
§ 118-16 YORKVILLE CODE § 118-16
103:214
in residential areas, but in no case more than 3% within 50 feet of
any intersection.
(2) All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical curves of such
length and radius as meet with the approval of the Board of
Trustees, so that clear visibility shall be provided for a safe
distance.
(3) A combination of steep grades and curves shall be avoided.
G. Curves and visibility at intersections.
(1) All street right-of-way lines at intersections shall be rounded by
curves of a radius of at least 25 feet, and curbs shall be adjusted
accordingly.
(2) In order to provide visibility for traffic safety, that portion of any
corner lot (whether at an intersection entirely within the
subdivision or of a new street with an existing street) which is
within the triangular area formed by the intersecting street rightof-
way lines and a straight line joining said lines at 30 feet distant
from the point of intersection shall be cleared of all growth (except
isolated trees) and obstructions more than 2 1/2 feet above the
finished grade at the street center line. If directed, ground shall be
excavated to achieve visibility. [Amended 3-2-1993 by L.L. No.
1-1993]
H. Culs-de-sac. Where cul-de-sac streets are designed to be so
permanently, they should, in general, not exceed 500 feet in length and
shall terminate n a circular turnaround having a minimum right-of-way
radius of 75 feet and a pavement radius of 60 feet. At the end of
temporary dead-end streets, a temporary turnaround with a minimum
pavement radius of 50 feet shall be provided, unless the Planning Board
approves an alternate arrangement.
I. Watercourses.
(1) Where a watercourse separates a proposed street from abutting
property, provision shall be made for access to all lots by means of
culverts or other structures of design approved by the Board of
Trustees.
(2) Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement
or drainage right-of-way as required by the Board of Trustees and
in no case less than 20 feet in width.
J. Curve radii. In general, street lines within a block deflecting from each
other at any point shall be connected with an appropriate curve.
K. Reserve strips prohibited. Reserve strips of land to be used to control
access from the proposed subdivision to any neighboring property or to
any land within the subdivision itself shall be prohibited.
§ 118-16 RECORDS § 118-16
103:215
§ 118-17. Street names.
All street names shown on a preliminary plat or subdivision plat shall
be approved by the Planning Board. In general, streets shall have names
and not numbers or letters. Proposed street names shall be substantially
different so as not to be confused in sound or spelling with present names,
except that streets which join or are in alignment with streets of an abutting
or neighboring property shall bear the same name. Generally, no street
should change direction by more than 90° without a change in street name.
§ 118-18. Lots.
§ 118-19. Drainage improvements.
Adequate storm drainage systems shall be required in all new subdivisions.
The drainage system shall be designed by a person licensed to perform such
work.
L. Free flow of vehicular traffic abutting commercial developments. In
front of areas zoned and designed for commercial use or where a
change of zoning to a zone which permits commercial use is
contemplated, the street width shall be increased by such amount on
each side as may be deemed necessary by the Planning Board to assure
the free flow of through traffic without interference by parked or
parking vehicles and to provide adequate and safe parking space for
such commercial or business district.
A. All lots shall have area and width equal to the minimum requirements of
the zoning regulations, if any, and local and State Department of Health
regulations applying to the district in which they are located.
B. Side lines. Side lines of lots shall be at right angles to straight street
lines and radial to curved street lines, unless a variance from this rule
will give a better street or lot plan.
C. Corner lots. In general, corner lots should be a minimum of 25% larger
than interior lots to provide a desirable building site with proper
building setback from each street.
D. Driveway access. Driveway grades between the street and the setback
line shall not exceed 7%.
E. Access from private streets. Lots on private streets shall be deemed
acceptable only if such streets are designed and improved in
accordance with these regulations.
F. Monuments and lot corner markers. Permanent monuments meeting
specifications approved by the Village Engineer as to size, type and
installation shall be set at such block corners, angle points, points of
curves in streets and other points as the Village Engineer may require,
and their location shall be shown on the subdivision plat.
§ 118-16 YORKVILLE CODE § 118-19
103:216
§ 118-20. Parks, open spaces and natural features.
A. Removal of spring and surface water. Any spring- or surface water that
may exist either previous to or as a result of the subdivision shall be
carried away by pipe or open ditch. Such drainage facilities shall be
located in the street right-of-way, where feasible, or in permanent
easements having a minimum width of 20 feet and are subject to
approval of the Village Engineer.
B. Drainage structure to accommodate potential development upstream. A
culvert or other drainage facility shall, in each case, be large enough to
accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area,
whether inside or outside of the subdivision. The Village Engineer shall
approve the design and size of facility based on anticipated runoff from
a ten-year storm under conditions of total potential development
permitted by Chapter 135, Zoning, in the watershed. The cost of a
culvert or other drainage facility in excess of that required for the
particular subdivision may be deemed to be the responsibility of the
Village or may be prorated among the upstream property owners.
C. Responsibility for drainage downstream. The subdivider's engineer
shall also study the effect of each subdivision on the existing
downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision, and
this study shall be reviewed by the Village Engineer. When it is
anticipated that the additional runoff incident to the development of the
subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage facility
during a five-year storm, the Planning Board shall notify the Board of
Trustees of such potential condition. In such case, the Planning Board
shall not approve the subdivision until provision has been made for the
improvement of said condition.
D. Land subject to flooding. Land subject to flooding or land deemed by
the Planning Board to be uninhabitable because of flooding, soil
conditions or other such hazards to person or property shall not be
platted for residential occupancy nor for such other uses as may
increase danger to health, life or property or aggravate the flood
hazard, but such land within the plat shall be set aside for such uses as
shall not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or
improved in a manner satisfactory to the Planning Board and Board of
Trustees to remedy said hazardous conditions.31
E. All subdividers shall present an individual lot drainage plan for each lot
in their proposed subdivision. Such plan shall be used in the grading of
lots before a certificate of occupancy is granted, as required by Chapter
135, Zoning. No roof leaders or footing drains which carry stormwater
will be permitted to use a sanitary sewer or a so-called "dry well" in an
area where the dominant soil is harpan, but stormwater shall be
adequately disposed of upon the ground surface.
31.Editor's Note: See also Ch. 70, Flood Damage Prevention.
§ 118-19 RECORDS § 118-20
103:217
A. Recreation areas.
(1) The Planning Board shall require that the plat show sites of a
character, extent and location suitable for the development of a
park, playground or other recreation purpose in or adjacent to the
subdivision. Where a proposed park, playground or open space
shown on the Village Plan is located in whole or in part in the
subdivision, the Board shall require that such area or areas be
shown on the plat in accordance with the requirements specified
above. Such area or areas may be dedicated to the Village by the
subdivider if the Board of Trustees approves such dedication. A
maximum of 10% of the area of the subdivision may be required for
dedication for park, playground or other recreation purposes.
(2) In the event that an area suitable for a park or playground is
located in the subdivision, the subdivider shall submit to the Board,
prior to final approval, three prints (one on cloth), drawn in ink,
showing, at a scale of not less than 30 feet to the inch, such area
and the following features thereof:
(a) The boundaries of said area.
(b) Existing features such as brooks, ponds, clusters of trees, rock
outcrops and structures.
(c) Existing and, if applicable, proposed changes in grade and
contours of said area and of the area immediately adjacent.
B. Waiver of plat designation of area for parks and playgrounds.
(1) In cases where the Planning Board finds that, due to the size,
topography or location of the subdivision, land for park, playground
or other recreation purposes cannot be properly located therein or
if, in the opinion of the Board, it is not desirable, the Board may
waive the requirement that the plat show land for such purposes.
The Board of Trustees may then require, as a condition to approval
of the plat, a payment into a special Village Recreation Site
Acquisition and Improvement Fund of up to $200 per gross acre of
land included in the subdivision.
(2) Such amount shall be paid to the Board of Trustees at the time of
final plat approval, and no plat shall be signed by the authorized
officer of the Planning Board until such payment is made. All such
payments shall be held by the Board in a special Village Recreation
Site Acquisition and Improvement Fund to be used for the
acquisition of land that is suitable for permanent park, playground
or other recreational purposes and is so located that it will serve
primarily the general neighborhood in which the land covered by
the plat lies and shall be used only for park, playground or other
recreational land acquisition or improvements. Such money may
also be used for the physical improvement of existing parks or
recreation areas serving the general neighborhood in which the
§ 118-20 YORKVILLE CODE § 118-20
103:218
land shown on the plat is situated, provided that the Planning
Board finds there is a need for such improvements.
C. Preservation of natural features. The Planning Board shall, wherever
possible, establish the preservation of all natural features which add
value to residential developments and to the community, such as large
trees or groves, watercourses and falls, beaches, historic sites, vistas
and similar irreplaceable assets. No tree with a diameter of eight inches
or more as measured three feet above the base of the trunk shall be
removed unless such tree is within the right-of-way of a street as shown
on the final subdivision plat or individual house sites and driveways.
Removal of additional trees shall be subject to the approval of the
Planning Board.

Variances and Waivers
§ 118-25. Variances.
Where the Planning Board finds that extraordinary and unnecessary
hardships may result from strict compliance with these regulations, it may
vary the regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public
interest secured, provided that such variations will not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of the Official Map, the Master Plan or
Chapter 135, Zoning.
§ 118-26. Waivers.
Where the Planning Board finds that, due to the special circumstances of
a particular plat, the provision of certain required improvements is not
requisite in the interest of the public health, safety and general welfare
or is inappropriate because of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities
adjacent or in proximity to the proposed subdivision, it may waive such
requirements, subject to appropriate conditions.
§ 118-27. Conditions.
In granting variances and modifications, the Planning Board shall require
such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives
of the standards or requirements so varied or modified.

A. Purpose. The purpose of the F-P Floodplain Overlay District is to
delineate those areas which lie within the special flood hazard
boundaries as defined by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency's National Flood Insurance Program's Flood Insurance Rate
Map for the Village of Yorkville.
B. Procedure. The Floodplain Overlay District is an overlay. The uses in the
underlying districts are permitted subject to conformance with Chapter
70, Flood Damage Prevention, and approval by the Zoning Officer.
A. Purpose. The purpose of the Planned Development District is to:
(1) Provide for new residential, commercial or manufacturing districts
in which the economics of scale and creative and innovative
planning and architectural concepts and techniques may be utilized
by the developer without departing from the spirit and intent of this
chapter.
(2) Provide for the use of those relatively extensive land areas within
the community considered appropriate for the type of development
possible in a Planned Development District but for which no
development has been proposed.
(3) Ensure that the regulations of this section are so interpreted and
applied that the benefits of this chapter to the residents or
occupants of the Planned Development District and the residents or
occupants of adjacent properties will be protected.
B. Procedures. Planned Development Districts may be established in
accordance with the procedures specified below:
(1) Application for designation of a P-R, P-MH, P-C or P-M Planned
Development District shall be made to the Board of Trustees. The
Board of Trustees shall refer the application to the Planning Board
within 10 days of receipt. The applicant shall furnish basic data
pertaining to the boundaries of the proposed development, the
existing zoning, topography, drainage, soil conditions and such
preliminary plans as may be required for an understanding of the
type, uses and design of the proposed development.
§ 135-13 TAXATION § 135-15
121:281
(2) The Planning Board and the Board's professional planning
consultant, if any, shall review such application. The Board may
require such changes in the preliminary plans as are found to be
necessary to meet the requirements of this section, to protect the
established permitted uses in the vicinity and to promote the
orderly growth and sound development of the community. In
evaluating the proposal and in reaching its decision regarding the
preliminary plans, the Planning Board shall consider and make
findings regarding the following:
(a) The existing character of the neighborhood.
(b) The location of principal and accessory buildings on the site in
relation to one another and to other structures and uses in the
vicinity.
(c) The pedestrian circulation and open space in relation to
structures.
(d) The traffic circulation features within the site and the amount
of, location of and access to automobile parking areas and
loading areas.
(e) The height and bulk of buildings.
(f) The proposed location, type and size of signs, driveways and
landscape features.
(g) The safeguards provided to minimize possible detrimental
effects of the proposed use on adjacent properties and the
neighborhood in general.
(h) Storm drainage, sanitary and solid waste disposal and other
utilities on and adjacent to the site.
(3) The Planning Board shall report its findings and render its decision
to the Board of Trustees within 45 days. It may approve, disapprove
or give conditional approval subject to modifications regarding the
proposed development.
(4) The Board of Trustees shall hold a public hearing after public
notice as required for any amendment to this chapter and shall
consider the report and recommendations of the Planning Board
and all other comments, reviews and statements pertaining
thereto. It may amend the Zoning Map to establish and define the
type and boundaries of the planned district and in so doing may
state specific conditions, in addition to those provided by this
chapter, further restricting the nature or design of the
development. In the event that the Planning Board disapproved the
proposal or rendered conditional approval subject to modifications
with which the developer is not willing to comply, the Board of
Trustees may amend the Zoning Map in accordance with the
§ 135-15 YORKVILLE CODE § 135-15
121:282
application only upon an affirmative vote of at least three-fourths
(3/4) of the members of the Board of Trustees.
(5) Amendment of the Zoning Map shall not constitute authorization to
develop in the district. Such authorization, after a planned
development district has been established, shall require that the
applicant submit to the Planning Board such further plans and
specifications, supporting documents and data as shall be required
by the Board and shall specify on the plans and in writing the
building types and layout, setbacks, off-street parking and loading,
ingress and egress, signs, existing and proposed amenities,
screening, planting and ornamental features and the plan or
arrangements for development the area of in stages or in its
entirety.
(6) All conditions imposed by the Board of Trustees in its amendment
and all subsequent conditions imposed by the Planning Board in its
review of the final plans, including any the performance of which
may be conditions precedent to the issuance of any permit, shall
run with the land and shall not lapse or be waived as a result of any
change in tenancy or ownership of any or all of the designated
district. No building permit shall be issued until the Planning Board
has rendered final approval and has authorized issuance of a
permit by resolution.
(7) If construction of the development in accordance with the approved
plans and specifications has not begun within one year after the
date of issuance of the building permit, all permits shall become
null and void, the approval shall be deemed revoked and vacated
and the Board of Trustees shall have the authority to again amend
the map to restore the zoning designation for the district to that
which it had been prior to the application or to any other district.
C. Standards for development.
(1) Permitted uses in P-R, P-MH, P-C and P-M Planned Development
Districts and area and yard dimensions shall be as approved by the
Planning Board using the requirements of Schedule A as
guidelines.38
(2) Building height shall be limited to 40 feet for commercial or
industrial uses.
(3) Locations for ingress and egress, off-street parking and off-street
loading in P-C and P-M Districts shall be so arranged as not to
connect directly with local residential streets and shall not cause
excessive conflict with pedestrian or motor traffic.
38.Editor's Note: Schedule A is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 135-15 TAXATION § 135-15
121:283
(4) The standards established for signs in § 135-25 shall be used as
guidelines in the review of any proposed signs and according to the
comparable classification for any Planned Development District.
D. P-D Planned Development District (general). The Planned Development
District created by this chapter is intended to identify certain
distinctive areas of the community which are relatively extensive and in
which existing uses may be marginal and subject, therefore, to
discontinuance. Such areas are expressly regarded as primarily suited
for uses other than those presently occupying all or part of these
districts but wherein it is not possible to select specific development
objectives until other conditions are satisfied. Therefore, in a P-D
Planned Development District, only existing uses and uses accessory to
existing uses are permitted. No additional development or other use
may be permitted except as may be allowable after procedures for
rezoning of the area to a specific Planned Development District as
described by this chapter are fully accomplished and the Zoning Map
has been duly amended to designate such area as P-R Planned
Residential, P-MH Planned Mobile Home Park, P-C Planned
Commercial, or P-M Planned Manufacturing, after preliminary
evaluation and review procedures, as provided.
(1) The Planning Board shall approve, approve with modification or
disapprove an application for designation of a Planned
Development District amendment of the Zoning Map of the Village
or for a building project within an established Planned
Development District and shall report its findings to the Board of
Trustees within 45 days following the date of referral to the
Planning Board by the Board of Trustees. Planning Board approval
of the preliminary plans shall not constitute or imply a permit for
said project.
(2) The Board of Trustees shall hold a public hearing on any proposal
to create or change a Planned Development District, with public
notice, as provided by law as in the case of any amendment to this
chapter. The Board of Trustees may amend the chapter to establish
and define the type and boundaries of the planned district after a
public hearing.
(3) A building project within a planned district shall conform
substantially to the preliminary construction plans approved by the
Planning Board. A building permit may be issued only after
construction plans and specifications have been filed and approved
by resolution of the Board of Trustees. In the event that the
Planning Board disapproves a building permit within a Planned
Development District or approves with modifications which the
applicant is unwilling to make, an affirmative vote of not less than
3/4 of the members of the Board of Trustees shall be required to
approve said building project.
§ 135-15 YORKVILLE CODE § 135-15
121:284
(4) If construction work on the proposed building project is not begun
within time limits specified by the building permit or if such work is
not completed within the period of time specified by such permit,
approval of the project application shall become null and void, and
all rights therein shall cease, unless the Board of Trustees for good
cause authorizes an extension.
(5) All conditions imposed by the Board of Trustees, including those
the performance of which are conditions precedent to the issuance
of any permit necessary for the development of any part of the
entire site, shall run with the land and shall not lapse or be waived
as a result of any subsequent change in the tenancy or ownership of
any or all of said area. Such conditions shall be stated in any
certificate or occupancy issued for any use or structure in such
development.

ARTICLE IV
Supplementary Regulations
§ 135-16. Lot, yard and building regulations.
Regulations governing lot area and lot width, front, side and rear yards,
building coverage and building height are specified in Schedule A and
in the additional regulations of this Article and are supplemented by the
regulations of other sections of this chapter. Schedule A accompanies and,
with all explanatory matter thereon, is hereby made a part of this chapter.39
§ 135-17. Additional area regulations.
A. Existing lots of record. A single-family structure may be constructed on
any lot of record filed in the County Clerk's office in any residence
district even if said lot has less than the minimum area required for
building lots in the district in which it is located, subject to the following
conditions:
(1) Adjoining vacant land. The owner of said lot owns no adjoining
vacant land which would create a conforming lot if combined with
the lot which is deficient in area.
(2) Side yards. Any structure erected on a nonconforming lot shall
have a minimum side yard of three feet or a minimum side yard of
10 feet adjacent to a side street lot line.
(3) Front and rear yards. Any structure erected on a nonconforming lot
shall have front and rear yards conforming to the minimum
required for the residence district in which said lot is located,
except as said lot may meet the conditions set forth in this section
of this chapter.
B. Lot width. The minimum width of any lot shall be measured along the
minimum building setback line required for the district in which it is
located.
C. Reduction of lot area. The minimum yards and open spaces, including
lot area per family, required by this chapter shall not be encroached
upon or consider as yard or open space requirements for any other
building, nor shall any lot be reduced below the district requirements of
this chapter.
D. Number of dwellings on lot. Two permanent residential structures on
one lot, other than group housing, shall be prohibited unless lot area
and yard requirements are met for each dwelling, including required
street frontage.
E. Through lots. Where a single lot under individual ownership extends
from one street to another parallel or nearly parallel street or alley, the
39.Editor's Note: Schedule A is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 135-16 TAXATION § 135-17
121:287
wider street shall be deemed the street upon which the property fronts,
and no principal structures and no dwelling shall be erected on the rear
of such a lot, except where such lot may be subdivided to create not
fewer than two conforming lots. Where a single lot extends between
two streets of equal width, either of the two streets may be deemed
as that upon which the property fronts. The building height shall be
measured from the grade of the street on which the building fronts.
F. Visibility at street corners. On a corner lot in any district where a front
yard is required, no fence, wall, hedge or other structure or planting
more than 2 1/2 feet above the finished grade on the street center line
shall be erected, placed or maintained so as to obstruct visibility of
vehicular traffic within the triangular area formed by the intersecting
street right-of-way lines and a straight line joining said lines at points
30 feet distant from the point of intersection, measured along said lines.
G. Front yard exception. When a vacant lot is situated between two
improved lots, each having a principal building within 25 feet of any
side lot line of such unimproved lot, the front yard of the vacant lot may
be reduced to a depth equal to the greater of the depths of the front
yards of the two adjoining improved lots, but not less than 10 feet.
H. Transition yard requirements.
(1) Where a residential district abuts a nonresidential district at a
street line, there shall be provided in the nonresidential district, for
a distance of 50 feet from the district boundary line, a front yard at
least equal in depth to that required in the residential district.
(2) Where a district boundary line divides a lot in one ownership at the
time of adoption of said district line, the regulations for the morerestricted
portion of such lot shall extend not more than 50 feet into
the less-restricted portion, provided that the lot has frontage on a
street in the less-restricted district.
(3) Where the side or rear yard in a residential district abuts a side or
rear yard in a nonresidential district, there shall be provided along
such abutting line or lines in the nonresidential district a side or
rear yard at least equal in depth to that required in the residential
district. In no case, however, shall the abutting side yard be less
than 10 feet and the abutting rear yard less than 20 feet.
I. Projections into required yards.
(1) The space in any required yard shall be open and unobstructed
except for accessory buildings in a side or rear yard and except for
the ordinary projections of windowsills, belt courses, cornices,
eaves and other architectural features; provided, however, that
such features shall not project more than two feet into any required
yard.
§ 135-17 YORKVILLE CODE § 135-17
121:288
(2) A paved terrace shall not be considered as part of a building in the
determination of yard sizes or lot coverage, provided that such
terrace is unroofed and without walls, parapets or other form of
enclosures exceeding four feet in height.
(3) In determining the percentage of building coverage or the size of
yards for the purpose of this chapter roofed or enclosed porches
shall be considered a part of the building.
(4) An open fire escape may extend into any required yard not more
than six feet, provided that such fire escape shall not be closer than
four feet at any point to any lot line.
(5) Unenclosed entrance steps or stairways providing access to the
first story of a building may extend into any required yard a
distance not to exceed six feet.
J. Walls, fences and hedges. [Amended 3-5-1991 by L.L. No. 1-1991]
(1) No fences, walls, barricades, or structures similar thereto shall be
erected or maintained in the front yard, nor shall they protrude into
Village streets or pedestrian walkways to create a traffic hazard or
to obstruct the free use of said street or walkway, or to endanger
the person or property of any other person, This provision does not
apply to unenclosed commercial or industrial uses. [Amended
9-4-2012 by L.L. No. 4-2012; 10-3-2017 by L.L. No. 3-2017;
5-1-2018 by L.L. No. 2-2018]
(2) All fences, walls, barricades or structures similar thereto shall be
properly erected, supported and braced with the smooth side
facing the neighbor and the constructed side facing the
homeowner. [Amended 5-17-2011 by L.L. No. 3-2011]
(3) No barbed-wire fence shall be erected or maintained within the
limits of the Village of Yorkville.
K. Side yards.
(1) Side yard width may be varied. Where the side wall of a building is
not parallel with the side lot line or is broken or otherwise
irregular, the side yard may be varied. In such case, the average
width of the side yard shall not be less than the otherwise required
minimum width; provided, however, that such side yard shall not be
narrower at any one point than one-half (1/2) the otherwise
required minimum width.
(2) Width of one side yard may be reduced. When authorized as a
variance by the Board of Appeals, the width of one side yard may be
reduced to a width of not less than five feet, provided that the sum
of the widths of the two side yards is not less than the required
minimum for both side yards, and further provided that the
distance between the proposed structure and any structure
§ 135-17 TAXATION § 135-17
121:289
§ 135-18. Additional height restrictions.
§ 135-19. Accessory buildings.
existing or proposed on an adjacent lot is not less than the required
minimum sum of the widths of the two side yards. Such reduction
may be authorized only when the Board of Appeals finds it to be
warranted by the location of existing buildings or conducive to the
desirable development of two or more lots.
A. General application. No building or structure shall have a greater
number of stories nor have an aggregate height of a greater number of
feet than is permitted in the district in which such building or structure
is located, except as noted elsewhere in this chapter.
B. Chimneys, spires, etc. The height limitations of this chapter shall not
apply to belfries, church spires, cupolas, penthouses and domes which
are not used for human occupancy, nor to chimneys, ventilators,
skylights, water tanks and necessary mechanical appurtenances usually
carried above the roof level nor to flagpoles, monuments, transmission
towers and cables, radio and television antennas or towers and similar
structures. Such features, however, shall be erected only to such height
as is necessary to accomplish the purpose for which they are intended.
No advertising device of any kind whatsoever shall be inscribed upon or
attached to that part of any chimney, tower, tank or other structure
which extends above the height limitations.
C. Permitted exceptions to height regulations. Schools, public buildings
and institutions may be erected to a height not exceeding 85 feet in any
district in which they are permitted, provided that front, side and rear
yards are increased in width one foot for each foot of height that the
building exceeds the height regulations of the district in which it is
located.
A. Number.
(1) On any lot intended or used for residential purposes, one accessory
building, in addition to a private garage, such as a home workshop,
storage shed or like structure for personal use related and

or 15 feet.
C. Location. Accessory buildings in residence districts which are not
attached to a principal building may be erected within the rear yard in
accordance with the following requirements:

accordance with this subsection, the owner shall provide a fence,
§ 135-19 TAXATION § 135-22
121:291
§ 135-23. Swimming pools.
A private outdoor swimming pool shall be permitted as an accessory use to
a dwelling unit only in accordance with the following regulations:
screen or landscaping sufficient to obscure such use from view from
abutting properties in residence districts or from the public right-ofway.
B. Unenclosed uses. Any commercial or industrial use which is not
conducted within a completely enclosed building, including but not
limited to junkyards, storage yards and used building material yards,
and which use is in, abuts or is adjacent to a residence district or fronts
on a public right-of-way shall be screened from view from such
residence districts and public rights-of-way in an effective manner. The
provisions in § 135-17J(1) do not apply in the case of an unenclosed
commercial or industrial use.
C. Approval by the Planning Board. Plans and site design for the
installation of such fencing or screening as is required by this chapter
shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning Board prior to issuance
of a building permit. Any fencing or screening in accordance with this
section shall be maintained in good order to achieve the objectives of
this section. Failure to maintain fencing, screening or plant material
shall be considered a violation of this chapter.
A. Such pool shall be accessory to a principal residential use and shall be
erected only on the same lot as the principal structure.
B. Such pool may be erected or constructed only in the side or rear yard of
the lot and shall conform to the yard requirements set forth in
§ 135-19C of this chapter. [Amended 9-4-2012 by L.L. No. 4-2012]
C. The fence shall be no closer than five feet to any property boundary line
and shall be constructed in such a manner that no footholes shall be
found on the outside of the structure facing away from the pool. Where
a picket-type fence is provided, horizontal openings between pickets
shall not exceed 3 1/2 inches; and where a chain link fence is provided,
the openings between links shall not exceed 2 3/8 inches. The purpose
of this requirement is to ensure that no one will use footholes or boards
or other material to place their foot into to climb over the fence into the
pool. Gates to the pool shall be constructed so that no one can enter
from the outside of the pool with the latch being the type required by
the New York State Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code. When
obtaining a permit, which shall be required for the construction of any
type pool, whether above or below ground, the person seeking the
permit shall also receive a permit for the fence and shall give a detailed
description with full specifications for the permit. [Amended 3-5-1991
by L.L. No. 1-1991]
§ 135-22 YORKVILLE CODE § 135-23
121:292
D. Such pool shall be adequately screened or otherwise situated so as not
to be obtrusive from the public right-of-way or to present a nuisance to
any adjoining use.
E. Such pool shall not adversely affect the character of any residential
neighborhood, and all lighting or other appurtenances shall be so
arranged as not to interfere with neighboring uses.
F. In addition, a swimming pool to be constructed or installed as an
accessory use to a motel, tourist or like accommodation or as part of
any commercial or club facility shall be permitted after application to
and issuance of a permit therefor by the enforcement officer. Such
swimming pool shall be so located as not to cause a hazard or nuisance
and shall be designed and located in accord with acceptable
engineering standards and any applicable county or state
requirements.
G. In respect to the maintenance for the regular use as a swimming pool
and the fence, it shall be required that the fence shall be of sturdy
construction and shall be maintained in a sturdy workmanlike
construction with all fence posts and other materials to be sound and all
posts to be securely placed into the ground. In the event that the pool is
not being used during any time of the year, it shall have a proper cover
manufactured by a swimming pool manufacturer and shall be securely
tied down at all times. The intent of this section is to ensure that if a
pool is used seasonally, it should be fully covered the balance of the
year, and the intent is also that if a pool is not being used seasonally, it
shall be covered throughout the year. Pools that do not continue to meet
the standards of the New York State Uniform Fire Prevention and
Building Code and become in disrepair shall be properly closed and
filled in with the proper material to fully protect the public and to keep
from being unsightly or a health hazard due to the lack of insect control
or other health reasons. [Added 3-5-1991 by L.L. No. 1-1991]
H. Upon written specific notice by certified mail, the Village may require
existing pool owners to also abide by these rules and regulations
throughout this section. This section shall provide that the Village,
through its Zoning Enforcement Officer, will inspect all existing
swimming pools of an outdoor nature, either above ground or below
ground, and shall make specific recommendations pursuant to this
section to the property owner; but if the Zoning Enforcement Officer
feels that an existing pool satisfies the clear intent of this section, the
Zoning Enforcement Officer shall be able to approve the existing pool
for continued occupancy and use even though various pools may differ
somewhat in their present construction or state of repair. The intent of
this section is to make sure that all pools comply with a safe standard
for use and occupancy but at the same time to give the Zoning
Enforcement Officer the discretion to approve pools he believes to be
safe for the use of the homeowner and the homeowner's invited guests,
provided that they basically conform to this chapter. In the event that,
after being issued a violation notice, the owner does not agree, the
§ 135-23 TAXATION § 135-23
121:293
§ 135-24. Antennas.
The following regulations shall apply to all dish- or tower-type antennas:

property and all contiguous properties. At the request of the Zoning
Enforcement Officer, documentation of a maintenance program may be
required.
C. All towers and antennas and tower-type antennas shall have setbacks
from any lot line two times the height of the proposed structure.
[Amended 10-3-2017 by L.L. No. 4-2017]
D. Distance of any guy anchorage or similar device shall conform to the
minimum setbacks and/or yard requirements established for the zoning
district in which the structure is proposed.
E. Suitable protective anticlimb fencing and a landscape planting screen
shall be provided and maintained around the structure and accessory
attachments.
F. The applicant shall present documentation of the possession of any
required federal or state license.
G. No structure shall exceed the height limitations established for the
zoning district in which it is proposed.
H. Only one such structure shall exist at any one time on any lot or parcel.
I. The owner of such structure shall assume complete liability in case of
personal or property damage.
J. No dish- or tower-type antennas shall be placed in any front or side
yard.
K. Tower-type antennas or antenna arrays shall be erected only in Planned
Development Districts, and they shall meet all zoning requirements of
the zoning district in which they are located. [Added 10-3-2017 by
L.L. No. 6-2017]
§ 135-23 YORKVILLE CODE § 135-25
121:294
A. Intent. It is the intent of the Village of Yorkville that signs contribute to
the aesthetic character of the Village and do not adversely affect such
character.
B. General regulations. A permit is required from the Zoning Enforcement
Officer for the erection, alteration or reconstruction of any business or
advertising sign except where noted.
C. Sign measurement. The area of a sign enclosed in frames or cabinets is
determined by measuring the outer dimensions of the frame or cabinet
surrounding the sign face.
(1) Sign area does not include foundations or supports.
(2) For signs constructed of individual pieces attached to a building
wall, the cumulative area of the sign shall be determined by

The Board of Appeals shall have the following powers and duties prescribed
by statute and by this chapter as described below:
A. Jurisdiction:
(1) Appellate jurisdiction:
(a) Appeals from the interpretation of the Zoning Enforcement
Officer.
(b) To grant a variance in case of unnecessary hardship.
(2) Original jurisdiction: the granting of special exceptions for certain
uses stated in the chapter.
B. Interpretation: on appeal from a determination of the Zoning
Enforcement Officer, to hear and decide on questions where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination
made by the Zoning Enforcement Officer involving the interpretation of
any provision of the chapter.
C. Variances: on appeal from a determination of the Zoning Enforcement
Officer and in conformity with law, to vary the requirements as they
apply to a particular lot where the property owner can show that his
property was acquired in good faith and where the strict application of
this chapter would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary
hardship. No application for a variance shall be acted on until the
required public hearing has been held. The Board of Appeals shall
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards to carry out the
requirements of this subsection and shall not grant any variance unless
it shall make a finding of fact based upon the evidence as presented to it
in each specific case that:
(1) Because of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, shape or area of
the specific parcel or because of extraordinary topographic
conditions or other physical conditions or location of the specific
parcel, the strict application of the provisions of this chapter
actually prohibit or unreasonably restrict the use of the land or
building for which such variance is sought, that the granting of the
variance is necessary for the reasonable use of such property and
that the variance granted by the Board is the minimum variance
that will provide for the reasonable use of the property; or
(2) The granting of the variance will alleviate a clearly demonstrable
hardship as distinguished from a special privilege or convenience
sought by the owner, which conditions are peculiar to such land or
building and do not apply generally to land or buildings in the
vicinity or neighborhood and have not resulted from any act of the
applicant subsequent to the adoption of this chapter; and
§ 135-41 TAXATION § 135-41
121:307
§ 135-42. Special exceptions.
Special exceptions to be considered by the Board of Appeals include the
following:
(3) In any case, the granting of the variance will be in harmony with
the intent and purpose of this chapter, will not constitute, in effect,
an amendment of any district regulations or boundaries or uses and
will not be injurious to the neighborhood.
D. Special exceptions: On application supplementing an application to the
Zoning Enforcement Officer for a permit or certificate of occupancy, the
Board of Appeals may authorize the Zoning Enforcement Officer to
grant a permit for any use for which approval of the Board is required
by this chapter. The Board shall, pursuant to law, hold a public hearing
on any such application prior to acting thereon. In authorizing such
permit, the Board may designate appropriate conditions in harmony
with the following standards:
(1) The use shall be of such location, size and character that it will be
in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development of the
district in which it is situated and will not be detrimental to the
orderly development of adjacent districts and uses.
(2) The location and size of the use, the nature and intensity of the
operations involved in or conducted in connection therewith, its
site layout and its relation to streets giving access to it shall be
such that traffic to and from the use and the assembly of persons in
connection with it will not be hazardous or inconvenient to the
neighborhood or conflict with the normal traffic of the
neighborhood. In applying this standard, the Board shall consider,
among other things, convenient routes of pedestrian traffic,
particularly of children, relation to main traffic thoroughfares and
to street and road intersections and the general character and
intensity of development of the neighborhood.
(3) The location and height of buildings, the location, nature and
height of walls and fences and the nature and extent of landscaping
on the site shall be such that the use will not hinder or discourage
the proper development and use of adjacent land and buildings or
impair the value thereof.
A. Public utility stations or structures. Such uses shall include electric
substations, transformers, switches and auxiliary apparatus serving a
distribution area and water-pumping stations in any residential district
and shall be subject to the following regulations:
(1) Such facility shall not be located on a residential street, unless no
other site is available, and shall be so located as to draw a minimum
of vehicular traffic to and through such streets.
§ 135-41 YORKVILLE CODE § 135-42
121:308
(2) The location, design and operation of such facility shall not
adversely affect the character of the surrounding residential area.
(3) Adequate fences, barriers and other safety devices shall be
provided and the facility shall be screen-planted in accordance with
the provisions of § 135-22.
B. Drive-in restaurants or refreshment stands. In addition to meeting the
minimum yard and lot coverage requirements, such businesses, where
persons are served in automobiles or out of doors, shall be subject to
the following regulations:
(1) Such use shall be not closer than 200 feet to a residence district.
(2) Such use shall have frontage on a public street.
(3) Ingress and egress shall be so designed as to minimize traffic
congestion, and for this purpose, the number and location of
driveways shall be subject to review and approval of the Board of
Appeals.

adjacent residential property, and lighting shall be directed away
from adjacent property.

requirements, any auto wash establishment shall be subject to the
following regulations:

special exception by the Board of Appeals.
(1) Before a permit for a junkyard or automobile junkyard is

constitute a detriment to the public health, safety, welfare,
convenience and property values by reason of dust, smoke, fumes,
noise, traffic, odors and vermin or other conditions.
(2) The Board of Appeals may specify any reasonable requirements to

ARTICLE VIII
Amendments
§ 135-43. Initiation.
§ 135-44. Referral.
A. The Board of Trustees may, from time to time on its own motion, amend,
supplement, repeal or change the regulations and district boundaries
established by this chapter pursuant to law.
B. Whenever the owners of 50% or more of the frontage in any district or
part thereof included in such change shall present a petition duly
signed and acknowledged to the Board of Trustees requesting an
amendment, supplement or change of the regulations prescribed for
such district or part thereof, it shall be the duty of the Board of Trustees
to vote upon said petition within 90 days after the filing of the same by
the petitioners with the Village Clerk.
C. The Planning Board may, by resolution, propose an amendment to the
Board of Trustees suggesting a change or repeal of specific portions of
the regulations. Within 30 days from the time such resolution is filed
with the Village Clerk, it shall be the duty of the Board to vote on such
proposed amendment.
D. Amendment of this chapter may be subject to the state environmental
quality review process (SEQR). The Board of Trustees should identify
the type of action the zone change is according to SEQR regulations.
Depending on the size of the zone change and several other factors, it
may be a Type I or unlisted action. To make a decision, the Board should
consult Part 617 of the New York Codes Rules and Regulations (NYCRR)
and Article 8 of the Environmental Conservation Law.
E. If it is determined that an environmental impact statement will be
prepared for the proposal in question, all time frames and deadlines are
delayed until a draft environmental impact statement has been filed. An
application is not complete and therefore the review clock does not
start until a determination of no significance has been made or until a
draft environmental impact statement is completed.
A. All proposed amendments, supplements or changes originating by
petition or by motion of the Board of Trustees shall be referred to the
Planning Board for a report and recommendation thereon. The Planning
Board shall submit its report within 30 days after receiving such
referral. Failure of the Planning Board to report within the required
time shall be deemed to be disapproval of the proposed amendment.
B. Whenever any zoning regulation or any amendment including special
permits or variances would change the district classification of or a
regulation applying to real property in a neighboring municipality or
upon other county or state property as described in §§ 239-l and 239-m
§ 135-43 TAXATION § 135-44
121:313
§ 135-45. Hearing.
§ 135-46. Adoption.
After the public hearing and referral to and report by the Planning Board, a
majority vote of the members of the Board of Trustees shall be required to
amend this chapter, except as described in § 135-47, Protest petition.
§ 135-47. Protest petition.
If a protest against a proposed amendment, supplement or change is
presented to the Board of Trustees duly signed and acknowledged by the
owners of 20% or more of the area of the land included in such proposed
change or by the owners of 20% or more of the land immediately adjacent
extending 100 feet therefrom or by the owners of 20% or more of the land
directly opposite thereto extending 100 feet from the street frontage of such
of the General Municipal Law, said zoning regulation or amendment
shall be referred to the Oneida County Department of Planning, which
Department shall report its recommendations to the Board of Trustees.
Failure of the County Department of Planning to report within 30 days
may be construed to the approval by the Department.
C. The concurring vote of a majority plus one of the Board of Trustees shall
be necessary to override the County Planning Department
recommendations of approval with modifications or disapproval.
D. Within seven days after final action by the Board of Trustees on the
recommendations, modifications or disapproval of a referred matter,
the Board shall file a report of the final action with the County Planning
Department. Any defect in complying with this referral procedure will
render the Board of Trustees powerless to take further action under the
adoption procedure.
A. Before any amendment, supplement or change in the regulations or
district boundaries, there shall be public notice and a hearing thereof
as provided by law. Such hearing shall be held by the Board of Trustees.
In addition to the public notice of a hearing, notice shall be given, in
writing, either personally or by mail, to all property owners of the land
included in such proposed change and the land immediately adjacent
extending 100 feet therefrom and the land directly opposite thereto
extending 100 feet from the street frontage of such opposite land, as
said property owners and addresses appear on the latest completed
assessment roll of the Village.
B. Where more than 12 properties are included in such change and the
Board of Trustees, by resolution, determines that notice, in writing, to
each property owner is not feasible, the notice of hearing shall be
published in the official paper once a week for three successive weeks
and shall be posted in public places in the Village, of which six shall be
in the area affected.
§ 135-44 YORKVILLE CODE § 135-47
121:314
opposite land, such amendment shall not become effective except by the
favorable vote of at least four members of the Board of Trustees.
§ 135-48. Periodic review.
From time to time, at intervals of not more than three years, the Planning
Board shall reexamine the provisions of this chapter and the location of
district boundary lines and shall submit a report to the Board of Trustees
recommending such changes or amendments, if any, which may be
desirable in the interest of public safety, health, convenience, necessity or
welfare.
