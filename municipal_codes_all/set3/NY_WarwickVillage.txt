Zoning — See Ch. 145.
§ 5-1. Findings and purpose.
The Village Board hereby finds that poor quality of design, excessive uniformity and
dissimilarity of buildings and land developments adversely affects the desirability of
the immediate area and neighboring areas for residential and business purposes or
other purposes and, by so doing, impairs the stability and value of both improved and
unimproved real property in such areas, prevents the most appropriate development
and use of such areas, produces degeneration of property in such areas with attendant
deterioration of conditions affecting the health, safety and general welfare of the
community and creates an improper relationship between the taxable value of real
property in such areas and the costs of municipal services provided therefor. It is the
purpose of this chapter to prevent these and other harmful effects of such exterior
appearance of buildings and land developments erected or altered in any neighborhood
and thus to promote and protect the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the
community, conserve the value of buildings and encourage the most appropriate use of
land within the Village.
§ 5-2. Establishment; membership; terms; removal; vacancies.
There is hereby created an Architectural Review Board which shall consist of five
members who shall serve with no compensation. All members of the Board shall be
specifically qualified by reason of training or experience in art and architecture, or a
relevent business or profession, to judge the effects of a proposed building or land
development upon the desirability, property values and development of surrounding
areas. At least one member of such Board shall be a registered architect in the State of
New York. The members of the Architectural Review Board shall be appointed by the
Village Board, which shall designate a Chairman thereof. The term of office of each
member shall be three years, except that the initial appointments of one member shall
be for one year, of two members for two years and of two members for three years. The
Village Board shall have the power to remove any member for cause. Vacancies shall
be filled by the Village Board for the unexpired term of any member whose place has
become vacant.
§ 5-3. Meetings; decisions; requirements for applications before Board.
Meetings of the Architectural Review Board shall be held monthly and at such other
times as the Chairman may designated. A majority of said Board shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business. The Architectural Review Board shall keep
§ 1-13 ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW BOARD § 5-3
5:1
minutes of its proceedings. All reports, recommendations or decisions made by the
Architectural Review Board must have the approval of the majority of the Board and
shall be officially filed with the Village Clerk. All meetings of such Board shall be
open to the public. Applicants to the Architectural Review Board shall provide a full
set of plans and accompaning data for its use and permanent file. The applicant shall
not take action prior to receiving a decision from the Architectural Review Board.
The Architectural Review Board must take action within 15 days of the date of any
application referred to the Board as required in § 5-4. The applicant may be requested
to appear to review with the Architectural Review Board any submission to it. The
Architectural Review Board shall have the power, from time to time, to adopt, amend
and repeal rules and regulations not inconsistent with this chapter.
§ 5-4. Referrals.
The Building Inspector shall promptly refer every application for development or
subdivision of land and all commercial, industrial and recreational structures filed with
the Village Planning Board or Building Inspector's office. The applications shall be
referred to the Architectural Review Board within seven days, provided that it conforms
in all respects to all other applicable laws and ordinances. This chapter shall not apply to
an application for a one-family residence or residential accessory structure on individual
property, except that the Building Inspector, in his discretion, may refer such an
application to the Architectural Review Board if it appears, in the light of standards set
forth in § 5-5, that there is a need for such referral. The Architectural Review Board may
disapprove any application referred to it, provided that such disapproval shall be by a
unanimous vote.
§ 5-5. Criteria to be followed in making decisions.
The Architectural Review Board shall base its recommendations on the following
criteria. No building or structure or land development shall be so detrimental to the
desirability, property values or development of the surrounding area as to provoke one
or more of the harmful effects set forth in § 5-1 by reason of:
A. Excessive similarity to any other structure existing or for which a permit has been
issued or to any other structure included in the same permit application facing upon
the same or intersecting street and within 500 feet of the proposed site as measured
along center lines of streets in respect to one or more of the following features of
exterior design and appearance:
(1) Apparently identical front or side elevations.
(2) Substantially identical size and agreement of either doors, windows, porticos
or other openings or breaks in the elevation facing the street, including reverse
embankment.
(3) Other significant identical features of design, such as but not limited to
material, roofline and height or other elements, provided that a finding of
excessive similarity shall state not only that such excessive similarity exists
but that it is of such a nature as to be reasonably expected to provoke one or
more of the harmful effects set forth in § 5-1.
§ 5-3 WARWICK CODE § 5-5
5:2
§ 5-6. Consultation with Planning Board.
The Architectural Review Board shall consult with and advise the Village Planning
Board with respect to any site plan on which it is required to pass under the provisions
of this chapter. The Planning Board will make the final recommendation on every
application presented to the Architectural Review Board.
B. Excessive dissimilarity in relation to any other structures existing or for which a
permit has been issued or to any other structures included in the same permit
application facing upon the same or intersecting street and within 500 feet of the
proposed site as measured along center lines of streets in respect to one or more of
the following features:
(1) Cubical contents.
(2) Gross floor area.
(3) Height of building or height of roof.
(4) Other significant design features, such as materials or quality of architectural
design, roof structures, chimneys, exposed mechanical equipment and service,
service and storage enclosures, signs, landscaping, retaining walls, fences and
lighting posts and standards, provided that a finding of inappropriateness
exists, but not only that such inappropriateness exists but further that it is of
such nature as to be expected to provoke beyond reasonable doubt one or more
of the harmful effects set forth in § 5-1.

§ 7-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Architectural and Historical
District Local Law of the Village of Warwick, New York."
§ 7-2. Purpose; public policy.
A. Purpose. The Board of Trustees of the Village of Warwick finds that the Village
has a large number of commercial and residential structures which faithfully reflect
elements and characteristics of 19th century architecture. The Board of Trustees
recognizes that the existence of many 19th century buildings, especially within the
Historic District of the Village of Warwick, creates a unique architectural scheme
which is well preserved and scenically located. The Board of Trustees further
recognizes that preservation of Warwick's architectural character will promote
pride in the heritage of the community and result in direct economic benefits to
Warwick by uniformly preserving its distinctive character. Accordingly, the Board
of Trustees hereby creates the Architectural and Historic District Review Board
with power to review all changes in the exterior architectural features of
improvements located within the district.
B. Public policy. The Board of Trustees of the Village of Warwick hereby declares as
a matter of public policy that the protection, enhancement, perpetuation,
preservation and use of improvements of historic, aesthetic and architectural value
is a public necessity and is required in the interest of the health, prosperity, safety
and welfare of the people of the Village of Warwick. It is therefore the public policy
of this chapter to:
(1) Protect, enhance, perpetuate and preserve certain improvements located within
the district.
(2) Safeguard the Village of Warwick's historic, aesthetic, architectural and
cultural heritage as reflected in improvements located within the district.
(3) Improve and enhance property values within the district.
(4) Foster civic pride in the beauty and architectural achievements of the past.
(5) Protect and enhance the attractiveness of the Village of Warwick to residents,
visitors and business interests.

General Provisions
§ 9-1. Statement of intent.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Warwick recognizes that there are state statutory
provisions mandating villages to establish rules and standards of ethical conduct for
public officers and employees which, if observed, can enhance public confidence in local
government. In the light of a tendency today on the part of some people to downgrade
our local government and to discredit our public servants and our free institutions
generally, it appears necessary that every effort be made to assure the highest caliber
of public administration of this Village as part of our state's important system of local
government. It is the purpose of this chapter to implement this objective through the
establishment of standards of conduct, to provide for punishment of violation of such
standards and to create a Board of Ethics to render advisory opinions to the Village's
officers and employees as provided for herein.
§ 9-2. Interpretation of provisions.
The standards, prohibited acts and procedures established herein are in addition to any
prohibited acts, conflicts of interest provisions or procedures prescribed by statute of
the State of New York and also in addition to common law rules and judicial decisions
relating to the conduct of Village officers to the extent that the same are more severe in
their application than this chapter.
§ 9-3. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
VILLAGE — Any board, commission, district, council or other agency, department or
unit of the government of the Village of Warwick.

paid or unpaid or whether serving in a full-time or advisory capacity.
§ 9-4. Conflict of interest prohibited.
No Village employee shall have any interest, financial or otherwise, direct or indirect, or
engage in any business or transaction or professional activity or incur any obligation of
any nature which is in substantial conflict with the proper discharge of his duties in the
public interest.
§ 9-5. Standards of conduct established.
A. No Village employee shall accept other employment which will impair his
independence of judgment in the exercise of his official duties.
B. No Village employee shall accept employment or engage in any business or
professional activity which will require him to disclose confidential information
which he has gained by reason of his official position or authority.
C. No Village employee shall use or attempt to use his official position to secure
§ 9-1 ETHICS, CODE OF § 9-5
9:3
unwarranted privileges or exemptions for himself or others.
D. No Village employee shall engage in any transaction as representative or agent of
the Village with any business entity in which he has a direct or indirect financial
interest that might reasonably tend to conflict with the proper discharge of his
official duties.
E. A Village employee shall not by his conduct give reasonable basis for the
impression that any person can improperly influence him or unduly enjoy his favor
in the performance of his official duties, or that he is affected by the kinship, rank,
position or influence of any party or person.
F. Each Village employee shall abstain from making personal investments in
enterprises which he has reason to believe may be directly involved in decisions to
be made by him or which will otherwise create substantial conflict between his duty
in the public interest and his private interest.
G. Each Village employee shall endeavor to pursue a course of conduct which will not
raise suspicion among the public that he is likely to be engaged in acts that are in
violation of his trust.
H. No Village employee employed on a full-time basis, nor any firm or association of
which such employee is a member nor corporation a substantial portion of the stock
of which is owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by such employee, shall sell
goods or services to any person, firm, corporation or association which is licensed
or whose rates are fixed by the Village in which such employee serves or is
employed.
I. Each Village employee shall, to the extent that he is cognizant thereof, disclose any

adoption of this chapter shall remain in effect until such time as those application
fees are modified by resolution of the Village Board.

to be the minimum fee to be charged, and any additional costs and expenses actually
incurred by the Village for professional consultants, inspections (as well as all other
nonministerial expenses) shall be paid by the applicant in accordance with § 64-3

§ 63-1 FEES, CONSULTANT § 64-3
64:1
A. The applicant for approval of any land use or land development proposal shall
reimburse the Village for all of the Village's reasonable and necessary consulting
costs, as described herein, incurred by the Village in connection with the review
and/or approval of the application. Said fees and expenses are deemed application
fees. Reimbursement shall be made in accordance with this chapter. For the
purposes of this chapter, the term "land use or development" shall include, but not
be limited to, a subdivision, lot line change, site plan, conditional use permit, a
change of use application, special permit, wetlands permit, variance, interpretation,
appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals, or any modification or amendment of any
of the foregoing.
B. Initial Planning and Zoning review escrow deposits pursuant to the fee schedule
established by this chapter shall be delivered to the Village Clerk as part of the
original application.
C. No review shall be undertaken by the consultants, nor shall the matter be scheduled
before the Planning Board, Zoning Board, or Village Board, until the initial fee and
escrow deposit, as set forth in this chapter or the incorporated fee schedule, is paid.
A fee schedule shall be established, and changed as needed, by resolution of the
Village of Warwick Board of Trustees. A copy of the fee schedule is on file with
the Village Clerk's office and the Village of Warwick Planning Department. In
addition to the above-referenced fee schedule, the Planning Board may require an
applicant to pay an added amount, to be held in escrow and ultimately disbursed, to
pay the costs incurred by the Village for all consulting services it may reasonably
seek to engage, including, but not limited to, archaeological, engineering, planning,
legal and clerical costs incurred in processing and review of a subdivision or other
application. Such amount deemed necessary for escrow shall be reasonably related
to costs attendant to the Village's review, and such amount shall be computed by
the reviewing Board in consultation with the applicant. Further, if such escrow
payment is deemed necessary, this fee shall be in addition to and exclusive of any
fee(s) properly assessed to the applicant in connection with the SEQRA process.
D. In addition to the application fees required to be paid by an applicant, the applicant
shall also reimburse the Village for any and all fees paid by the Village in
connection with the review of such application by the Planning Board, Zoning
Board of Appeals, or Board of Trustees. With regard to applications to the Zoning
Board of Appeals for variances, the Village Board for zone change applications and
the Planning Board for subdivisions, conditional use permits, change of use
applications, lot line changes and site plan, the respective Board, as the case may
be, shall set an amount, in consultation with the Village Engineer, Planner and
Attorney, to be placed in an escrow account to be maintained by the Village for the
purpose of paying the fee statements of the Village professionals in connection with
the review of the application. Applicants before the respective Boards for other
relief shall pay the fee statements for Village professionals within 30 days of
presentation. All applicants shall be presented with a fee statement or statements
for such review and/or payment on a periodic basis or upon request.
E. If the escrow account falls below 80% of the initial deposit, the applicant shall,
unless waived by resolution of the applicable Board, pay additional funds into the
escrow account to maintain that account at 80% of the initial deposit.
§ 64-3 WARWICK CODE § 64-3
64:2
F. In the event that an applicant shall withdraw his application at any stage of the
proceedings or when the application review and approval process has been
completed, the balance of funds in the applicant's account after all current
outstanding fees are paid shall be either remitted to the applicant within 60 days of
final action by the board or, if so directed by the applicant, remain on deposit as the
applicant's initial payment toward post-approval inspection requirements (if
required).
G. The applicant shall remain responsible for reimbursing the Village its invoiced
costs and expenses in reviewing the applicant's land use application,
notwithstanding that the escrow account may be insufficient to cover such costs and
expenses.
H. In the event that the applicable board, in the course of reviewing an application,
determines that the proposed action requires a positive declaration under SEQRA,
all costs incurred by the board for review of any environmental impact statements,
whether of a professional or clerical nature, shall be borne by the applicant pursuant
to 6 NYCRR 617.8(a). Such costs shall be covered by an escrow account to be
established pursuant to this section within 15 days of issuance of said positive
declaration in an amount to be set by the applicable board pursuant to the fee
schedule set forth as part of this chapter.
I. All applicants with matters described herein pending before the Village Board,
Planning Board or Zoning Board of Appeals as of the effective date of this chapter
shall be required to comply with the new fees and escrow account maintenance
provisions contained herein.
J. In cases where the complexity of an application (or lack thereof) or unusual
circumstances surrounding the matter require that the initial fee or the percentage
of that initial fee to be maintained in escrow be modified, the reviewing board is
authorized to grant such modification within the following guidelines:
(1) The amount of any initial fee modification shall be reasonably related to the
costs attendant to the Village's review of the application.
(2) The amount of any escrow maintenance percentage shall be reasonably related
to the complexity of the project as well as the stage to which the project has
progressed as of the time of modification.
K. Each of the Village's engineering, legal and/or planning consultants who render
services pertaining to a land use or development application shall submit monthly
itemized vouchers to the Village Board (through the Clerk to the Planning Board
and/or Zoning Board), reasonably setting forth the services performed and amounts
charged for such services.
L. Copies of said itemized vouchers shall be transmitted to the applicant
simultaneously with their delivery to the Village Board, together with a notice
notifying the applicant that the failure to object to payment of the amount of the
charges contained in said itemized voucher out of escrow funds within 15 days of
the sending of said notice shall constitute an agreement by the applicant as to the
reasonableness of the charges. Presentation of such statements shall be deemed
complete when mailed by the Village to the applicant's designated representative.
§ 64-3 FEES, CONSULTANT § 64-3
64:3
M. The Planning Board and/or the Zoning Board (as appropriate) shall review vouchers
for services rendered to each and shall communicate its approval of same to the
Village Board. The Village Board shall review and audit all such vouchers and shall
determine, in its discretion, the engineering, legal and planning fees which are
reasonable in amount and necessarily incurred by the Village in connection with the
review and/or approval of the land use or development application. A fee or
expense of part thereof is reasonable in amount if it bears a reasonable relationship
to the customary fee charged by engineers, attorneys or planners within the region
for services performed on behalf of applicants or reviewing boards in connection
with applications for land use or development. The Village Board may also take
into account any special conditions for considerations as the Village Board may
deem relevant. A fee and expense or part thereof is necessarily incurred if it was
charged by the engineer, attorney or planner for a service which was rendered in
order to:
(1) Assist in the protection or promotion of the health, safety or welfare of the
Village or its residents;
(2) Assist in the protection of public or private property or the environment from
potential damage that otherwise may be caused by the proposed land use or
development;
(3) Assure or assist in compliance with laws, regulations, standards or codes
which govern land use and development;
(4) Assure or assist in the orderly development and sound planning of a land use
or development;
(5) Assure the proper and timely construction of public improvements, park and
other facilities which affect the public welfare;
(6) Protect the legal interest of the Village;
(7) Avoid claims against and liability of the Village; or
(8) Promote such other interests that the Village Board may specify as relevant.
N. After review and audit of such voucher by the Village Board, the Board shall
authorize payment of same and shall provide to the applicant a copy of the voucher
as audited.
O. The Planning Board and Zoning Board are hereby authorized, at the time of action
on any project, to require that payment of any amount overdue be a condition of
approval. No plat or plans will be signed, and no building permit or other permit or
certificate of occupancy shall be issued, until such time as all reimbursement of
costs and expenses has been fully paid. The Village Board, Planning Board, and
Zoning Board of Appeals reserve the right, at their discretion, to deny action to any
applicant with an overdue balance, until the account is brought into compliance
with this section.
P. Amounts paid pursuant to this chapter shall be placed in a trust and agency liability
account to fund expenses incurred by the Village in processing the application as
provided for in Subsection A above. The Village shall keep a record of the name of

§ 64-4. Appeals.
the applicant and project and of all such monies deposited and withdrawn. Monthly
vouchers submitted by the Village's engineers, attorneys and/or planners shall be
reviewed and audited by the Village Board and provided to the applicant, and the
applicant may appeal said audit amount as provided herein. The Village reserves
the right to redact any voucher as deemed necessary.
Q. All fee and expense reimbursement payments are due and payable within 15 days
after delivery of a copy of an itemized voucher to the applicant as provided for in
Subsection L above. Interest shall accrue on any unpaid itemized voucher at the rate
of 9% per annum. The pursuance of an appeal under this section or § 64-4 shall not
affect the obligation to pay interest on any unpaid balance ultimately determined to
be due.
R. Any applicant who disputes any fee statement presented to him pursuant to this
chapter may bring a proceeding in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, in
and for the County of Orange, pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and
Rules of the State of New York, within 30 days after presentation of such disputed
fee statement. The commencement of such a proceeding shall not stay the
obligation of the applicant to pay any fee statement presented to him pursuant to
this chapter.
S. Failure to reimburse fees. Any fee statement imposed by this chapter which remains
unpaid at the time the Village certifies its annual tax roll shall become a lien upon
the premises for which the application was made. Such unreimbursed fees shall
thereupon be levied against the said premises, as if a tax on real property, and in
addition to all other taxes, fees, rents or charges which would otherwise be so
levied. In the event the affected premises comprises more than one tax lot, then the
Village Treasurer shall distribute such levy equally among each such tax lot without
regard to assessed value or any other factor.
T. The provisions of this chapter are severable. If any clause, sentence, paragraph,
section, word or part of this chapter shall be adjudged by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the
remainder thereof but shall be confined in its operation to the clause, sentence,
paragraph, section, word or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in
which such judgment shall have been rendered. If any portion of this article is found
to be in conflict with any other provision of any other local law or ordinance of the
Code of the Village of Warwick, the provision which establishes the higher
standard shall prevail.
A. An applicant may appeal, in writing, to the Village Board for a reduction in the
required reimbursement amount. An appeal must be filed with the Village Board no
later than 15 days after mailing or other delivery to the applicant of the contested
voucher.
B. Failure to file an appeal within 15 days of the mailing of the voucher shall constitute
waiver of any objection to the charge.
C. Upon such appeal, the Village Board, in its discretion, may determine that an

of § 10(1)(ii) of the Municipal Home Rule Law and § 22 of the Municipal Home Rule
Law. To the extent that Village Law or any other provision of law does not specifically
authorize the Village Board, Planning Board or Zoning Board of Appeals to require
the reimbursement to the Village and the advance deposit of funds for engineering,
legal and planning fees and expenses incurred by the Village in connection with land
use, variance and development applications, it is the express intent of the Village
Board to supersede such statutes. Further, to the extent such statutory provisions do not
specifically authorize the deferral or withholding of decisions or other conduct by the
Village's boards in the event such fees and expenses are not reimbursed to the Village,
such statutory provisions are expressly superseded.

with an application matter for which the Village Board determines the applicant
bears no responsibility and which was beyond the reasonable control of the
applicant.
D. The Village Board's determination shall be in writing and shall be made no later
than 45 days after receipt of the applicant's appeal.

or proceeding in any state or federal court arising out of any alleged act or omission
which occurred or is alleged in the complaint to have occurred while the employee

B. Subject to the conditions set forth in Subsection A of this section, the employee

the employee shall be entitled to representation by a private counsel in any civil
judicial proceeding whenever the Village Attorney determines, based upon his

represented by private counsel. The Village Attorney shall notify the employee in
writing of such determination that the employee is entitled to be represented by a
private counsel. The Village Attorney may require, as a condition to payment of the
fees and expenses of such representation, that appropriate groups of such
employees be represented by the same counsel. If the employee or group of

this section, the Village Attorney shall so certify to the Mayor and Treasurer.
Reasonable attorney's fees and litigation expenses shall be paid by the Village of

harmless an employee with respect to punitive or exemplary damages, fines or

settlement, upon the head of the department, commission, office or agency in which
he is employed; and if not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, such

LOCAL RESIDENCY CARD PROGRAM
§ 85-1. Purpose.
Some residents of the Village of Warwick are unable to obtain photo identification cards
due to a variety of circumstances. It would serve the public welfare for the Village to
make local residency cards available to Village residents to assist them in interacting
with services and venues which require photo identification. At the same time, the
Village is not in a position to conduct investigations sufficient to guarantee the identity
of everyone who might apply for a local residency card. Therefore, the local residency
cards issued under the Village's Local Residency Card Program shall contain a suitable
disclaimer of legal responsibility on the part of the Village for verifying identification of
cardholders.
§ 85-2. Applications for local residency cards.
A. Applications for local residency cards shall be on a written form promulgated by
the Village of Warwick which shall require the applicant to provide:
(1) The applicant's name;
(2) The applicant's date of birth;
(3) The applicant's residence address; and
(4) The date on which the application is being submitted.
B. The application form for local residency cards shall include a space for signature by
the applicant averring that the information provided therein is true and accurate
under the penalties of perjury.
C. The application form for local residency cards shall further include space for
Village officials to complete, which shall state whether the application is granted or
denied. If denied, the Clerk's office shall inform the applicant in writing of the
grounds for denial. If granted, the Clerk's office shall complete upon the application
form a statement of:
(1) The date upon which the application was granted;
(2) The nature of proof of residency provided by the applicant; and
(3) That the Village Clerk's office has reviewed the proof of residency submitted
by the applicant and found it acceptable.
D. Applications for local residency cards must be submitted with proof of residency in
the Village of Warwick. Such proof may consist of any of the documents below
bearing the applicant's name and residence address; provided, however, that
addresses listing only a P.O. box shall not constitute proof of residency.
(1) Any government-issued ID card listing an address (e.g., a passport, a driver's
license or vehicle registration, a US permanent resident card or "green card");
§ 83-8 LOCAL RESIDENCY CARD PROGRAM § 85-2
85:1
§ 85-3. Issuance of local residency cards.
§ 85-4. Record retention and confidentiality.
The Village shall comply with all applicable laws regarding municipal record retention
by maintaining, for each local residency card issued, the completed application form.
Except for the application form, the Village Clerk shall not retain originals or copies of
any documents provided by applicants to verify residency in the Village of Warwick.
§ 85-5. Disclaimer. [Amended 1-21-2020 by L.L. No. 2-2020]
In providing local residency cards, the Village of Warwick is relying wholly and
(2) A deed or lease to residential property in the applicant's name;
(3) A notarized letter from a property owner or lessee representing that the
applicant currently resides upon or in his or her property;
(4) A local property tax bill, utility bill or insurance bill (homeowner, renter,

the date of the application for the local residency card; [Amended 1-21-2020
by L.L. No. 2-2020]
(5) A voter registration card or a jury summons with identity and address dated
not more than six months prior to the date of the application for the local
residency card; [Amended 1-21-2020 by L.L. No. 2-2020]
(6) A bank account statement or employment pay stub dated not more than six
months prior to the date of the application for the local residency card.
[Amended 1-21-2020 by L.L. No. 2-2020]
(7) For persons under age 18, residency may be established by submission of a
school record or report card listing a residence address;
E. Applications for a local residency card must be submitted with payment of
applicable fees as provided in this chapter. [Amended 1-21-2020 by L.L. No.
2-2020]
A. The Village of Warwick shall make available to any resident of the Village of
Warwick 14 years of age or more a local residency card displaying the cardholder's
photograph, name, date of birth and residence address. Local residency cards shall

85:2
exclusively upon information regarding identification and residency provided by
applicants. The Village of Warwick does not act as a guarantor or warrantor of the
veracity of such information. In recognition of this, each local residency card shall
include a disclaimer reading: "The Village of Warwick does not act as a guarantor or
warrantor of the identity of the cardholder and is relying wholly and exclusively upon
information provided by the applicant regarding identity and residency."
§ 85-6. Renewal of local residency cards.
There shall be no renewal of local residency cards. Upon expiration of a local residency
card, it shall be necessary for the cardholder to apply for a new card.
§ 85-7. Fees.
The Village Board shall set by resolution such application fees for local residency cards
as it may find appropriate, and such fees shall be listed in the Village's Schedule of Fees.
Such fees shall be nonrefundable.
§ 85-8. Appeals.
§ 85-9. Penalties for counterfeit or fraudulent use of cards.
A. In the event that the Village Clerk denies an application for a local residency card,
the applicant may appeal to the Village Board of Trustees.
B. Appeals may be taken by submitting, within 30 days of issuance of a written denial
by the Village Clerk's office, a letter to the Village Board stating that the applicant
wishes to appeal from the denial of the application for a local residency card, along
with a copy of the Clerk's written denial.
C. The Village Board shall schedule and hold a hearing on an appeal within 60 days of
receipt of an appeal; provided, however, that the Village Board may extend the time
in which to hold the hearing should circumstances require such an extension.

(1) Legislative intent. It is the intent of the Village of Warwick, as an exercise of
its police power, to promote the general health, safety and welfare of the
residents and inhabitants of the Village by enacting this subsection, since it is
the finding of the Board of Trustees that the possession of open containers of
alcoholic beverages by persons on certain public lands, except under
controlled conditions, is detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the
residents of the Village in that such possession contributes to the development
of unsanitary conditions and the creation of nuisances, including but not
limited to littering and raucous or other disorderly behavior. It is further the
intent of the Board of Trustees that this subsection not be considered as a
traffic regulation insofar as it relates to motor vehicles or the operation thereof.
(2) Definitions. For the purpose of this subsection, the following terms shall have
the meanings ascribed to them. All other words shall have the meanings
normally ascribed to them in regular usage.

cider and every liquid or solid, patented or not, containing alcohol, spirits,
§ 90-3 PEACE AND GOOD ORDER § 93-1
93:1
wine or beer and capable of being consumed by a human being.
CONTAINER — Any bottle, can, glass or other receptacle suitable for, or
used to hold, any liquid.
PARKING LOT — Any area or areas of private property in connection with
premises having one or more stores or business establishments and used by
the public as a means of access to and egress from such stores or business
establishments and for the parking of motor vehicles of customers and patrons
of such stores and business establishments.
PUBLIC LANDS — Any public highway, private road open to public motor
vehicle traffic, parking areas of shopping centers, hospitals and banks and any
other parking lot, street, sidewalks or playground.
VILLAGE — The Village of Warwick.
(3) Prohibition. It shall be a violation of this subsection for any person to:
(a) Consume any alcoholic beverage on any public land within the Village.
(b) Have in his possession any open container containing any alcoholic
beverage on any public lands within the Village.
(c) Have within his possession for the purpose of consumption on public
lands by either himself or another person any open container containing
an alcoholic beverage on any public lands within the Village.
(4) Exceptions.
(a) The foregoing prohibitions shall not apply to Memorial Park in the event
of a fair, picnic or other community gathering for which special
permission has been granted by the Village.
(b) The foregoing prohibitions shall not apply to the transportation of an
unsealed but not open container across public lands of the Village from
one point to another with no intent to consume the contents of such open
container while upon public lands.
(5) Application. This subsection shall apply to all persons on public lands in the
Village, except as provided in Subsection E(4) above, and shall not apply to
any person drinking an alcoholic beverage while operating a motor vehicle
upon any public highway within the Village in violation of § 1227 of the
Vehicle and Traffic Law of the State of New York.
(6) Penalties. Each violation of this subsection shall be punishable by a fine not
exceeding $250 for each offense. A violation of this subsection shall constitute
disorderly conduct, and any person violating the same shall be declared a
disorderly person.
F. The repair of motor vehicles on any street, parking lot, park or other public lands,
except in an emergency. [Added 10-14-1986 by L.L. No. 7-1986]
G. Trespass. A person is guilty of trespass when he or she knowingly enters or remains
unlawfully in or upon premises. [Added 8-1-2011 by L.L. No. 2-2011]
§ 93-1 WARWICK CODE § 93-1
93:2
(1) "Premises" includes the term "building," as defined herein, and any real
property owned by the Village of Warwick or located in the Village of
Warwick.
(2) "Building," in addition to its ordinary meaning includes any structure, vehicle
or watercraft used for overnight lodging or persons, or used by persons for
carrying on business therein, or used as an elementary or secondary school, or
an enclosed motor truck, or an enclosed motor truck trailer. Where a building
consists of two or more units separately secured or occupied, each unit shall
be deemed both a separate building in itself and a part of the main building.
(3) "Dwelling" means a building which is usually occupied by a person lodging
therein at night.
(4) "Night" means the period between 30 minutes after sunset and 30 minutes
before sunrise.
(5) "Enter or remain unlawfully." A person "enters or remains unlawfully" in or
upon premises when he is not licensed or privileged to do so. A person who,
regardless of his intent, enters or remains in or upon premises which are at the
time open to the public does so with license and privilege unless he defies a
lawful order not to enter or remain, personally communicated to him by the
owner of such premises or other authorized person. A license or privilege to
enter or remain in a building which is only partly open to the public is not a
license or privilege to enter or remain in that part of the building which is not
open to the public. A person who enters or remains upon unimproved and
apparently unused land, which is neither fenced nor otherwise enclosed in a
manner designed to exclude intruders, does so with license and privilege
unless notice against trespass is personally communicated to him by the owner
of such land or other authorized person or unless such notice is given by
posting in a conspicuous manner. A person who enters or remains in or about
a public building without written permission from someone authorized to issue
such permission or without a legitimate reason which includes a relationship
involving custody of or responsibility for a pupil or student enrolled in the
school or without legitimate business or a purpose relating to the operation of
the school does so without license and privilege. A person who enters or
remains in or about property owned by the Village without written permission
from someone authorized to issue such permission or without a legitimate
reason which includes the property being open to the public, or in the course
of employment, or the lands not posted or without legitimate business or a
purpose relating to the operation of the facility on the premises, does so
without license and privilege.
H. Disorderly conduct. A person is guilty of disorderly conduct when, with intent to
cause public inconvenience, breach of peace, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly
creating a risk thereof: [Added 8-1-2011 by L.L. No. 2-2011]
(1) He engages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior; or
(2) He makes unreasonable noise; or
(3) In a public place, he uses abusive or obscene language or makes an obscene
§ 93-1 PEACE AND GOOD ORDER § 93-1
93:3
gesture; or
(4) Without lawful authority, he disturbs any lawful assembly or meeting of
persons; or
(5) He obstructs vehicular or pedestrian traffic; or
(6) He congregates with other persons in a public place and refuses to comply with
a lawful order of the police to disperse; or
(7) He creates a hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act which
serves no legitimate purpose.
I. Mischief. A person is guilty of mischief when, having no right to do so nor any
reasonable ground to do so or has such right, he or she: [Added 8-1-2011 by L.L.
No. 2-2011]
(1) Intentionally damages property of another person or entity; or
(2) Intentionally participates in the destruction of an abandoned building as
defined in § 1971-a of the Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law; or
(3) Recklessly damages property of another person or entity.
(4) Tampers with property of another person with intent to cause substantial
inconvenience to such person or to a third person or entity.
(5) Damages any real or personal property maintained as a cemetery plot, grave,
burial place or other place of interment of human remains located within the
Village; or
(6) Recklessly engages in conduct which creates a substantial risk of damage to
the property of another person or entity.
(7) Posts, paints or otherwise affixes to the property of another person any
advertisement, poster, notice or other matter designed to benefit a person other
than the owner of that property. Where such matter consists of a commercial
advertisement, it shall be presumed that the vendor of the specified product,
service or entertainment is a person who placed such advertisement or caused

repair of sidewalks, curbs and gutters; or removal of snow, ice or debris from sidewalks;
or removal of roots from under sidewalks by adjoining landowners.

construct or repair, wholly or partly at his expense, sidewalks, curbs and gutters
adjoining said owner's land, or to remove snow, ice or debris from sidewalks adjoining
said owner's land or to remove roots from under sidewalks adjoining said owner's lands.
The Superintendent of Public Works shall also have the power to prescribe the manner
of doing such work and the kind of materials to be used therein.

to be removed from a sidewalk or roots removed from under sidewalks, wholly at
the expense of the owner of the adjoining land, a written notice shall be served upon
the owner demanding that such work be completed by the owner within 10 days
from the date of said notice. If the owner shall fail to properly complete said work
within said 10 days, the Superintendent of Public Works may cause the same to be
so constructed, repaired or removed, and the cost thereof shall be assessed by the
Board of Trustees upon the adjoining land in the same manner as other special

removed, and the Board of Trustees shall assess the cost upon the adjoining land for the
proportion of the expense chargeable against the same, in the manner and at the same
time as other special assessments of the village are assessed upon landowners.

All grading done on sidewalks, curbs and gutters laid or repaired by the owner of
adjoining land shall be in accordance with the specifications adopted by and under the
direction and supervision of the Superintendent of Public Works.

address as set forth in the latest completed assessment roll of the Village of Warwick,
and may be delivered personally, by telegram or by certified mail.
§ 117-28. Penalties for offenses. [Amended 6-14-1976 by L.L. No. 7-1976]
Any person committing an offense against any provision of this part shall, in addition
to the assessment as provided in §§ 117-24 and 117-25 above, be guilty of a violation
punishable by a fine not exceeding $250 or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding 15
days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. The continuation of an offense against the

§ 120-1. Declaration of policy; title.
By the authority of the resolution of the Board of Trustees of the Village of Warwick,
previously adopted pursuant to the provisions of Article VI-A of the Village Law of the
State of New York, constituting Chapter 64 of the Consolidated Laws,17 the Planning
Board of the Village of Warwick was authorized and empowered to approve plats, with
or without streets, for subdivisions within the Village of Warwick. It is declared to be
the policy of the Warwick Planning Board to consider land subdivision plats as part of
a plan for the orderly, efficient and economical development of the Village. This means,
among other things, that land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be
used safely for building purposes without danger to health or peril from fire, flood or
other menace, that proper provision shall be made for drainage, water supply, sewerage
and other needed improvements; that all proposed lots shall be so laid out and of such
size as to be in harmony with the development pattern of the neighboring properties;
that the proposed streets shall compose a convenient system conforming to the Official
Map, if such exists, shall be properly related to the proposals shown on the Master Plan,
if such exists, and shall be of such width, grade and location as to accommodate the
prospective traffic, to afford adequate light and air, to facilitate fire protection and to
provide access of fire-fighting equipment to buildings; and that proper provision shall
be made for open spaces for parks and playgrounds. In order that land subdivisions may
be made in accordance with this policy, these regulations, which shall be known as, and
which may be cited as, the "Village of Warwick Land Subdivision Regulations," have
been adopted by the Planning Board on November 16, 1964, and approved by the Village

Warwick, with the exception of the asphaltic concrete wearing course. The
wearing course shall be bonded, and this work shall be done before
certificates of occupancy are issued.
The two model homes are not to be sold until all improvements are
completed. No certificates of occupancy shall be issued for any of the
buildings until all the public improvements are completed and accepted for
dedication by the Village Board."
A. Improvements and performance bond. Before the Board grants final approval of the
subdivision plat, the subdivider shall follow the procedure set forth in either
Subsection A(1) or Subsection A(2) below.
(1) Bonds and improvements.
(a) In an amount set by the Planning Board the subdivider shall either file
with the Village Clerk a certified check to cover the full cost of the
required improvements, or the subdivider shall file with the Village Clerk
a performance bond to cover the full cost of the required improvements.
Any such bond shall comply with the requirements of § 179-1 of the
Village Law25 and shall be satisfactory to the Village Engineer as to
form, sufficiency, manner of execution and surety. A period of one year,
or such other period as the Planning Board may determine appropriate,
not to exceed three years, shall be set forth in the bond within which
required improvements must be completed. If the bond is not filed within
45 days of the approval granted in § 120-7F above, the plat shall be
deemed disapproved.
(b) With respect to any dwelling fronting on a new street shown on the
subdivision plat, all required improvements shall be completed to the
24. Editor's Note: Former Subsection F. Action on proposed subdivision plat, was repealed 6-7-2004 by L.L. No. 4-2004.

§ 120-7 WARWICK CODE § 120-8
120:16
satisfaction of the Village Engineer within four months after the date of
initial title transfer. If the subdivider fails to do so, the Board of Trustees
may order such improvements to be installed and charge the expense
thereof to the subdivider. In the case of exceptionally large subdivisions,
the Planning Board may grant a reasonable extension of time beyond the
said four-month period or, alternately, may approve the completion of
only a portion of the required improvements within the period specified.
No bond shall be released except upon certification by the Board of
Trustees that all required improvements have been completed to their
satisfaction.
(2) Completion of improvements. The subdivider shall complete all required
improvements to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer, who shall file with
the Planning Board a letter signifying the satisfactory completion of all
improvements required by the Board. For any required improvements not so
completed there shall be submitted to the Board of Trustees a bond or certified
check covering the costs of all improvements not completed and the cost of
satisfactorily installing any improvement not approved by the Village
Engineer. Any such bond shall be satisfactory to the Board of Trustees and the
Village Engineer as to form, sufficiency, manner of execution and surety.
(3) Regardless of whether the procedure in Subsection A(1) or Subsection A(2) of
this section is followed, the following also shall be required.
(a) The subdivider shall file with the village a certified check or surety bond
in the amount determined by the Planning Board to be adequate to assure
the satisfactory condition of the initial improvements for a period of one
year following their completion. Any such bond shall be satisfactory to
the Board of Trustees and Village Engineer as to form, sufficiency,
manner of execution and surety.
(b) The subdivider shall be required to provide contingent public liability
insurance in the name of the village at the same limits as the general
liability policy of the village. This insurance shall apply to general
liability and property damage coverage.
(c) Review fees. The subdivider shall file with the village a certified check,
calculated upon the following schedule, for review of plans of
developments at both preliminary and final submission stages. Said
review fee will be paid with an application for preliminary approval, will
be nonrefundable and will allow for a thorough review of the plans prior
to construction. [Added 1-10-1977 by L.L. No. 1-1977]
[1] Inspection fees. The applicant shall pay to the village, prior to the
inspection, an amount equal to 5% of the cost of the proposed
improvements as estimated by the Village Engineer, as a retainer. If
the actual cost of inspection exceeds 5%, the difference shall be paid
by the applicant. [Amended 11-8-198226]
[2] Commercial site plan review fees shall be as set forth in Chapter 63,

120:17
Fees. [Amended 11-8-198227]
B. Waiver of required improvements. The Planning Board may waive, for such period
as it may determine, the provision of any or all such improvements as, in its
judgment, are not necessary in the interests of the public health, safety and general
welfare. In the case of each waiver granted, the Planning Board shall enter upon its
records the reason or reasons why the particular improvement is not necessary, and
it shall attach appropriate conditions or require such guaranties as may be necessary
to protect the public interest.
C. Modification of design of improvements. If at any time before or during the
construction of the required improvements it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the Village Engineer that unforeseen conditions made it necessary or preferable to
modify the location or design of such required improvements, the Village Engineer
may, upon his own initiative or upon written request of the subdivider, authorize
modifications, provided these modifications are within the spirit and intent of the
Planning Board's approval and do not extend to the waiver or substantial alteration
of the function of any improvements required by the Board. The Village Engineer
shall issue any authorization under this section in writing and shall transmit a copy
of such authorization to the Planning Board at its next regular meeting.
D. Inspection of improvements. The Board of Trustees shall cause inspection to be
made to assure that all Village specifications and requirements shall be met during
the construction of required improvements and to assure the satisfactory completion
of improvements and utilities required by the Planning Board.
(1) The applicant may elect to install such improvements in accordance with the
approved preliminary layout if he notifies the Board of Trustees in writing of
his intentions to proceed. If he does not so notify the Board of Trustees, he
shall proceed at his own risk. Upon receipt of a written request to proceed, the
Board of Trustees shall assign an Inspector. The applicant shall pay to the
Village, prior to the inspection, an amount equal to 3% of the cost of the
proposed improvements as estimated by the Village Engineer or the actual cost
of inspection, whichever is less.
(2) If a bond is to be given to assure completion of required improvements, the
Board of Trustees shall assign an Inspector to assure such satisfactory
completion. The developer shall pay the Board of Trustees, prior to their
approval of the bond, an amount equal to 3% of the amount of the bond to
cover the cost of such inspection.
E. Utilities required. As to utilities required by the Planning Board, the Planning Board
may accept assurance from each public utility company whose facilities are
proposed to be installed. Such assurance shall be given in a letter addressed to the
Board and stating that such public utility company will make the installations
necessary for the furnishing of its services within the time therein specified and
satisfactory to the Board.
F. Proper installation of improvements. If the Village Engineer shall find, upon
inspection of the improvements performed before the expiration date of the

§ 120-10. Public streets; recreation areas.
performance bond, that any of the required improvements have not been
constructed in accordance with plans and specifications filed by the subdivider, he
shall so report to the Board of Trustees, Building Inspector and Planning Board.
The Planning Board then shall notify the subdivider and, if necessary, the bonding
company, and take all necessary steps to preserve the Village's rights under the
bond. No plat shall be approved by the Planning Board as long as the subdivider is
in default on a previously approved plat.
A. Final approval and filing.28 Upon completion of the requirements in § 120-8 above
and notation to that effect upon the subdivision plat, it shall be deemed to have final
approval and shall be properly signed by the appropriate officers of the Planning
Board, Chairman or Acting Chairman, and shall be filed by the applicant in the
office of the County Clerk. Any subdivision plat not so filed or recorded within 60
days of the date upon which such plat is approved, or considered approved by
reasons of the failure of the Planning Board to act, shall become null and void,
unless the particular circumstances of said applicant warrant the Planning Board to
grant an extension. [Amended 6-7-2004 by L.L. No. 4-2004]
B. Plat void if revised after approval. No changes, erasures, modifications or revisions
shall be made in any subdivision plat after approval has been given by the Planning
Board and endorsed in writing on the plat, unless the said plat is first resubmitted to
the Planning Board and such Board approves any modifications. In the event that
any such subdivision plat is recorded without complying with this requirement, the
same shall be considered null and void, and the Board shall institute proceedings to
have the plat stricken from the records of the County Clerk.
A. Public acceptance of streets. The approval by the Planning Board of a subdivision
plat shall not be deemed to constitute or be evidence of any acceptance by the
village of any street, easement, park, playground or other open space shown on such
subdivision plat.
B. Ownership and maintenance of recreation areas. When a park, playground or other
recreation area shall have been shown on a plat, the approval of said plat shall not
constitute an acceptance by the village of such area. The Planning Board shall
require the plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect. The Planning
Board may also require the filing of a written agreement between the applicant and
the Board of Trustees covering future deed and title, dedication and provision for
the cost of grading, development, equipment and maintenance of any such
recreation area.

ARTICLE III
General Requirements and Design Standards
§ 120-11. Interpretation of standards.
In considering applications for subdivision of land, the Planning Board shall be guided
by the standards set forth hereinafter. The said standards shall be considered to be
minimum requirements and shall be waived by the Board only under circumstances set
forth in Article V hereof.
§ 120-12. General requirements.
The following shall be general requirements for the subdivision of land:
§ 120-13. Street layout.
A. Character of land. Land to be subdivided for building purposes shall be of such a
character that it can be used safely without danger to the residents from any menace.
B. Conformity to Official Map and Master Plan. Subdivisions shall conform to the
Official Map of the village, if such exists, and shall be in harmony with the Master
Plan.
C. Specifications for required improvements. All required improvements shall
conform to the village specifications, which may be obtained from the Village
Engineer.
A. Width, location and construction. Streets shall be of sufficient width, suitably
located and adequately constructed to conform with the minimum road
specifications29 and the Master Plan, if such exists, and to accommodate the
prospective traffic and afford access for fire fighting, snow removal and other road
maintenance equipment. The arrangement of streets shall be such as to cause no
undue hardship to adjoining properties and shall be coordinated so as to compose a
convenient system.
B. Arrangement. The arrangement of streets in the subdivision shall provide for the
continuation of principal streets of adjoining subdivisions and for projection of
principal streets into adjoining properties which are not yet subdivided, in order to
make possible necessary fire protection, movement of traffic and the construction
or extension, presently or when later required, of needed utilities and public
services such as sewers, water and drainage facilities. Where, in the opinion of the
Planning Board, topographic or other conditions make such continuance
undesirable or impracticable, the above conditions may be modified.
C. Minor streets. Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will
be discouraged.
D. Special treatment along arterial streets. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an
existing or proposed arterial street, the Board may require marginal access streets,
reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the
29. Editor's Note: See Ch. A149, Minimum Specifications for Streets.
§ 120-11 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 120-13
120:21
rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys or such other treatment as
may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford
separation of through and local traffic.
E. Provision for future resubdivision. Where a tract is subdivided into lots
substantially larger than the minimum size required in the zoning district in which
a subdivision is located, the Board may require that streets and lots be laid out so as
to permit future resubdivision in accordance with the requirements contained in
these regulations.
F. Dead-end streets. The creation of dead-end or loop residential streets will be
encouraged wherever the Board finds that such type of development will not
interfere with normal traffic circulation in the area, provided that interior parks are
covered by appropriate covenants as to maintenance. In the case of dead-end streets,
the Board may require the reservation of a twenty-foot wide easement, where
needed or desirable, to provide for continuation of pedestrian traffic and utilities to
the next street. Subdivisions containing 20 lots or more shall have at least two street
connections with existing public streets, or streets shown on the Official Map, if
such exists, or streets on an approved subdivision plat for which a bond has been
filed.
G. Block size. Blocks shall not be excessively long. Blocks generally shall not be less
than 400 feet in length. In general, no block shall be less than twice the normal lot
depth in width nor more than 1,200 feet in length. In blocks exceeding 800 feet in
length, the Planning Board may require the reservation of a twenty-foot-wide
easement through the block to provide for the crossing of underground utilities and
pedestrian traffic, where needed or desirable, and may further specify, at its
discretion, that a four-foot-wide paved footpath be included. The Planning Board
shall make provisions for the proper maintenance of any such easement.
H. Intersections with major roads. Minor or secondary street openings into a major
road shall, in general, be at least 500 feet apart.
I. Street jogs with center-line offsets of less than 125 feet shall generally not be
permitted.
J. Angle of intersection. In general, all streets shall join each other so that for a
distance of at least 100 feet the street is approximately at right angles to the street it
joins.
K. Relation to topography. The street plan of a proposed subdivision shall bear a
logical relationship to the topography of the property, and all streets shall be
arranged so as to obtain as many of the building sites as possible at or above the
grade of the streets. Grades of streets shall conform as closely as possible to the
original topography.
L. Other required streets. Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad rightof-
way or limited access highway right-of-way, the Planning Board may require a
street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in
residential districts or for commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts.
Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of
§ 120-13 WARWICK CODE § 120-13
120:22
§ 120-14. Street design.
approach grades and future grade separations.
A. Widths of rights-of-way. Streets shall have the following widths. When not
indicated on the Master Plan or Official Map, if such exists, the classification of
streets shall be determined by the Board.
Streets
Minimum Right-of-
Way
(feet)
Minimum Pavement
(feet)
Major Arterial 66 54
Collector 60 48
Local 50 35
B. Improvements. Streets shall be graded and improved with pavements, curbs and
gutters, sidewalks, drainage facilities, water mains, sewers, street lights and signs,
street trees and fire hydrants, except where waivers may be requested. The Planning
Board may waive, subject to appropriate conditions, such improvements as it
considers may be omitted without jeopardy to the public health and safety and
general welfare. Pedestrian easements shall be improved as required by the Village
Engineer. Such grading and improvements shall be approved as to design and
specifications by the Village Engineer.
(1) Fire hydrants. Installation of fire hydrants shall be in conformity with all
requirements of standard thread and nut as specified by the New York Fire
Insurance Rating Organization and the Bureau for Fire of the Division of
Safety30 of the State of New York.
(2) Streetlighting facilities. Lighting facilities shall be in conformance with the
lighting system of the village. Such lighting standards and fixtures shall be
installed after approval by the appropriate power company and the authorized
Village Electrical Inspector.
C. Utilities in streets. The Planning Board may require that underground utilities be
placed in the street right-of-way between the paved roadway and street line to
simplify location and repair of lines when they require attention. The subdivider
shall install underground service connections to the property line of each lot within
the subdivision for such required utilities before the street is paved.
D. Utility easements. Where topography is such as to make impractical the inclusion
of utilities within the street rights-of-way, perpetual unobstructed easements at least
20 feet in width shall be otherwise provided with satisfactory access to the street.
Wherever possible, easements shall be continuous from block to block and shall
present as few irregularities as possible. Such easements shall be cleared and graded
where required.
E. Grades. Grades of all streets shall conform in general to the terrain and shall not be
30. Editor's Note: Now the Division of Fire Safety of the Office of Local Government of the Executive Department.
§ 120-13 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 120-14
120:23
less than 1/2 of 1% nor more than 6% for major or collector streets, or 10% for
minor streets in residential zones, but in no case more than 3% within 50 feet of any
intersection.
F. Changes in grade. All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical curves of
such length and radius as meet with the approval of the Village Engineer so that
clear visibility shall be provided for a safe distance.
G. Curve radii at street intersections. All street right-of-way lines at intersections shall
be rounded by curves of at least 20 feet in radius and curbs shall be adjusted
accordingly.
H. Steep grades and curves; visibility of intersections. A combination of steep grades
and curves shall be avoided. In order to provide visibility for traffic safety, that
portion of any corner lot, whether at an intersection entirely within the subdivision
or at an intersection of a new street with an existing street, which is shown shaded
on Sketch No. 1 shall be cleared of all growth, except isolated trees, and
obstructions above the level three feet higher than the center line of the street. If the
Planning Board so directs, ground shall be excavated to achieve visibility.
I. Dead-end streets. Where dead-end streets are designed to be so permanently, they
should in general not exceed 400 feet in length and shall terminate in a circular
turnaround having a minimum right-of-way radius of 50 feet and pavement radius
of 40 feet. At the end of temporary dead-end streets a temporary turnaround with a
pavement radius of 40 feet shall be provided, unless the Planning Board approves
an alternate arrangement.
J. Watercourses.
(1) Where a watercourse separates a proposed street from abutting property,
provision shall be made for access to all lots by means of culverts or other
structures of design approved by the Village Engineer.
(2) Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or
stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-ofway
as required by the Village Engineer, and in no case less than 20 feet in
width.
K. Curve radii. In general, street lines within a block deflecting from each other at any
§ 120-14 WARWICK CODE § 120-14
120:24
§ 120-15. Street names.
§ 120-16. Lots.
one point by more than 10° shall be connected with a curve, the radius of which
for the inner street lines shall not be less than 350 feet on major streets, 250 feet
on collector streets and 100 feet on minor streets. The outer street line in each case
shall be parallel to such inner street line.
L. Service streets or loading space in commercial developments. Paved rear service
streets of not less than 20 feet in width or, in lieu thereof, adequate off-street loading
space, suitably surfaced, shall be provided in connection with lots designed for
commercial use.
M. Free flow of vehicular traffic abutting commercial developments. In front of areas
zoned and designed for commercial use, or where a change of zoning to a zone
which permits commercial use is contemplated to permit such use, the street width
shall be increased by such amount on each side as may be deemed necessary by the
Board to assure the free flow of through traffic without interference by parked or
parking vehicles and to provide adequate and safe parking space for such
commercial or business district.
A. Type of name. All streets shown on a preliminary layout or subdivision plat shall
be named and approved by the Planning Board. Streets shall have names and not
numbers or letters, such as "1st" or "A" Street.
B. Names to be substantially different. Proposed street names shall be substantially
different so as not to be confused in sound or spelling with present names, except
that streets that join or are in alignment with streets of an abutting or neighboring
property shall bear the same name.
A. Lots to be usable for construction. The lot arrangement shall be such that in
constructing a building in compliance with the Zoning Ordinance31 there will be no
foreseeable difficulties for reasons of topography or other natural conditions. Lots
shall not be of such depth as to encourage the later creation of a second building lot
at the front or rear.
B. Side lines. All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to straight street lines and
radial to curved street lines, unless a variance from this rule will give a better street
or lot plan.
C. Corner lots. Corner lots shall be of sufficient dimensions so that any structure
placed thereon shall conform to the building setback line of each street.
D. Driveway access. Where practicable, lots shall be so laid out that the driveways
have access to that street on which they abut which carries or is intended to carry
the lesser amount of traffic. Driveway grades between the streets and the setback
line shall not exceed 10%.
E. Access from private streets. Access from private streets shall be deemed acceptable

§ 120-17. Drainage improvements.
§ 120-18. Parks, open spaces, school sites and natural features.
only if such streets are designed and improved in accordance with these regulations.
F. Monuments and lot corner markers. Permanent monuments meeting specifications
approved by the Village Engineer as to size, type and installation shall be set at such
block corners, angle points, points of curves in streets and other points as the
Village Engineer may require and their location shall be shown on the subdivision
plat.
A. Removal of spring and surface water. The subdivider may be required by the
Planning Board to carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that
may exist either previous to or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage facilities
shall be located in the street right-of-way where feasible or in perpetual
unobstructed easements of appropriate width.
B. Drainage structure to accommodate potential development upstream. A culvert or
other drainage facility shall, in each case, be large enough to accommodate
potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside
the subdivision. The Village Engineer shall approve the design and size of facility
based on anticipated runoff from a ten-year storm under conditions of total potential
development permitted by the Zoning Ordinance32 in the watershed.
C. Responsibility for drainage downstream. The subdivider's engineer shall also study
the effect of each subdivision on existing downstream drainage facilities outside the
area of the subdivision; this study shall be reviewed by the Village Engineer. Where
it is anticipated that the additional runoff incident to the development of the
subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage facility during a fiveyear
storm, the Planning Board shall notify the Board of Trustees of such potential
condition. In such case the Planning Board shall not approve the subdivision until
provision has been made for the improvement of said condition.
D. Land subject to flooding. Land subject to flooding or land deemed by the Planning
Board to be uninhabitable shall not be platted for residential occupancy nor for such
other uses as may increase danger to health, life or property or aggravate the flood
hazard, but such land within the plat shall be set aside for such uses as shall not be
endangered by periodic or occasional inundation.
A. Recreation areas and school sites shown on Village Plan. Where a proposed park,
playground, open space or school site shown on the Village Plan is located, in
whole or in part, in a subdivision, the Board shall require that such area or areas be
shown on the plat in accordance with the requirements specified in Subsection B
below. Such area or areas may be dedicated to the Village or county by the
subdivider if the Board of Trustees approves such dedication.
B. Parks and playgrounds not shown on Village Plan.
(1) The Planning Board shall require that the plat show sites of a character, extent
32. Editor's Note: See Ch. 145, Zoning.
§ 120-16 WARWICK CODE § 120-18
120:26
and location suitable for the development of a park, playground or other
recreation purpose.
(2) The Board shall require that no more than three acres of recreation space be
provided per 100 dwelling units shown on the plat; provided that in no case
shall the amount be less than 10% of the gross area of the subdivision. Such
area or areas may be dedicated to the Village or county by the subdivider if the
Board of Trustees approves such dedication.
(3) Two acres is the minimum of contiguous recreation space which shall be
acceptable to the Planning Board. In subdivisions of 20 acres or less, park and
playground areas of lesser size may be approved when the Planning Board
finds that the difference between the recreation area shown on the plat and two
acres may be made up in connection with the subdivision of adjacent land.
C. Information to be submitted. In the event that an area to be used for a park or
playground is required to be so shown, the subdivider shall submit, prior to final
approval, to the Board three prints, one on cloth, drawn in ink showing, at a scale
of not less than 30 feet to the inch, such area and the following features thereof:
(1) The boundaries of the said area, giving lengths and bearings of all straight lines
and radii, lengths, central angles, tangent distances and radial bearings of all
curves. All lengths shall be in feet and hundredths of a foot, and all angles shall
be given to the nearest 10 seconds. The error of closure shall not exceed
1:10,000.
(2) Existing features such as brooks, ponds, clusters of trees, rock outcrops and
structures.
(3) Existing and, if applicable, proposed changes in grades and contours of the
said area and of the area immediately adjacent.
D. Fee in lieu of parklands. [Amended 5-1-2000 by L.L. No. 6-2000]
(1) If the Planning Board determines that a suitable site for a public park is
unavailable within the proposed plat or site plan or if the Planning Board shall
find that the Village will be better served by a payment in lieu of parkland,
then and in that event the Planning Board shall condition the final approval of
the plat or site plan upon a payment per new dwelling unit proposed within the
plat or site plan as set forth in Chapter 63, Fees.
(a) The proposed map, plan or plat shall not be finally approved or released
for filing with the County Clerk until all fees due pursuant to this section
have been paid in full.
(b) The Village Board may from time to time amend the fee to be imposed;
provided, however, that such modification shall take effect at midnight
following the annual reorganization meeting of the Board of Trustees.
Said fee shall also be reflected in the "Schedule of Fees" forming a part
of the Subdivision and Site Plan Regulations of the Village.
(2) All payments received by the Village in lieu of parklands shall be held by the
Village for the acquisition of parklands and/or for capital improvements to
§ 120-18 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 120-18
120:27
existing parks, playground or other recreational facilities within the village.
E. School sites. Upon receipt from the School Board of a letter declaring its interest in
a school site of a specific size and location within a proposed subdivision, the
Planning Board may require a subdivider to set aside such area. Upon the failure of
the proper authorities to purchase such school site within 36 months after the date
of the approval of the plat, the subdivider, upon application to the Board and
approval of such application, shall be relieved of the responsibility of showing such
land for public purposes.
F. Reserve strips prohibited. Reserve strips of land, which might be used to control
access from the proposed subdivision to any neighboring property or to any land
within the subdivision itself, shall be prohibited.
G. Preservation of natural features. The Planning Board shall, wherever possible,
establish the preservation of all natural features which add value to residential
developments and to the community, such as large trees or groves, watercourses
and falls, beaches, historic spots, vistas and similar irreplaceable assets. No tree
with a diameter of eight inches or more as measured three feet above the base of the
trunk shall be removed unless such tree is within the right-of-way of a street as
shown on the final subdivision plat. Removal of additional trees shall be subject to
the approval of the Planning Board. In no case, however, shall a tree with a diameter
of eight inches or more as measured three feet above the base of the trunk be
removed without prior approval by the Planning Board.

Where the Planning Board finds that, due to the special circumstances of a particular
plat, the provision of certain required improvements is not requisite to the interest of the

§ 121-1. Findings and purpose.
The Village Board of the Village of Warwick does hereby make the following findings
and does hereby declare the following purposes with regard to the enactment of this
chapter:
§ 121-2. Definitions.
For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
LOT—A parcel or portion of land separated from other parcels or portions, for purpose
of sale, lease or separate use by means of a description as indicated by a subdivision plat,
a recorded map or deed or by metes and bounds or separated by a public street or railroad
right-of-way. Two or more nonconforming contiguous lots under the same ownership
shall be considered as one lot whether or not this combination creates a conforming lot.
LOT LINE CHANGE — Any alteration of the lot line(s) or dimensions of any lots,
whether or not shown on a plat previously approved and filed in the Orange County
Clerk's office, which alteration will result in land area becoming part of an existing
adjacent lot, provided that no new lots are created. No lot line change shall create any
A. It is in the best interests of the People of the Village of Warwick that the Planning
Board of the Village of Warwick (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Board")
be allowed a simplified procedure for lot line change applications rather than
requiring full compliance with the subdivision rules and regulations of the Village
of Warwick.
B. A simplified procedure for lot line changes will expedite the approval process and
be less costly to the applicants.
C. A simplified procedure will expedite the business of the Planning Board and be no
less protective of the interests of the public in such applications.
D. Therefore, it is the finding of the Village of Warwick Village Board that, in order
to protect and safeguard the Village of Warwick, its residents, property owners and
property and to promote the general health, safety and welfare, the Village amend
its current legislation to provide for an alternative to its subdivision rules and
regulations to allow for lot line change applications, procedure, rules, and
determinations.
E. From these foregoing findings, it is the determination of the Village Board that
there is a need for the amendments set forth in this chapter.
§ 120-25 LOT LINE CHANGES § 121-2
121:1

applicable provisions of the Village Law of the State of New York. If an application
for the alteration of lot lines or dimensions meets the definition of "lot line change" as
set forth in this chapter, the Planning Board may determine that the application does
not require subdivision approval. The Planning Board is hereby authorized upon such
determination to direct the Planning Board Chairperson to sign lot line change plats
subject to such conditions and requirements as the Planning Board deems necessary.
No alteration of lot lines or dimensions shall be made without the submission of an
application and the review of the Planning Board as provided herein. If a proposed

The Planning Board shall review any previously approved site plans for the subject
parcels and applicable conditions of approval and supplementary regulations and shall
determine if a new site plan approval, or amended site plan approval, if required under

special permit, if required under the Zoning Code for a continuing or proposed use, is
required. The applicant shall be so notified in writing.
§ 121-15. Prior variances.
A lot line change may or may not invalidate a previously approved variance for one
of the lots. If a variance exists for one of the lots, the Planning Board shall refer the
application to the Code Enforcement Officer, if there be such, and, if not, then to the
Building Inspector for the Village, for a determination on whether the variance will be
invalidated by an approval of the lot line application. If that be the determination and the
lot line plat be thereafter filed, such a variance shall be thereupon nullified, voided, and
of no further effect. Nothing herein shall preclude a reapplication to the Zoning Board of

and owner(s) and then by the Chairperson of the Planning Board. The lot line change plat
may then be filed by the applicant in the Office of the Orange County Clerk, together

applicant shall provide the Planning Board with two copies of the lot line change plat
certified by Office of the Orange County Clerk, together with the liber and page of
the recorded deeds implementing the contemplated transfer. No building permit shall
be issued until such certified copies of the plat and the deed recording information are
received by the Village of Warwick. Planning Board approval of a lot line change plat
shall not be deemed an acceptance by the Village of any road, or other land, shown as
offered for cession to public use and ownership.
§ 121-18. Plat void if revised after approval.
No changes, erasures, modifications, or revisions shall be made on any lot line change
plat after approval has been given by the Planning Board. In the event that any lot line
change plat, when recorded, contains any such changes, the plat shall be considered
null and void, and the Planning Board shall institute proceedings to have said plat
stricken from the records of the County Clerk and Village Clerk, and the costs of such a

added to the ad valorem taxes due on the parcels and collected as part of the real property
tax levy affected by the then filed plat.
§ 121-19. Expiration of approval.
The approval of a lot line change shall expire 62 days after the signing of the plat by
the Chairperson of the Planning Board unless filing of the lot line plat is accomplished
within that time period in the Office of the Orange County Clerk. The expiration of an
approval shall render any prior determination null and void, and any resubmission shall
require full compliance with this chapter.
§ 121-20. Default approval.
The Planning Board shall be deemed to have approved an application for a lot line
change by indication of such approval upon the lot line change plat and by filing of its
decision in the office of the Village Clerk. The Planning Board shall be bound by the
same default timetable and procedure with respect to lot line changes as it is subject to
with respect to subdivisions under New York State Village Law § 7-728 or successor
legislation.

Every utility subject to tax under this article shall keep such records of its business and
in such form as the Village Treasurer may require or as the Village Board may require,

124:12
Treasurer, in order to ensure payment of the tax imposed, may require at any time a
further or supplemental return, which shall contain any data that may be specified by her,

an affidavit of the head of the utility making the same, or of the owner or copartner
thereof, or of a principal officer of the corporation, if such business is conducted by a
corporation, to the effect that the statements contained therein are true.
§ 124-12. Payment of tax.
At the time of filing a return as required by this article each utility shall pay to the Village
of Warwick the tax imposed by this article for the period covered by such return. Such

due, on the last day on which the return is required to be filed.
§ 124-13. Insufficient or unsatisfactory returns; limitation on additional
assessment.
A. In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or unsatisfactory
to the Village Treasurer, and if a corrected or sufficient return is not filed within 20
days after the same is required by notice from him, or if no return is made for any
period, the Village Treasurer shall determine the amount of tax due from such
information as she is able to obtain and, if necessary, may estimate the tax on the
basis of external indices or otherwise. She shall give notice of such determination
to the person liable for such tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably
fix such tax, unless the person against whom it is assessed shall, within 30 days
after the giving of notice of such determination, apply to the Village Treasurer for
a hearing, or unless the Village Treasurer, of her own motion, shall reduce the same.
After such hearing, the Village Treasurer shall give notice of her decision to the
person liable to the tax. Such decision may be reviewed by a proceeding under
Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the State of New York if
application therefor is made within 90 days after the giving of notice of such
decision. An order to review such decision shall not be granted unless the amount
of any tax sought to be reviewed, with interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall
be first deposited with the Village Treasurer and an undertaking filed with her, in
such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve
to the effect that, if such proceedings be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the
applicant will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such
proceeding, or at the option of the application, such undertaking may be in a sum
sufficient to cover the tax, interest, penalties, costs and charges aforesaid in which
event, the applicant shall not be required to pay such tax, interest and penalties as a
condition precedent to the granting of such order.
B. Except in the case of willfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax,
no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of more than three
years from the date of the filing; provided, however, that where no return has been
filed as required by this article, the tax may be assessed at any time.

124:13
§ 124-14. Service of notice.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may be given
by mailing the same to the persons for whom it is intended, in a postpaid envelope,
addressed to such person at the address given by him in the last return filed by him under
this article or, if no return has been filed, then to such address as may be obtainable.
The mailing of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by
the person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the
provisions of this article by the giving of notice shall commence to run from the date of
mailing of such notice.
§ 124-15. Failure to file return or pay tax.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return or to pay any tax or any portion
thereof within the time required by this article shall be subject to a penalty of 5% of
the amount of tax due, plus 1% of such tax for each month of delay or fraction thereof,
excepting the first month, after such return was required to be filed or such tax became
due, but the Village Treasurer, for cause shown, may extend the time for filing any
return, and if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any portion of the
penalty fixed by the foregoing provisions of this section.
§ 124-16. Refunds.
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer thereof shall make
application for a refund thereof and the Village Treasurer or the court shall determine
that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof was erroneously or illegally collected,
the Village Treasurer shall refund the amount so determined. For like cause and within
the same period, a refund may be so made on the initiative of the Village Treasurer.
However, no refund shall be made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination
of the Village Treasurer as hereinbefore provided unless the Village Treasurer, after a
hearing as hereinbefore provided or if by her own motion, shall have reduced the tax or
penalty or if it shall have been established in a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil
Practice Law and Rules of the State of New York that such determination was erroneous
or illegal. All refunds shall be made out of moneys collected under this article. An
application for a refund, made as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an application
for the revision of any tax or penalty complained of, and the Village Treasurer may
receive additional evidence with respect thereto. After making her determination, the
Village Treasurer shall give notice thereof to the person interested, and she shall be
entitled to an order to review such determination under said Article 78 of the Civil
Practice Law and Rules of the State of New York, subject to the provision hereinbefore
contained relating to the granting of such an order.
§ 124-17. Tax to constitute part of operating costs of utility.
The tax imposed by this article shall be charged against and be paid by the utility and
shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by the utility to customers or others
but shall constitute a part of the operating costs of such utility.
§ 124-18. Action to enforce payment; tax and penalty to constitute lien.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this article, the
§ 124-14 WARWICK CODE § 124-18
124:14
Village Attorney shall, upon the request of the Village Board, bring an action to enforce
payment of same. The proceeds of any judgment obtained in any such action shall be
paid to the Village Treasurer. Each such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property
of the person liable to pay the same, in the same manner and to the same extent that the
tax and penalty imposed by § 186-a of the Tax Law is made a lien.
§ 124-19. Treasurer empowered to make rules and regulations.
In the administration of this article, the Village Treasurer shall have power to make such
reasonable rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law, as may be necessary for the
exercise of her powers and the performance of her duties, and to prescribe the form of
blanks, reports and other records relating to the administration and enforcement of the
tax, to take testimony and proofs, under oath, with reference to any matter within the
line of her official duty under this article, and to subpoena and require the attendance of
witnesses and the productions of books, papers and documents.
§ 124-20. Disposition of taxes and penalties.
All taxes and penalties received by the Village Treasurer under this article shall be paid
into the treasury of the Village of Warwick, New York and shall be credited to and
deposited in the general fund of the village.38

Subdivision of land — See Ch. 120.
Zoning — See Ch. 145.
§ 131-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Tree Law of the Village of Warwick."
§ 131-2. Legislative intent.
The Village of Warwick hereby finds that indiscriminate and excessive removal of trees
by physical or chemical means from tracts of land has resulted in creating increased
surface drainage and soil erosion, thereby causing increased municipal costs for proper
drainage control, impairing the benefits of occupancy of existing residential property
in such areas and further impairing the stability and value of both improved and
unimproved real property in such areas and concomitantly adversely affecting the health,
safety and general welfare of the inhabitants of the village.
§ 131-3. Scope.
This chapter shall apply to all timbering operations; all persons and corporations who are
or will be applying for building permits in residential zones, subdivisions, commercial
zones or for industrial construction; and all persons or firms, whether or not intending to
apply for a building permit, with respect to property in commercial or industrial zoning
districts or with respect to property in residential districts which is large enough to permit
any subdivision pursuant to the Zoning Ordinance.39 School districts and federal and
local governments are exempt.
§ 131-4. Tree removal plan to accompany building permit application.
No building permit shall be issued unless such person or corporation shows on an
appropriate plan all proposed tree removals in relation to the survey stakes marking out
a building foundation, garage, driveway, recreation area or any site that warrants tree
removal. The species and condition of trees shall be reported to the Building Inspector
of the Village of Warwick.
§ 131-5. Removal of trees restricted.
A. No live tree exceeding four inches in diameter shall be removed, except under the
following circumstances:

§ 131-6. Appeals.
Any person aggrieved by the provisions of this chapter shall have the right within 20
days from the decision of the Building Inspector to appeal to the Zoning Board of
Appeals, which shall review the decision of the Building Inspector. Unless the decision
is revoked or modified, it shall remain in full force and effect.
§ 131-7. Planting of trees along right-of-way required; waiver.
Any person who obtains final subdivision approval from the Planning Board of the
Village of Warwick, County of Orange, State of New York, shall plant shade trees on
the property on which such construction is located. Such trees are to be planted within
five feet of the right-of-way of the road or roads abutting said property. One tree shall
be planted for every 40 feet of frontage of said property unless the Superintendent of
Public Works or his agent shall grant a waiver of such planting, which waiver shall be in
writing.
§ 131-8. Conditions for granting of waivers.
The Superintendent of Public Works or his agent shall grant such waiver only if there
are trees growing along such right-of-way or on the abutting property near the street
property line which in the opinion of the Superintendent of Public Works comply with
the intent of this chapter.
§ 131-9. Approval of new trees required; planting rules and regulations.
New trees provided pursuant to this chapter shall be approved by the Superintendent of
Public Works or his agent, and shall be planted in accordance with specifications, rules
and regulations promulgated by the office of the Superintendent of Public Works. The
Superintendent of Public Works is hereby authorized to promulgate such specifications,
(1) If its presence would cause hardship or endanger the public or an adjoining
property owner.
(2) In areas to be occupied by buildings, driveways or recreation areas, and within
a distance of 15 feet around the perimeter of such building, depending on tree
species and conditions to be determined by the Building Inspector.
(3) In areas having excessive cut or fill of land deemed inimical to tree survival as
evaluated by the Building Inspector.
(4) In areas where selective thinning and timbering of trees would encourage the
development of prime specimen trees. The selection of trees to be preserved
shall be based on the recommendation of the Building Inspector.
B. Trees removed pursuant to Subsection A(4) above shall be replaced on any lot from
which they are removed as the Building Inspector shall require. In no event shall a
building permit be issued on any lot or parcel unless provision shall be made for at
least four trees, of which 50% of said trees shall be evergreens.
C. For purposes of this section, the diameter of a tree shall be measured at a height of
six feet above the surface of the ground at the base of the trunk.

In lieu of planting trees in accordance with this chapter, a person may deposit with the
Superintendent of Public Works, in cash or by good certified check, such sum per tree
as the Board of Trustees may establish from time to time, by resolution to be filed with
the Village Clerk, which moneys shall be held by the Village of Warwick to be used for
the sole purpose of planting and maintaining shade trees as required by this chapter. No
street, after the effective date of this chapter, shall be accepted for dedication until the
Superintendent of Public Works shall duly inform the Board of Trustees that compliance,
where necessary, has been had with the provisions of this chapter.
§ 131-11. Requirements for larger areas.
Any person or persons obtaining a building permit from the Building Inspector of the
Village of Warwick for the construction of a commercial office, school, church or
fraternal, benevolent or industrial building whose parking space, according to the Zoning
Ordinance40 requirements, must be designed for 10 or more vehicles shall plant trees in
accordance with the rules, regulations and specifications of the Superintendent of Public
Works, prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. In lieu of the planting of these
trees, the Building Inspector may accept a waiver from the Superintendent of Public
Works or a certificate from the Superintendent of Public Works attesting to the posting
of cash or a bond stating that compliance will be had with the rules, regulations and
specifications of the Superintendent of Public Works relating to the planting of trees.
§ 131-12. Shade Tree Commission.
The Board of Trustees, by majority vote, shall appoint a three-member Shade Tree
Commission to provide for the establishment and enforcement of shade tree planting
and removal regulations of the Village of Warwick and to provide plans for the
encouragement of tree plantings with the approval of the Board of Trustees. At
inception, each Commissioner shall be appointed for staggered terms of one, two and
three years. Thereafter, the term of office shall be three years. Among the
Commissioners there shall be annually appointed one to act as Chairman. All
appointments shall be made by the Board of Trustees.
§ 131-13. Tree placement escrow account.
Any person who obtains final subdivision approval from the Village of Warwick shall
deposit in escrow with the Village Clerk in cash, certified check or by a bond a sum
equivalent to the number of trees required by the provisions of this chapter multiplied by
the sum as shall be set by the Board of Trustees in § 131-10. Said escrow is to be held
by the village for a period of one year next ensuing final completion of the subdivision

regulations of parking vehicles, said installation to be placed not more than
two feet from the curb nor more than four feet from the front line of the
parking space as indicated, and which spaces shall be marked out as individual
parking meter spaces of vehicles. Each of such meters shall be set to operate
upon the deposit therein of the appropriate fee for the period of time prescribed
as parking time limits in § 135-26A(3) of this chapter. Each of such meters
shall be so arranged as to show or display a signal, which shall clearly indicate
whether the time limit during which parking in this space is permitted has
expired.
B. Operation.
(1) Each parking meter shall operate so as to indicate that the appropriate fee has
been deposited in such meter.
(2) Each parking meter shall display a signal indicating the expiration of the time
period associated with the deposit of fees.
(3) Except in a period of emergency determined by an officer of a fire company
or of the Police Department or except in compliance with the directions of a
police officer or traffic control signal, when any vehicle shall be parked in a
space regulated by a parking meter between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 6:00
p.m. in any day except Sundays and public holidays, the owner, operator or
driver of such vehicle shall, immediately upon entering said parking space,

be unlawful for any person to cause, allow, permit or suffer any such vehicle
registered in his name to be parked overtime or remain therein beyond the parking
time limit prescribed by this chapter.
§ 135-24 VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC § 135-25.1

of 30 minutes thereafter, the fine for said second violation shall such additional amount
as shall be prescribed in the Schedule of Fees adopted by resolution of the Village Board.
In the event that a parking ticket is not answered within 15 days of issue, the scheduled
minimum fine therefor shall be doubled; in the event that such parking ticket is not
answered within 30 days, said fine shall be doubled again; in the event that said parking
ticket is not answered within 60 days, said fine shall again double and a warrant of arrest
shall be requested from the court against the violator.
§ 135-26. Deposit of fee.
A. Deposit of fee required.
(1) No person shall park a vehicle in a parking space of any parking meter zone
adjacent to a parking meter during the hours of parking meter operation unless
the appropriate fee is immediately deposited in such meter.
(2) No person shall park a vehicle in a parking space of any parking meter zone
adjacent to a parking meter during the hours of parking meter operation while
such meter is displaying a signal indicating the expiration of the time period
associated with the deposit of fees.
(3) Presumption of unlawful parking. The fact that the timing device on any
parking meter is not in operation shall be presumptive evidence as to a parked
vehicle then found in the parking space regulated by such parking meter that
the owner or driver failed to deposit or to cause to be deposited the required
coin or coins in said meter and the mechanical indication by such meter of a
"violation" shall be presumptive evidence of unlawful parking.
(4) It shall be unlawful and an offense for any person to deposit or cause to be
deposited in a parking meter any coins for the purpose of extending the
parking time beyond the total lawful parking period not to exceed three hours
in a three-hour parking meter zone and two hours in a two-hour parking meter
zone.
(5) It shall be unlawful and an offense for any person to permit a vehicle registered
in his name to remain or be placed in any parking space alongside of or next
to which any parking meter is placed while said parking meter is displaying a
signal showing that the time for which the privilege to park in such space has
been granted has expired.
(6) Vehicles shall at all times be parked parallel to the curb and wholly within the
parking meter spaces as marked, the front fender or front wheel of said vehicle
shall be as near as possible to the parking meter controlling said spaces, which
spaces shall be kept clearly marked at all times, and it shall be unlawful to park
vehicles in a way that the same shall not be wholly within the area designated
by the lines for parking for such spaces.
B. Legal currency required. No person shall deposit or attempt to deposit in any
parking meter any slugs, button or other device or substance as a substitute for coins
of United States currency.

resolution of the Village Board.

(that is, not wholly within a parking meter space as marked and partially within
an adjoining metered parking space) shall be punished by a fine in such
amount as shall be prescribed in the Schedule of Fees adopted by resolution of
the Village Board.
(3) Every person convicted of any parking violation other than overtime parking
at a meter shall be punished by a fine in such amount as shall be prescribed in

§ 136-1. Legislative intent.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Warwick hereby finds that the increased use
of ATV's throughout the Village of Warwick without any regard for the rights of the
property owners whose property is being used for the operation of those ATV's without
the permission of said landowners and without regard for the noise emanating from said
ATV's, and the dirt and dust raised up into the air by the operation of these ATV's and
the young age of the operators, has increased to such a degree that these ATV's are not
only hazardous and detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the
Village of Warwick as well as its property owners, but also to those who operate them
with no regard for their own safety or the safety of others and that regulation of the
use of ATV's within the Village will protect residents and property owners within the
Village and protect those that use ATV's within the Village. This chapter is intended
to serve the foregoing purposes by regulating and prohibiting the use of ATV's in the
Village of Warwick except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter and rules
and regulations promulgated hereunder.
§ 136-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
ATV — Any all-terrain vehicle that is motor-propelled or contains a motor to assist the
operation of said vehicle, and which vehicles are commonly referred to as "dirt bikes,"
"trail bikes," "motorized sport bikes," "go-carts," "all-terrain vehicles (ATV's)," "trikes,"
"quads," "dune buggies," et cetera, which vehicles, by their nature and design, are not
intended to be used and operated along paved roads and highways but are intended,
rather, to be operated in dirt, sand, up and down hills, along trails and in similar-type
areas.
PRIVATE PROPERTY — All land and buildings in the Village of Warwick not
included in the definition of "public property" nor part of the public road system.
PUBLIC PROPERTY — Lands and buildings owned or leased by the Village of
Warwick, any school district, the County of Orange or the State of New York or any

siphonage of contaminants through the customer's water service connection.
If, in accordance with Part 5-1.31 of the New York State Sanitary Code,
hereinafter referred to as the "code," or in the judgment of the Village or its
authorized representative, an approved backflow prevention device is
necessary for the safety of the public water supply system, notice will be given
to the water customer to install such an approved device immediately. The
water customer shall, at his own expense, install such an approved device at a
location and in a manner in accordance with the code and all applicable local
regulations and shall have inspections and tests made of such approved device
upon installation and as required by the code and this article.
(2) No person, firm or corporation shall establish or permit to be established or
maintain or permit to be maintained any connection whereby a private
auxiliary or emergency water supply other than the regular public water supply
of the Village or distribution system of said municipality may enter the supply
or distribution system of such municipality, unless such private, auxiliary or
emergency water supply and use of such supply shall have been approved by
the Village. The method of connection shall conform to the rules and
regulations of the code and shall be approved by the Village or authorized
representatives.
(3) It shall be the duty of the Village or authorized representatives to cause
surveys and investigations to be made of industrial, commercial, and other

3. Parallel to center lines: Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to the center lines or street lines of streets or the center lines or right-of-way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance there from as indicated on the Zoning Districts Map.

145-24 Warwick Village Historic District
A. Upon the enactment of this chapter and from thereafter, the Architectural and Historic District Review Board (AHDRB) shall make a study of the structures existing and situated in the Historic District and for the purpose of identifying and conserving, protecting, enhancing and perpetuating those structures within the Historic District which by reason of their particular or distinctive architectural and historical heritage, and shall recommend such structures to be designated as landmarks. Upon receipt of any such recommendation from the AHDRB, the Village Board of Trustees will schedule and conduct a public hearing, at which time the parties in interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard with respect to the proposed designation of any structure as a landmark.
B. A written notice of any proposed designation of a structure as a landmark, or any building or structure within the historic district under this section shall be given to the owner of record thereof, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the public hearing called for by this section.
C. In the event that the Village Board of Trustees shall adopt the proposed designation of a structure as a landmark, such designation shall be entered in the minutes of the Village Board of Trustees, and a copy thereof shall be published once in the official newspaper, a copy of such designation shall be posted conspicuously at or near the entrance to the office of the Village Clerk, and a copy of such designation (including all studies and reports completed by the AHDRB) shall be placed in the public library. Such designation shall take effect ten (10) days after such publication and posting. In its determination of whether such landmark qualifies by reason of its particular or distinctive architectural and historical heritage, the Village Board of Trustees shall not be bound by the confines of the Historic District. The Village Board of Trustees may also designate natural structures and other historically significant monuments and other structures within the Village but outside the Historic District. Following designation of a structure as a landmark, the Village Board of Trustees shall nominate such property to the National Register of Historic Places by preparing and filing an application for nomination to the New York State Historic Preservation Officer.
D. No building permit shall be issued by the Code Enforcement Officer for the construction, reconstruction or alteration of an historic or cultural landmark unless the application is in writing. Notwithstanding any provision of Article IX to the contrary, every application for such a building permit is subject to the issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness as described in Chapter 7 – Architectural and Historic District of the Village Code by the AHDRB and Site Plan Approval and shall be considered by the Planning Board. Failure of the Planning Board to hold a hearing or render a decision within the time periods set forth in Article IX shall not entitle the applicant to issuance of a building permit.
1. Criteria for review of a Site Plan application in the Historic District. The Planning Board's decision, in consultation with the AHDRB, shall be based on the following principles:
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 10
a. Properties which contribute to the character of the historic district shall be retained with their historic features altered as little as possible;
b. Any alteration of existing properties shall be compatible with its historic character, as well as with the surrounding district; and
c. New construction shall be compatible with the district in which it is located.
2. In applying the above-stated principles, the Planning Board shall consider the following factors:
a. The general design, character, and suitability to the property of the proposed alteration or new construction;
b. The scale of proposed alteration or new construction in relation to the property itself, surrounding properties, and the neighborhood;
c. Visual compatibility with surrounding properties
d. The importance of historic, architectural, or other features to the significance of the property.
3. Applications for Site Plan approval in the Historic District shall include all requirements per Article IX of this chapter.
145-24.1 Demolition Delay in the Historic District
A. Intent and Purpose. This section is intended to preserve and protect significant buildings which constitute or reflect distinctive features of the architectural, cultural, economic, political or social history of the Village and to limit the detrimental effects of demolition on the character of the Village. Through this section, owners of preferably preserved buildings are encouraged to seek out alternative options that will preserve, rehabilitate or restore such buildings and residents of the Village are alerted to impending demolitions of significant buildings. By preserving and protecting significant buildings, streetscapes and neighborhoods, this section promotes the public welfare by making the Village a more attractive and desirable place in which to live, work and recreate, reinforcing the uniqueness and sense of place of the Village, and enhances the desirability of the Village as a tourism destination. To achieve these purposes, the Architectural and Historic District Review Board (AHDRB) is authorized to advise the Code Enforcement Officer with respect to demolition permit applications. The issuance of demolition permits is regulated as provided by this section.
B. Procedure. No demolition permit for a building, which is in whole or in part seventy-five years or more old, shall be issued without following the provisions of this section. If a building is of unknown age, it shall be assumed that the building is over 75 years old for the purposes of this section. An applicant proposing to demolish a building subject to this section shall file with the Code Enforcement Officer an application containing the following information:
1. The 911 street address of the building to be demolished.
2. The owner's name, address and telephone number and tax parcel number.
3. A description of the building including the date of original construction (if known) and dates of significant modifications to the building.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 11
4. The reason for requesting a demolition permit.
5. A description of the proposed reuse, reconstruction or replacement sought by the applicant.
6. A photograph or photograph(s) of the building.
C. Administration. The Code Enforcement Officer shall within seven (7) days forward a copy of the application to the AHDRB. The AHDRB shall within thirty (30) days after receipt of the application or as soon thereafter that the AHDRB shall met, make a written determination of whether the building is significant. Upon determination by the AHDRB that the building is not significant, the Board shall so notify the Code Enforcement Officer and applicant in writing. The Code Enforcement Officer may then issue the demolition permit. Upon determination by the AHDRB that the building is significant, the AHDRB shall so notify the Code Enforcement Officer and the applicant in writing. No demolition permit may be issued at this time. If the AHDRB does not notify the Code Enforcement Officer within thirty (30) days of receipt of the application, the Code Enforcement Officer may proceed to issue the demolition permit. If the AHDRB finds that the building is significant, it shall hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days of the written notification to the Code Enforcement Officer.
1. The AHDRB shall decide at the public hearing or within fourteen (14) days after the public hearing whether the building should be preferably preserved. If agreed to in writing by the applicant, the determination of the AHDRB may be postponed. If the AHDRB determines that the building is not preferably preserved, the AHDRB shall so notify the Code Enforcement Officer and applicant in writing. The Code Enforcement Officer may then issue the demolition permit. If the AHDRB determines that the building is preferably preserved, the AHDRB shall notify the Code Enforcement Officer and applicant in writing. No demolition permit may then be issued for a period of twelve months from the date of the determination unless otherwise agreed to by the AHDRB. If the AHDRB does not so notify the Code Enforcement Officer in writing within thirty (30) days of the public hearing, the Code Enforcement Officer may issue the demolition permit.
2. Upon a determination by the AHDRB that any building that is the subject of an application is a preferably preserved building, the following shall apply:
a. No building permit for new construction or alterations on the premises shall be issued for a period of twelve months from the date of the determination unless otherwise agreed to by the AHDRB.
b. No permit for demolition of a building determined to be a preferably preserved building shall be granted until all plans for future use and development of the site have been filed with the Code Enforcement Officer and have been found to comply with all laws pertaining to the issuance of a building permit or if for a parking lot, a certificate of occupancy for that site.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 12
c. All approvals necessary for the issuance of such building permit or certificate of occupancy including without limitation any necessary zoning variances, special use permits, or conditional use permits, shall be granted and all appeals from the granting of such approvals shall be concluded, prior to the issuance of a demolition permit under this section.
d. The Code Enforcement Officer may issue a demolition permit or a building permit for a preferably preserved building within the twelve months if the AHDRB notifies the Code Enforcement Officer in writing that the AHDRB finds that the intent and purpose of this section is served even with the issuance of the demolition permit or the building permit. Following the twelve-month delay period, the Code Enforcement Officer may issue the demolition permit.
3. The AHDRB may prepare such rules and regulations as are necessary to administer the terms of this section, subject to approval by resolution of the Village Board of Trustees. The Schedule of Fees of the Village shall be sufficient to cover the costs associated with the administration of this section. Administrative and advertising fees shall be borne by the applicant. The AHDRB may delegate authority to make initial determinations of significance to one or more members of the AHDRB or to the Village Board of Trustees or the Code Enforcement Officer. The AHDRB may pro-actively develop a list of significant buildings that will be subject to this section. Buildings proposed for the significant building list shall be added following a public hearing.
D. Emergency Demolition. If after an inspection, the Code Enforcement Officer finds that a building subject to this section is found to pose an immediate threat to public health or safety due to its deteriorated condition and that there is no reasonable alternative to the immediate demolition of the building or structure, then the Code Enforcement Officer may issue an emergency demolition permit to the owner of the building or structure. The Code Enforcement Officer shall then prepare a report explaining the condition of the building and the basis for the decision, which shall be forwarded to the AHDRB.
E. Enforcement and Remedies. The AHDRB and/or the Code Enforcement Officer are each specifically authorized to institute any and all actions and proceedings, in law or equity, as they may deem necessary and appropriate to obtain compliance with the requirements of this section or to prevent a threatened violation thereof. Any owner of a building subject to this section that demolished the building without first obtaining a demolition permit in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be subject to a fine as specified in Section 145-149.4 of the Village Zoning Law. Each day the violation exists shall constitute a separate offense until a faithful restoration of the demolished building is completed or unless otherwise agreed to by the AHDRB. If a building subject to this section is demolished without first obtaining a demolition permit, no building permit shall be issued for a period of two years from the date of the demolition on the subject parcel of land or any adjoining parcels of land under common ownership and control unless the building permit is for the faithful restoration referred to above or unless otherwise agreed to by the AHDRB.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 13
F. New York State Historic Preservation Act. Following a determination that the building is significant and preferably preserved, the AHDRB may recommend to the Mayor and Village Board that the building be protected through the provisions of New York State Historic Preservation Act of 1980. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to conflict with the provisions of the New York State Historic Preservation Act. If any of the provisions of this section do so conflict, that Act shall prevail.
145-25 Limited Office Overlay
A. Intent. The Village Board finds that certain locations identified on the Zoning Districts Map by the Limited Office Overlay serve as transition areas between residential neighborhoods and the General Commercial and Central Business districts.

145-26 Planned Adult Community (PAC) Floating Zoning District
A. Purpose and Intent. The Planned Adult Community (PAC) District is hereby established to enable the Village of Warwick to permit Planned Unit Development intended to primarily house people fifty-five (55) years of age and older and to address the specific needs and desires of that population.

Upon approval of the application by the Village Board of Trustees, the Zoning Districts
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 15
Map is amended and the parcel receives the PAC District designation. The PAC District permits the Village to evaluate the need and demand for a PAC, address specific aspects of the PAC, relate the type, design and layout of a PAC to a particular site and control the impacts that such a development may have on the surrounding community. Furthermore, the PAC District is intended to discourage urban sprawl while encouraging innovative, Traditional Neighborhood developments and alternative land development practices, which will otherwise promote the public health, safety and welfare of the public, preserve or enhance property values within existing residential areas and maintain the unique character of the Village.
B. Applicability. A PAC District shall represent a mapped geographic area applied to the Zoning Districts Map according to the amendment procedures of the Village of Warwick Zoning Law.

2. Evaluations and Mitigation of Significant Impacts. The development shall not significantly impact the adjacent area, circulation and traffic, historic structures, the overall population mix of the Village, the tax rate base and any other issues as may be identified, together with a full environmental impact statement, as required.
3. Site Development Concept Plan. The development concept of all areas encompassed by a PAC District shall be adequately described by a Site Development Concept Plan comprised of scaled drawings and associated reports. At a minimum, the Site Development Concept Plan shall adequately describe:
a. The boundary and area of the PAC District, including the underlying zoning district.

Buildable acreage is defined as the gross site area minus those land areas defined in Section 145-42A of this law.
4. Site Plan Required. Prior to application for a Building Permit, Site Plan approval shall comply with the Site Plan Review procedures and requirements of the Village of Warwick Zoning Law and the Village Law.
5. Subdivision Plat Required. A subdivision plat, which identifies the individual lot upon which each principal building is to be situated shall be provided by the applicant. Such plat shall comply with the Subdivision Regulations of the Village and the Village Law.
6. Homeowners Association Required. All PACs shall be required to create a Homeowners Association, which shall have dominion over the common areas within the development. Prior to final approval of the Site Plan, the developer shall obtain such approval, acceptance, or "no action letter" as may be required by the State of New York Department of Law, pursuant to the Martin Act (General Business Law, Section 352 Et. seq.) and/or such other laws or regulations may apply to the offering for sale of common interests in realty. Copies of all submissions and responses, including but not limited to articles of incorporation and by-laws for such Homeowners Association shall be supplied to the Planning Board and Village Attorney.
E. Effect of Approval.

145-27 Annexation District (AD)
A. The purpose of the AD District is to maintain the character of existing Village density residential developments and to allow a controlled growth of the Village following traditional growth patterns. For each parcel of buildable contiguous land in single ownership, there may be identical base density as that allowed pursuant to the Town of Warwick Zoning regulations (Local Law #10 of 2002) as adopted January, 2002 and formally applicable to the annexed lands.
B. Applications for annexation shall be made to the Village Board of Trustees. The Village Board of Trustees shall refer the application to the Planning Board for input on the appropriateness of the parcel for annexation and compliance with applicable Zoning standards for the proposed project.
C. Lands proposed to be annexed to the Village of Warwick may apply for an increase in density as described in subsection D below. Applications for annexation which are not seeking increased density may be subject to § 145-27.1 for Residential Cluster Development.
D. Incentive Zoning Procedure Applicable to Annexation District. This subsection sets forth the procedure whereby an applicant for an increase in density in the Annexation District may obtain an increase in density pursuant to the authority granted to the Village under NYS Village Law §7-703.
1. "As of Right Unit Count". Preliminary As of Right Unit Count is based on the conventional subdivision lot count as described in the Town of Warwick Subdivision and Zoning Regulations.
a. The "Preliminary - As of Right" unit count shall not exceed the number of dwelling units, that in the Village Planning Board’s judgment, would be permitted if the land were subdivided into lots fully conforming with the
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 25
lot size and density requirements of the Conventional Town of Warwick Zoning applicable to the property prior to its annexation into the Village of Warwick.
b. For this determination, the applicant shall submit a subdivision plan designed so that no waivers or variances from any provision of the Town of Warwick code shall be necessary. The plan shall show the proposed lots, house sites, streets, rights-of-way and the density based on an analysis conducted in accordance with the Town of Warwick’s Environmental Control formula contained in Section 164-41.3 (Table ECF) of the Town of Warwick Zoning Code.
c. It is recognized that all necessary information may not be available in final format based on items such as certified surveys, two foot (2’) contours, and formal wetlands delineation. In this case, the "As of Right" unit count shall be knows as a "Preliminary - As of Right" unit count with a "Final - As of Right" unit count to be approved by the Town and Village Boards after all required information is available. However, this "Preliminary – As of Right" unit count will provide the Applicant, as well as the Town and Village Boards, with a good starting point for overall density calculations.
i. Prior to Final Subdivision or Site Plan Approval the final determination of the As of Right Unit Count must be based on certified two foot (2’) contours, a Jurisdictional Delineation of the Wetlands by the US Army Corps of Engineers and the DEC as appropriate or a qualified wetlands expert where such delineation is deemed adequate by the Village of Warwick Planning Board and a certified boundary survey showing all ROW’s, easements, 100 year flood plains and streams.
2. Existing Resource Map. The information required for an Existing Resource map is described in the Town of Warwick 2002 Zoning Code for Cluster Developments. A1 164-41.1
3. Area Usage Plan (i.e. bubble diagram). This map shows circles or amorphous shapes that represent potential development areas.
4. Maximum Development Density for the Project. Maximum Development Density is based on ½ acre lot size in the Net Parcel Area as determined in Section 1.i. above and is calculated by dividing the Net Parcel Area by ½ acre lot size. The Final Density of the Project will be determined only after the Design Standards in Section 147-27.E have been applied. The Net Parcel area is determined by deducting the total area of the following from the gross parcel area (this calculation of Net Parcel Area relates only to the Annexation Zone and supersedes any other calculation of Net Area described in any other sections of the Village of Warwick Zoning Law):
a. Slopes of 15% or greater over 2000 square feet or more of contiguous based on controlled two foot (2') contours.
b. Federal Jurisdictional Wetlands based on the National Wetland Inventory maps or preferably a field delineation by a qualified ecological
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 26
consultant. Final As of Right unit count to be confirmed based on Jurisdictional Determination by the Army Corps of Engineers.
c. All existing Right of Ways (ROWs) and active easements as described on the deed or survey.
d. All streams measured to the mean high water mark, lands under water, and 100 Year Flood Plains or Flood Hazard Area as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) from best available mapping. Final As of Right unit count to be confirmed on a certified survey.
e. Lands identified as sever in reference to flooding, ponding, erosion or slope by the United States Natural Resource Conservation Service.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 27
Example: 100 acres gross parcel area – 40 acres of wetlands and steep slopes = 60 net parcel area Maximum Development Density = 60 net acres / ½ acre density = 120 units
5. Escrow Fees. Applicant to deposit appropriate escrow fee to cover the cost of initial review as set forth in the fee schedule adopted by Village Board of Trustees.
6. Initial Meeting. Applicant and their design team shall meet informally with Village & Town Boards and Village Planning Board for general discussion of the proposed development. This is to establish a working dialogue between the Applicant and the Municipalities early in the process.
7. Environmental Impact Statement. Pursuant to NYS Village Law §7-703, an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) must be prepared by the applicant for any zoning district where the granting of incentives or bonuses may have a significant effect on the environment as determined by the lead agency. The EIS must, at a minimum, establish the following conditions:
a. The "As of Right" unit count from Section 145-27D.1. above.
b. The Maximum Development Density from Section 145-27D 4. above.
c. Maximum number of development units proposed on the site.
d. The number of additional development units proposed to be obtained as Annexation Units from Section 8. below.
e. Accommodations for Affordable Housing.

9. Bulk Requirements. Bulk Requirements for development under the Incentive Zoning Procedure in the Annexation District are listed in Section 145-27.E.3. “Specific Community Design Standards.”
E. Design Standards Applicable to Annexation District.
1. Applicability and Waivers. All applicable standards of this section shall be complied with, unless it is determined in the sole discretion of the Village of Warwick Planning Board that the literal enforcement of one or more standards does not advance the purpose and intent of this ordinance, are impractical or will exact undue hardships because of peculiar conditions pertaining to the tract in question. A waiver from the following standards may be granted by the Planning Board in specific cases, at its discretion, and only if it has been determined that the proposed waiver shall not create or affect any adverse impacts on the tract to be developed or on adjacent or nearby properties, and that such waiver will not materially detract from the Design Concepts intended by this ordinance. An applicant for an increase in the number of development units under this subsection shall have the burden of demonstrating that a standard is not applicable or should be waived according to the criteria specified herein.
During the review process, the Planning Board may, at its discretion, engage the services of professionals to help their review of the submitted documents. The fee for the professional will be paid from the Warwick Incentive Trust Account as prescribed by the Village-Town Intermunicipal Agreement governing annexations by the applicant upon submission of an invoice from the professional.
2. General Community Design Standards.
a. A site design shall be prepared by a team of professionals including a Land Planner, a Professional Engineer, a Landscape Architect, and a Registered Architect and should incorporate the following concepts to preserve the existing features of the land to the greatest extent practical.
The natural features of a site, including existing topography, natural watercourses, rock formations, significant hedgerows and mature trees, should be incorporated into the site design. The first step in any site design should be to assess the existing landscape and identify the site’s natural features. Significant cultural features, such as stone walls, should be preserved as much as possible. Development should work around these features, rather than be imposed on them. Sites that possess significant ecological properties such as aquifers, public water supply watersheds, wetlands, and streams, whose degradation would negatively affect other properties, should be developed in a manner that will effectively prevent the possibility of such degradation.
New development within the Annexation District shall strive to achieve the historic, time-honored standards and design characteristics of the existing Village of Warwick and the Hudson Valley region.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 30
b. A minimum of 25% percent of the gross tract area shall be reserved as common open space and/or public parks. At least fifty percent (50%) of the reserved space must be derived from Net Area of the parcel as calculated in Section 145-27.D.1.4. excluding, for this calculation, the area of any 100 ft. wetland buffer described in Section 145-27.D.1.d.
c. A mix of housing styles and housing of varying proportions shall be provided in order to create a variety of housing types and sizes consistent with the existing Village of Warwick and the Hudson Valley region.
d. Housing shall not be segregated according to unit type.
3. Specific Design Standards. The specific design standards for lands proposed to be annexed shall comply with the Traditional Neighborhood Design standards specified in § 145-28, subsections I through K.
a. There shall be a mix of three residential housing types (none less than twenty percent (20%) of the total).
145-27.1 Residential Cluster Development in the Annexation District.
A. Purposes. A subdivision is considered an open space development when lots and dwelling units are clustered closer together than otherwise permissible in a conventional subdivision and where open space is created on the remainder of the property without increasing density for the tract as a whole. Open space developments are authorized under § 7-738 of New York State Village Law, are also referred to as conservation subdivisions or open space developments, are encouraged, and where appropriate required, herein. They are intended to be applied to lands that may be annexed to the Village in the future and that are not subject to the “Intermunicipal Agreement: Town and Village of Warwick” for the Transfer of Development Rights program. All applications for annexation shall be made to the Village Board of Trustees. The Village Board of Trustees shall refer to the application to the Planning Board for input on the appropriateness of the parcel for annexation and compliance with applicable Zoning standards for the proposed project.
The purposes of open space developments on annexed lands are as follows:
1. To provide greater economy, efficiency and convenience in the siting of services and infrastructure, including the opportunity to reduce road lengths, utility runs, and the amount of paving required;
2. To conserve important open lands, including those areas containing unique and sensitive natural features such as steep slopes, floodplains, stream corridors, and wetlands by permanently setting them aside from development;
3. To provide multiple options for landowners to minimize impacts on environmental resources and natural or cultural features such as mature woodlands, hedgerows and tree lines, critical wildlife habitats, historic buildings and sites, and fieldstone walls;
4. To create neighborhoods with direct visual access to open land, with amenities in the form of neighborhood open space, with a strong neighborhood identity;
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 31
5. To provide for a balanced range of lot sizes, building densities, and housing choices to accommodate a variety of age and income groups and residential preferences, so that Warwick’s population diversity may be maintained;
6. To implement policies to conserve a variety of irreplaceable and environmentally sensitive resource lands as set forth in the Village Comprehensive Plan, including provisions to create a greenway trail system and other areas for active or passive recreational use for the benefit of present and future residents;
7. To conserve scenic views;
8. To promote development in harmony with the goals and objectives of the Village Comprehensive Plan; and
9. To mitigate identified environmental impacts under the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQR).
B. Authorization. Authorization is hereby granted to the Planning Board to modify applicable provisions of this Zoning Law as to lot size, lot width, depth, yard, and other applicable requirements of the Zoning Law, Subdivision Regulations and Street Specifications, as well as type of residential use, subject to the purposes, standards and procedures contained herein, so as to accommodate open space developments. Prior to filing a formal application for approval of a subdivision, the applicant shall participate in a pre-application conference. The applicant shall make a deposit, in accordance with the Village’s Fee Schedule, sufficient to cover the pre-application expenses required for review by the Village’s professional engineer, planner and attorney.
The Planning Board may require open space development where it finds any one (1) of the following elements present, as determined through review of an Existing Resources Map and Site Analysis Plan as described herein, justifying conservation of natural, cultural or historic resources, scenic features, or preservation of neighborhood character.
1. Slopes: slopes of fifteen percent (15%) or greater on twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the property.
2. Water resources: wetlands, aquifer and aquifer recharge areas, municipal water supply watershed areas, flood-prone areas as shown on Federal Emergency Management Agency maps, or New York State Protected Streams.
3. Agricultural lands: lands within 2,000 feet of a New York State certified Agricultural District.
4. Important Environmental Areas. Lands within or contiguous to areas identified by the Metropolitan Conservation Alliance in the Southern Wallkill Biodiversity Plan (available for the Office of the Village Clerk), areas identified as a Critical Environmental Area designated pursuant to Article 8 of the Environmental Conservation Law or other areas identified by a government agency as important for conservation purposes.
5. Designated open space areas: lands contiguous to publicly owned or designated open space areas or privately owned designated natural areas.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 32
6. Historic structures and sites: historic structures or areas of national, state or local importance.
7. Scenic Viewsheds and Special Features: sites bordering designated State, County, Village or Village Scenic Roads, or other special features identified in the Village Comprehensive Plan.
8. Trails: existing and potential trails, bikeways, and pedestrian routes of Village, Town, County or State significance.
9. Recreation: lakes, ponds or other significant recreational areas, or opportunities or sites designated in the Village Comprehensive Plan.
10. Applicant Request: on lands where the applicant has requested approval of a open space development.
The Planning Board shall require open space development where it finds any one (1) of the following elements present:
11. Significant natural areas and features: areas with rare vegetation, significant habitats, or habitats of endangered, threatened or special concern species as determined by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (Natural Heritage Program) or the Metropolitan Conservation Alliance’s Southern Wallkill Biodiversity Plan, mature forests over 100 years old, locally important vegetation (such as trees over 24” in diameter at breast height), or unique natural or geological formations.
12. Gateway locations as identified in the Village Comprehensive Plan.
C. Permitted, accessory and special permit uses:
1. Permitted, accessory and special permit uses within an open space development shall be the same as those otherwise allowed in the zoning district in which the development is located.

2. Open space land, comprising a portion of the open space development, as defined in § 145-27.1.J.
D. Density. The permitted number of dwelling units shall not exceed the number of units that, in the Planning Board’s judgment, would be permitted if the land were subdivided into lots fully conforming to the minimum lot size and density requirements of this chapter applicable to the district or districts in which such land is situated and conforming to all other requirements of the Village of Warwick Code. To determine density, the applicant shall submit a Yield Plan, designed so that no waivers from any provision of the Village of Warwick Code shall be necessary and meeting the following requirements:
1. Yield Plans shall be prepared as a conceptual sketch plan in accordance with the minimum lot sizes and other development standards for the Zoning district involved.
2. Yield plans shall show proposed lots, streets, rights-of-way, and other pertinent features.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 33
3. A fully engineered yield subdivision plan that meets all of the requirements of the Zoning Law, Subdivision Regulations, and Street Specifications to determine lot yield.
a. Fully engineered yield subdivision plans shall include conceptual drainage designs, and shall be designed so that no waivers or variances from any provision of the Village of Warwick Code shall be necessary.
b. Fully engineered yield subdivision plans shall be realistic and must not show potential house sites or streets in areas that would not ordinarily be legally permitted in a conventional subdivision. If necessary, the Planning Board may require the applicant to provide an analysis of potential compatibility or incompatibility of the yield plan with the “Standards for Issuance of Permits and Letters of Permission” found in 6 NYCRR 663.5 when sites involve State protected freshwater wetlands or other resources for which discretionary permits would be required. Any lands which are subject to flooding or are comprised of wetlands and a 100 foot upland buffer area, ponds, streams or slopes in excess of fifteen percent (15%), and prime agricultural soils shall not be considered suitable for building development for purposes of this analysis. All minimum front, side and rear yard requirements must be satisfied by measurement wholly on dry land, except to the extent which may be permitted by any other section of this Zoning Law.
E. Open space development design process. The first step in the open space design process is for an applicant to submit an Existing Resources Map and Site Analysis Plan and participate in a conceptual pre-application discussion with the Planning Board. The second step is to submit a sketch plan showing an open space layout that is responsive to the pre-application discussion with the Planning Board. The Existing Resources Map and Site Analysis Plan must be on a separate map from the Sketch Plan. The maximum permissible number of lots in an open space development will be based on the yield plans and will be the basis for the open space layout. This layout shall include an identification of primary and secondary conservation lands within a parcel(s), which includes those elements most highly valued by the community. Illustrations of the design process are provided herein to assist applicants and landowners.
1. Sketch Plan. A Sketch Plan shall be submitted by the applicant as a diagrammatic basis for informal discussions with the Planning Board regarding the design of a proposed subdivision or land development. The purpose of a sketch plan is to facilitate an expedient review of proposed new subdivisions in conformance with the Village Zoning Law and Comprehensive Plan. Sketch Plan submission is a way to help applicants and Planning Board members develop a better understanding of the property and to help establish an overall design approach that respects its special or noteworthy features, while providing for the density permitted under the Zoning Law. To provide a full understanding of the site's potential and to facilitate the most effective exchange with the Planning Board, the Sketch Plan shall include the information listed below. Many of these items can be taken from the Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan, a document that must in any case be prepared and submitted no later than the date of the Site Inspection, which precedes the Preliminary Plan.

For all sites, such maps shall be at a scale not less than 1"= 1000', and shall show the relationship of the subject property to natural and man-made features existing within 2,000 feet of the site. The features that shall be shown on Site Context Maps include topography and streams (from USGS maps), State and/or Federal wetlands, woodlands over one-half acre in area (from aerial photographs), ridgelines, public roads and trails, utility easements and rights of way, public land, and land protected under conservation easements.
2. Preliminary Plan Documents. A preliminary open space development plan shall consist of and be prepared in accordance with the following requirements, which are designed to supplement and, where appropriate, replace the requirements of the Village of Warwick Subdivision Regulations:
a. Preliminary Plan. The submission requirements for a Preliminary Plan include the requirements for Sketch Plans listed in § 145-27.1E(1) above and;
b. The submission requirements of the Subdivision Regulations, and;
c. Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan. For all open space developments (except those in which all proposed lots are to be ten or more acres in area), an Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan shall be prepared to provide the developer and the Planning Board with a comprehensive analysis of existing conditions, both on the proposed development site and within 500 feet of the site. The Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan becomes the basis for the four-step design process. Conditions beyond the parcel boundaries may be described on the basis of existing published data available from governmental agencies, and from aerial photographs.
The Planning Board shall review the Plan to assess its accuracy and thoroughness. Unless otherwise specified by the Planning Board, such plans shall be prepared at the scale of 1"=100' or 1"=200', whichever
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 35
would fit best on a single standard size sheet. The following information shall be included in this Plan:
(1) Topography, the contour lines of which shall be at two-foot intervals, determined by photogrammetry (although 10-foot intervals are permissible beyond the parcel boundaries, interpolated from published USGS maps). The determination of appropriate contour intervals shall be made by the Planning Board, which may specify greater or lesser intervals on exceptionally steep or flat sites. Slopes greater than fifteen percent (15%) shall be clearly indicated. Topography for major subdivisions shall be prepared by a professional land surveyor or professional engineer from an actual field survey of the site or from stereoscopic aerial photography and shall be coordinated with official USGS benchmarks.
(2) The location and delineation of ponds, streams, and natural drainage swales as well as the 100-year floodplains and wetlands, as defined by the State of New York and the US Army Corps of Engineers.
(3) Vegetative cover conditions on the property according to general cover type including cultivated land, permanent grass land, old field, hedgerow, woodland and wetland, isolated trees with a caliper in excess of twelve (12) inches, the actual canopy line of existing trees and woodlands. Vegetative types shall be described by plant community, relative age and condition.
(4) Soil series, types and phases, as mapped by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service in the Orange County Soil Survey, and accompanying data published for each soil relating to its suitability for construction (and, in unsewered areas, for septic suitability).
(5) Ridge lines and watershed boundaries shall be identified, if any exist.
(6) A viewshed analysis showing the location and extent of views into the property from public roads and from public parks, public forests, and other designated open space areas.
(7) Geologic formations on the proposed development parcel, based on available published information or more detailed data obtained by the applicant.
(8) The location and dimensions of all existing streets, roads, buildings, utilities and other man-made improvements.
(9) Locations of all historically significant sites or structures on the tract and on any abutting tract.
(10) Locations of trails that have been in public use (pedestrian, equestrian, bicycle, etc.) or proposed in the Village Comprehensive Plan.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 36
(11) All easements and other encumbrances of property which are or have been filed of record with the Orange County Clerk’s Office shall be shown on the plan.
3. Four-Step Design Process for Open space developments. All sketch plans shall include Step 1 of the four step design process. All preliminary plans shall include documentation of a four-step design process in determining the layout of proposed open space lands, house sites, streets and lot lines, as described below.
a. Step 1: Delineation of Open Space Lands. Proposed open space lands shall be designated using the Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan as a base map and complying with § 145-27.1E(2)(c) and the Subdivision Regulations, dealing with Resource Conservation and Greenway Delineation Standards. The Village’s Comprehensive Plan shall also be considered. Primary Conservation Areas shall be delineated comprising floodplains, wetlands and slopes over twenty-five percent (25%) as shown by example on Figure 11a. Secondary Conservation Areas shall be delineated comprising the resources listed in § 145-27.1E(2)(c) and as shown by example on Figure 11b. The applicant shall prioritize natural and cultural resources on the tract in terms of their highest to least suitability for inclusion in the proposed open
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 37
space, in consultation with the Planning Board after a site inspection, to create a prioritized list of resources to be conserved.
On the basis of those priorities and practical considerations given to the tract's configuration, its context in relation to resource areas on adjoining and neighboring properties, and the applicant's subdivision objectives, Secondary Conservation Areas shall be delineated (see Figure 11b) to meet at least the minimum area percentage requirements for open space lands and in a manner clearly indicating their boundaries as well as the types of resources included within them. Calculations shall be provided indicating the applicant's compliance with the acreage requirements for open space areas on the tract. The result is shown on Figure 11c, potential development areas. If the secondary conservation areas include active agricultural lands or contain soils classified within soil group one (1) through four (4) of the New York State Land Classification System, the siting guidelines found in § 145-27.1D shall be followed in the design process.
Figure 11a. Primary Conservation Areas
Primary conservation areas include: Freshwater wetlands and ponds Steep slope areas of 25% or more 100 year floodplains Streams
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 38
Figure 11b. Secondary Conservation Areas
Secondary conservation areas include Roads & trails Structures including foundations Stone walls and hedgerows Vegetation types by community Isolated trees Views to and from the site Steep slopes of 15 to 25% Active agricultural lands & soil groups 1-4
b. Step 2: Location of House Sites. Potential house sites shall be tentatively located (see Figure 12), using the proposed open space lands as a base map as well as other relevant data on the Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan such as topography and soils. House sites should generally be located not closer than 100 feet from Primary Conservation Areas and 50 feet from Secondary Conservation Areas, taking into consideration the potential negative impacts of residential development on such areas as well as the potential positive benefits of such locations to provide attractive views and visual settings for residences.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 39
c. Step 3: Alignment of Streets and Trails. Upon designating the house sites, a street plan shall be designed to provide vehicular access to each house, complying with the standards identified herein and bearing a logical relationship to topographic conditions as illustrated in Figure 13. Impacts of the street plan on proposed open space lands shall be minimized, particularly with respect to crossing environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands and traversing slopes exceeding 15%. Existing and future street connections are encouraged to eliminate the number of new cul-de-sacs to be maintained by the Village and to facilitate access to and from homes in different parts of the tract and adjoining parcels. Cul-de-sacs are appropriate only when they support greater open space conservation or provide extensive pedestrian linkages.
d. Step 4: Drawing In the Lot Lines. Upon completion of the preceding three steps, lot lines are drawn as required to delineate the boundaries of individual residential lots – see Figure 14.
Figure 11c. Potential Development Areas
Figure 12. House Sites
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 40
e. Where traditional streetscapes and "terminal vistas" are of great importance, Steps Two and Three may be reversed, so that streets and squares are located during the second step, and house sites are located immediately thereafter. The first step is to identify open space lands, including both Primary and Secondary Conservation Areas.
F. Dimensional standards. Except as specified herein, all dimensional standards normally applicable to other subdivisions and uses shall also be applicable to open space development.
1. Minimum required open space: In all Zoning districts, an open space development must preserve at least fifty percent (50%) of the tract’s developed acreage as open space land. Parking areas and roads shall not be included in the calculation of the minimum required open space.
2. Minimum lot width at building line: 50 feet.
3. Yard regulations: the builder or developer is urged to consider variations in the principal building position and orientation, but shall observe the following minimum standards:
Front yard: 15 feet
Rear yard: 25 feet
Side yard: 10 feet separation for principal buildings
4. Maximum impervious coverage. No more than thirty-five percent (35 %) of any given acre shall be covered with impervious surface in the form of access drives, parking areas or structures.
5. Minimum lot size. The minimum lot size shall be five thousand (5000) square feet per single-family unit. Attached or townhouse style units shall be in condominium, cooperative, or other acceptable ownership options.
G. Open space standards:
Figure 13. Aligning Streets and Trails
Figure 14. Drawing in the Lot Lines
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 41
1. The required open space land consists of a combination of Primary Conservation Areas and Secondary Conservation Areas. Primary Conservation Areas include freshwater wetlands and ponds with a one hundred (100) foot surrounding buffer area where practical, streams, lands within the 100-year floodplain, unbuildable lands with hydric or other unsuitable soils, and lands having slopes of fifteen percent (15%) or more. The proposed subdivision design shall strictly minimize disturbance of these environmentally sensitive areas. Primary Conservation Areas shall be included in the required open space area to the greatest extent practical. The applicant shall also demonstrate that such features will be protected by the proposed subdivision plan. Secondary Conservation Areas include special features of the property that would ordinarily be overlooked or ignored during the design process such as agricultural lands, woodlands, significant natural areas and features, stone walls, hedgerows, meadows, historic structures and sites, historic rural corridors, scenic viewsheds, and trails. Secondary Conservation Areas shall be included in the required open space area to the greatest extent practical such that protecting these resources will, in the judgment of the Planning Board, achieve the purposes of this section.
2. Open space lands shall be laid out in general accordance with the Village Comprehensive Plan to better enable an interconnected network of open space.
3. A recreational fee in lieu of land, as set forth in the Village’s fee schedule, shall be imposed to accommodate the foreseeable recreational needs of the proposed subdivision’s residents. Upon the recommendation of the Planning Board and where the Village Board of Trustees deems it appropriate for land to be deeded for recreational purposes, up to ten percent (10%) of the total acreage may be subject to the Village’s recreational land dedication requirement. Typically, this acreage will be used to provide potential connections within the Village’s long-range trail network.
4. Active agricultural land with farm buildings may be used to meet the minimum required open space land. Access to open space land used for agriculture may be appropriately restricted for public safety and to prevent interference with agricultural operations. Land used for agricultural purposes shall be buffered from residential uses, either bordering or within the tract, by a minimum setback of at least two hundred (200) feet and if practical three hundred (300) feet deep. No clearing of trees or understory growth shall be permitted in this setback (except as may be necessary for street or trail construction). Where this buffer is unwooded, the Planning Board may require vegetative screening to be planted, or that it be managed to encourage natural forest succession through “no-mow” policies and the periodic removal of invasive alien plant and tree species.
5. Open space land should generally remain undivided. No individual parcel of common open space shall be less than one (1) acre except as to roadway median strips, traffic islands, walkways, trails, courtyards, play areas, recreation facilities, drainageways leading directly to streams, historic sites or unique natural features requiring common ownership protection.
6. No portion of any house lot may be used for meeting the minimum required open space land unless encumbered with a conservation restriction.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 42
H. House lot standards. Development areas for the location of house lots include the necessary building envelope for each dwelling unit, constituting the remaining lands of the tract outside of the designated open space areas. House lots shall be designed in accordance with the following standards:
1. House lots shall not encroach upon Primary Conservation Areas and their layout shall respect Secondary Conservation Areas.
2. All new dwellings shall meet the following setback requirements to the greatest extent practicable:
a. From agricultural lands either bordering or within the tract 200 feet
b. From buildings or barnyards housing livestock 300 feet
c. From active recreation areas such as courts or playing fields (not including tot lots) 150 feet
3. Views of house lots from exterior roads and abutting properties shall be minimized by the use of changes in topography, existing vegetation, or additional landscaping which meets the landscaping requirements of the Zoning Law and Subdivision Regulations.
4. House lots shall generally be accessed from interior streets, rather than from roads bordering the tract. New intersections with existing public roads shall be minimized. Although two access ways into and out of subdivisions containing twenty (20) or more dwellings are generally required for safety, proposals for more than two entrances onto public roads shall be discouraged if they would unnecessarily disrupt traffic flow or unduly impact the environment.
5. At least three-quarters of the lots shall directly abut or face conserved open space, if practical.
I. Streets and driveways.
1. Common driveway access may be provided to serve up to six (6) dwellings. Common driveways should be 16 feet wide or, at a minimum, provide for vehicle pull-offs that are 16 feet in width at intervals no less than every 500 feet. A pedestrian circulation and/or trail system shall be designated and installed sufficient for the needs of residents, as deemed practical by the Planning Board.
2. Open space development streets shall meet the Village Street Specifications, unless access arrangements have been made in accordance with § 7-732 of New York State Village Law. Open space developments containing twenty (20) lots or more shall have at least two (2) connections with existing streets or streets on an approved subdivision plat for which a bond has been filed. Regardless of the street design employed, the applicant shall demonstrate and the Planning Board shall find that emergency services access is adequate for the number of dwellings proposed.
3. Straight segments connected by 90 degree and 135 degree bends are preferred.
4. Whenever appropriate, street systems should produce terminal vistas of open space in accordance with the conservation emphasis of the open space
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 43
development design and to positively contribute to the open space goals of the Village.
5. The use of reverse curves should be considered for local access streets in open space developments in conjunction with long horizontal curve radii (at least 250 feet) and where traffic speeds will not exceed 30 mph.
6. Single-loaded streets are encouraged alongside conservation areas to provide views of the conservation lands for residents and visitors.
7. Street trees may be required, depending upon the open or wooded character of the parcel, in accordance with the Subdivision Regulations.
J. Permanent protection of open space. Conservation easements are the preferred method to protect open space under Article 49 of the New York State Environmental Conservation Law. In all cases, the permanent preservation of such open space shall be legally assured to the satisfaction of the Planning Board and Village Attorney and the Village Board shall be granted third party enforcement rights to enforce the terms of the conservation restriction. The following regulations shall apply:
1. If a conservation easements is proposed, the conservation easement shall be titled to a private conservation organization provided that:
a. The conservation organization is acceptable to the Village and is a bona fide conservation organization as defined in Article 49 of the New York State Environmental Conservation Law;
b. The conveyance contains appropriate provisions for proper reverter or retransfer in the event that the conservation organization becomes unwilling or unable to continue carrying out its functions; and
c. A maintenance agreement acceptable to the Village is established between the owner and the conservation organization to insure perpetual maintenance of the open space.
2. The conservation restriction shall permanently restrict the open space from future subdivision, shall define the range of permitted activities, and shall give the Village the ability to enforce these restrictions. Under no circumstances shall any development be permitted in the open space at any time, except for the following uses:
a. Conservation of open land in its natural state (for example, woodland, fallow field, or managed meadow). The clearing of woodland shall generally be prohibited, except as necessary to create trails and active recreation facilities. The determination of necessity shall lie with the Planning Board.
b. Game preserve, wildlife sanctuary, or other similar conservation use.
c. Woodlots, arboreta, agriculture and silviculture in keeping with established standards for best management practices, selective harvesting, and sustained-yield forestry.
d. Neighborhood open space uses such as village greens, commons, picnic areas, community gardens, trails, and similar low-impact passive recreational uses specifically excluding motorized off-road vehicles, rifle
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 44
ranges, and other uses similar in character and potential impact as determined by the Planning Board.
e. Active non-commercial recreation areas, such as playing fields, playgrounds, and courts, provided such areas do not consume more than half of the minimum required open space land or five acres, whichever is less. Playing fields, playgrounds, and courts shall not be located within 150 feet of abutting properties nor shall such facilities be equipped with lighting. Parking facilities for the same shall also be permitted, and they shall generally be gravel-surfaced, unlighted, properly drained, provide safe ingress and egress, and contain no more than ten parking spaces. Such recreation uses may be a public park or recreation area owned and operated by a public or private nonprofit agency, but shall not include storage of materials, trucking or repair facilities, or private or municipal sanitary landfills.
f. Stormwater detention areas designed, landscaped, and available for use as an integral part of the open space area.
g. Easements for drainage; access, sewer or water lines, or other public purposes.
h. Underground utility rights-of-way. Above ground utility and street rights-of-way may traverse conservation areas but shall not count toward the minimum required open space land.
K. Ownership of open space land and common facilities. The following methods may be used, either individually or in combination, for ownership of open space land (exclusive of its conservation easement) and common facilities. Open space trails may be initially offered for dedication to the Village. Open space land and common facilities shall not be transferred to another entity except for transfer to another method of ownership permitted under this section. Ownership methods shall conform to the following:
(1) Fee simple dedication to the Village. The Village may, but shall not be required to, accept any portion of the open space land and common facilities, provided that:
(a) There is no substantial cost of acquisition to the Village; and
(b) the Village agrees to and has access to maintain such facilities; and
(c) such facilities for public use shall be accessible to residents of the Village.
(2) Homeowners’ Association. Open space land and common facilities may be held in common ownership by a homeowners’ association, subject to all of the provisions for homeowners’ associations set forth in New York State regulations. In addition, the following regulations shall be met:
(a) The applicant shall provide the Village with a description of the organization of the proposed association, including its by-laws, and all documents governing ownership, maintenance, and use restrictions for common facilities.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 45
(b) The proposed association shall be established by the owner or applicant and shall be operating (with financial subsidization by the owner or applicant, if necessary) before the sale of any dwelling units in the development.
(c) Membership in the association shall be mandatory for each property owner within the subdivision and successive owners in title with voting rights of one vote per lot or unit, and the subdivider’s control, therefore, passing to the individual lot/unit owners on sale of the majority of the lots or units.
(d) The association shall be responsible for liability insurance, local taxes and maintenance of open space land, recreational facilities and other commonly held facilities.
(e) The by-laws shall confer legal authority on the association to place a lien on the real property of any member who falls delinquent in his or her dues. Such dues shall be paid with the accrued interest before the lien may be lifted.
(f) Written notice of any proposed transfer of common facilities by the association or the assumption of maintenance for common facilities must be given to all members of the association and to the Village no less than thirty (30) days prior to such event.
(g) The association shall have adequate resources to administer, maintain, and operate such common facilities.
(3) Non-common private ownership. The required open space land may be included within one or more large “conservancy lots” provided the open space is permanently restricted from future development.
L. Maintenance. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Planning Board, the cost and responsibility of maintaining common open space and facilities shall be borne by the homeowners’ association, conservation organization, private owner, or, in the case of open space and facilities deeded to the Village, the municipality.
145-28 Traditional Neighborhood Design Overlay District
A. Intent. The purpose of the Traditional Neighborhood Design Overlay District (TND-O) is to provide for the development of new neighborhoods and the revitalization and expansion of existing neighborhoods in a manner that promotes diversity in housing type and size, provides for multiple transportation options, mixed uses and civic functions consistent with the historic development patterns of the Village. The TND-O District promotes the physical, visual, and social characteristics of the Village where people live, work and shop within a walkable pedestrian-oriented area.
TNDs are subject to review and approval by the Village Board of Trustees in accordance with the provisions of § 145-28.D. A Concept Plan is created first as an illustrative design for the overall future development of a traditional neighborhood. The Concept Plan is not a final design plan but is intended to serve as a template for
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 46
the application of specified design principles in order to achieve a desired form and appearance of developments. By creating a long-term plan, some impacts may be prevented that would have occurred with uncoordinated piecemeal expansion. The development of a Concept Plan is intended to provide the surrounding community and the Village with information about, and an opportunity to comment on, the traditional neighborhood’s future development. The plan also allows the developer of the TND and the Village to address the effects of future development. Finally, an approved TND Concept Plan is intended to ensure that the uses will be allowed to develop in a manner consistent with the plan. Concept plans may be completed at various levels of detail. Generally, the more specific the plan, the less review will be required as the future permitted and specially permitted uses are built. All TNDs, are subject to approval by the Village Board of Trustees, and then are subject to Site Plan, Subdivision, and where required, Conditional Use Permit approval by the Village Planning Board.
B. Purpose. The purposes of the Traditional Neighborhood Design District are to:
1. Preserve and foster the distinctive sense of place of the Village of Warwick.
2. Ensure that future development conforms to the traditional compact, pedestrian-oriented and mixed-use neighborhood pattern of the existing Village.
3. Create a range of housing opportunities and choices.
4. Extend walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods.
5. Distribute a range of open space including greens, squares and playgrounds within neighborhoods.
6. Provide a variety of transportation choices, reduce traffic congestion and allow independence to those who do not drive by ensuring that daily living activities occur within walking distance of most dwellings.
7. Encourage community and stakeholder collaboration in development decisions.
8. Take advantage of compact building design.
9. Make development decisions predictable, fair and cost- effective.
10. Ensure that the TNDs are village-like in form and scale and comprise open space, trails and a pedestrian-friendly environment.
11. Work towards fulfillment of the policies established by the Hudson River Valley Greenway and as espoused by Duany Plater-Zyberk & Company, the original authors of the “SmartCode” upon which portions of this Section of the Zoning Law has been based.
C. Applicability
1. The TND-O applies to parcels that have been designated within the TND-O District as illustrated on the Village of Warwick Zoning Districts Map.
2. All other provisions of the Village of Warwick Zoning Law and Subdivision Regulations continue to be applicable to issues not covered by this Article except where these would contradict the Intent and Purposes Sections, in which case the conflict shall be resolved in favor of this Article.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 47
3. The use of the following three terms are integral to the effectiveness of this Article whereby “shall” indicates the provision is required, “should” is utilized when a provision is recommended, and “may” notes when a provision is optional.
4. In the event of any conflict, the provisions of this Article shall take precedence over those of other Village of Warwick codes, ordinances, regulations and standards.
5. Terms used throughout this Article shall take their commonly accepted meanings unless defined in § 145-180. In the event of conflict between these definitions and those of other Village of Warwick Laws and regulations, use of this Article shall take precedence.
D. Application Procedure
1. TNDs are first subject to approval of an overall Concept Plan by the Village Board of Trustees for lands within the TND-O Zoning District. The TND-O Zoning District does not affect the underlying Zoning District provisions. If applicants wish to avail themselves of the density and other bonuses available for TND developments, then an application for Concept Plan review and approval shall be made to the Village Board of Trustees. The use of a collaborative charrette planning process, modeled on the guidelines and standards established by the National Charrette Institute (NCI), is required for the development of the Concept Plan. The Village Board shall assure full opportunity for public participation in the development of the Concept Plan.
2. The applicant shall submit to the Village Board of Trustees a Concept Plan that includes all of the following components:
a. General Statement. The Concept Plan shall include a narrative which describes how the proposal serves the purposes of the district as outlined in § 145-28.B. This narrative shall include information about potential phasing, an explanation of how the proposal complies with the design standards set forth herein, a description of the housing mix including affordable units and other proposed uses, and a discussion of compliance with the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) for New Construction and LEED for Homes Green Building Rating System standards.
b. Environmental Analysis. The Concept Plan shall include a map showing New York State protected freshwater wetlands, Federal jurisdictional wetlands, streams, 100 year floodplains, biodiversity conservation areas as identified by the Metropolitan Conservation Alliance in their Southern Wallkill Biodiversity Plan (which is on file in the Office of the Village Clerk), areas of fifteen percent (15%) and greater slope, and such other environmental features and development limitations that would affect development of the site.
c. Request for Incentives. If the applicant is requesting a density bonus in accordance with § 145-28.H, then all required materials as outlined in such Section shall be submitted as part of the Concept Plan.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 48
d. Site Plan. The Concept Plan shall include an illustrative Site Plan, showing at an appropriate level of detail, buildings and other structures; the pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicle circulation system; vehicle parking areas; open space areas; and other required items. The conceptual Site Plan shall be designed to be an illustrative plan that can serve as a template for the application of specified design principles in order to achieve a desired form and appearance of development. The information provided shall include the following:
(1) All improvements planned in conjunction with the proposed uses including general locations, layout, and dimensions of structures, parking areas, streets, utilities, recreation areas, conservation areas, and other information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Subsection (2)(a) above, including square footage of building floor area, numbers of residential units, and impervious surface coverage.
(2) Conceptual plans for possible future uses.
(3) Project phasing. Project phasing is a means to provide transportation, water supply, wastewater, emergency, school and other accommodations sufficient to meet the needs of proposed residential and commercial uses. The phasing plan shall include the proposed sequence of phasing of the construction of infrastructure and buildings and the ratio of residential, retail, and other non-residential floor space to be built in each phase, estimated dates, and interim uses of property awaiting development. In addition the plan should address any proposed temporary uses or locations of uses during construction periods.
(4) Fiscal impact. A standard fiscal impact model, such as the one described in Rutgers University’s Center for Urban Policy Research publication entitled The Fiscal Impact Handbook, may be used to describe such fiscal effects.
(5) Projected transportation impacts. These include the expected number of trips (peak and daily), an analysis of the impact of those trips on the adjacent street system, and proposed mitigation measures to limit any projected negative impacts. Mitigation measures may include improvements to the street system or specific programs to reduce traffic impacts such as encouraging the use of public transit, carpools, vanpools, pedestrian and bicycle facilities as well as proposed connections to existing or planned pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and other alternatives to single occupancy vehicles.
e. SEQR – DGEIS. The Concept Plan shall be subject to review of a Draft Generic Environmental Impact Statement under SEQR. The level of detail provided should reflect the degree to which the applicant has refined their conceptual plans. The level of detail provided in the DGEIS may affect the site-specific SEQR review required at the Site
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 49
Plan, Subdivision Plan and Conditional Use Permit review stages. When more site-specific information is provided at the DGEIS stage, lesser information may be required at the site-specific SEQR review stage. In any case, the 6 NYCRR 617 review procedures for generic environmental impact statements shall govern the generic and site specific review processes.
f. Planning Board. If the Village Board receives a proposal for approval of a TND Concept Plan, the Village Board shall refer such Concept Plan to the Village Planning Board for its review and recommendations. The Planning Board shall review the TND Concept Plan and shall discuss it with the applicant at a regular meeting. The Planning Board may invite informal public comment at such a meeting. The Planning Board shall report its recommendations to the Village Board within sixty (60) days after its next regularly scheduled meeting following the date of such referral of the proposed Concept Plan. The Planning Board's recommendation may be to adopt, adopt with modifications, or reject the proposed TND Concept Plan. If the Planning Board fails to report within sixty (60) days, it shall be deemed to have no objections.
g. Architectural and Historic District Review Board. If the Village Board receives a proposal for approval of a TND Concept Plan, the Village Board shall refer such Concept Plan to the Village Architectural and Historic District Review Board (AHDRB) for its review and recommendation. The AHDRB shall report its recommendation to the Village Board within sixty (60) days after its next regularly scheduled meeting following the date of such referral of the proposed Concept Plan. The AHDRB’s recommendation may be to adopt, adopt with modifications, or reject the proposed traditional neighborhood Concept Plan. If the AHDRB fails to report within (sixty) 60 days, it shall be deemed to have no objections.
h. Public Hearing. Prior to approving a TND Concept Plan, the Village Board shall hold a public hearing on the Concept Plan. If the Planning Board or the AHDRB provides a report recommendation to the Village Board, as provided for in § 145-28.D(f) and (g), said reports shall become an official part of the minutes of the public hearing.
i. Village Board Action. The Village Board shall refer the application to the Orange County Department of Planning, under Section 239-m of General Municipal Law, prior to taking action on the application. Following completion of the public hearing and the Generic SEQR review process, the Village Board may act to approve, approve with modifications or conditions, or disapprove the TND Concept Plan application in the exercise of its sole legal discretion.
j. Development Plan; Planning Board Approval. Prior to the issuance of any building permit within a TND-O District, detailed Site Plan, conditional use permit application (as applicable) and subdivision plans shall be approved by the Planning Board in accordance with the Site Plan Review provisions of Article IX of the Village Zoning Law, the Conditional Use Approval provisions of Article XI of the Village
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 50
Zoning Law, and the Subdivision Regulations, and no building or other site development shall be carried out except in conformity with such approved plans and permits.
(1) The Planning Board shall not approve any subdivision plan for a TND unless said Board finds that the plan is in substantial conformance with the Concept Plan which served as the basis for the Village Board approval. If the Planning Board finds substantial differences from the Concept Plan, the Planning Board shall refer the proposed plan to the Village Board for review and re-approval.
(2) The Planning Board shall not approve any Site Plan for a TND unless said Board finds that the Site Plan is in substantial conformance with the Concept Plan which served as the basis for the Village Board approval. If the Planning Board finds substantial differences from the Concept Plan, the Planning Board shall refer the proposed plan to the Village Board for review and re-approval.
(3) The Planning Board shall not approve any conditional use permit for a TND unless said Board finds that the use is in substantial conformance with the Concept Plan which served as the basis for the Village Board approval. If the Planning Board finds substantial differences from the Concept Plan, the Planning Board shall refer the proposed plan to the Village Board for review and re-approval.
E. Uses. The TND-O is a mixed use zone where the land is devoted to residential and non-residential uses. The TND-O is designed to be flexible so that the Village Board and the applicant can adjust the balance of uses to best serve the needs of present and future residents of the Village. The broad mix of uses is to include residential, retail, office, lodging and others as identified in Table1 below. The TND-O is normally composed of two areas, the residential mixed-use and the commercial mixed-use areas. The commercial mixed-use areas are intended to be, but are not required to be, composed of mixed-use building types that accommodate retail, offices, and dwellings including townhouses, lodging and apartments. This area is a tight network of streets and blocks with sidewalks, street tree planting and buildings set close to the frontages. The residential mixed-use areas are intended to be, but are not required to be, composed of primarily residential uses with mixed uses usually confined to certain corner locations. The residential mixed-use areas have a wide range of building types including single-family, two-family and townhouses. Setbacks and street tree settings are variable.
The geographic determination and scope of the commercial mixed-use and Residential mixed-use areas within a TND shall be made through the Concept Plan approval process described in § 145-28D. There shall be full opportunity for public participation in the geographic determination and scope of the commercial mixed-use and residential mixed-use areas during preparation of the Concept Plan.

F. Variances. The following standards and provisions shall not be made available for variances:
1. The maximum dimensions of traffic lanes.
2. The minimum residential densities.
3. The permission to build ancillary apartments.
4. The requirements of parking location.
G. Base Residential Density. The overall density of the site shall be calculated in terms of housing units based upon the Net Site Area as determined below. Once the overall density has been determined, units will be converted into other permitted uses to achieve the desired mix of land uses within the project.
1. Density shall be calculated based on the Net Site Area. The Net Site Area is the acreage that remains after subtracting:
a. New York State protected freshwater wetlands and their associated one hundred foot (100') adjacent buffer area
b. Federal jurisdictional wetlands
c. Streams
d. 100-year floodplains
e. Areas of slopes 15% gradient and greater
f. 10% of the gross site area assigned to civic space.
2. The overall density shall be calculated as follows. For purposes of density calculation, the Net Site Area shall include the thoroughfares (i.e., there is no deduction for a roadway allowance) but not land allocated to civic use.
a. For the residential mixed-use areas, overall density is calculated in terms of housing units at 4 units per Net Site Area acreage.
b. For the commercial mixed-use areas, overall density is calculated in terms of housing units at 6 units per Net Site Area acreage.
3. Accessory dwellings do not count toward the maximum density calculations. The maximum size of an accessory dwelling unit shall not exceed 600 square feet.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 53
4. The overall density may be increased by the density incentive provisions as follows:
a. For the residential mixed-use areas, overall density may be increased by the density incentive provisions up to 10 units per acre.
b. For the commercial mixed-use areas, overall density may be increased by the density incentive provisions up to 20 units per acre.
5. Density may be increased at the option of the applicant through the provisions for Incentive Zoning as outlined in § 145-28.H.
6. For TND projects on parcels of less than 20 acres, the overall mix of land uses is flexible. Such projects should incorporate a minimum of zero percent (0%) to up to a maximum of thirty percent (30%) mix of land uses other than residential (i.e., lodging, office, retail, civic, education) in the residential mixed-use areas and up to fifty percent (50%) mix of land uses other than residential in the commercial mixed-use areas. For TND projects on parcels of 20 acres and greater, the Village Board shall use the guidelines outlined herein as standards to be achieved. Regardless of the size of the proposed TND, the Village Board remains responsible for determining the appropriate mix of residential to other land uses by exchanging the overall housing units for other uses at the following rates:
a. For lodging: 4 bedrooms (for rent) for each unit of overall density.
b. For office or retail: 800 square feet for each unit of overall density.
7. Fifteen percent (15%) of the total housing units (after units have been exchanged as described in 5) shall be in the affordable housing range. These units must have a similar exterior to the market rate units, but can vary by square footage and amenities.
8. Buildings may be dedicated to uses described in Tables 1 and 2 of § 145-28.E. There should be a mix of residential housing types (none less than twenty percent (20%) of the total) for each residential mixed-use development.
9. Each project shall assign at least ten percent (10%) of its gross area to civic space. Civic space is permanently dedicated to open space such as a park, playground or village green.
H. Density Incentives. It is the purpose of this section to permit the Village Board to grant incentives, to the private sector engaged in the land development process, to advance the specific policies in accordance with the Village of Warwick Comprehensive Plan (2004) and in coordination with other community planning mechanisms or land-use techniques.

d. Any other information or support materials as needed or requested by the Village Board.
e. Village Board Action. Review of applications for incentives shall be processed as part of the TND Concept Plan approval process as described in § 145-28-D of this Zoning Law.
I. Circulation Standards. The circulation of pedestrians, bicycles and vehicles are an integral part of the traditional neighborhood and travel ways for all three must be accommodated. Roads consist of vehicular lanes and public frontages. Roads provide for traffic and parking and are to be designed according to desired speed for a particular area as described below and illustrated in Figure 1. The public frontage is the area between the private lot line and the edge of the vehicular lane. Elements of the public frontage include sidewalks, curbing, planters, street trees and streetlights. Pedestrian comfort shall be a primary design consideration.

c. Block Size. In the Residential mixed-use areas, the circulation system shall be designed to define blocks not exceeding a maximum block perimeter of 2,400 feet and in the commercial mixed-use areas 2,000 feet measured as the sum of the lot frontage lines.
d. Connected Roads. All roads shall terminate at other roads, forming a network. Internal roads shall connect wherever possible to those on adjacent sites. If the adjacent property is undeveloped, and the road must temporarily be a dead-end road, the right-of-way and improvements shall be extended to the property line, and a temporary circular turnaround shall be provided on all temporary dead-end roads, with the notation on the plat that land outside the road right-of-way shall revert to abutters whenever the road is continued. The use of cul-de-sacs and other roadways with a single point of access shall be permitted only where no other alternatives exist. Where cul-de-sacs are deemed to be unavoidable, continuous pedestrian circulation shall be provided for by connecting sidewalks that link the end of the cul-de-sac with the next street or open space through the use of pedestrian paths. To the greatest extent practical, streets shall either continue through an
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 58
intersection, or terminate with a “T” intersection directly opposite the center of a building, or a view into an open space area.
e. Lot Frontage. Lots shall front on a vehicular lane, except that twenty percent (20%) of the lots may front on a pedestrian passage.
f. Rear Lanes. If proposed, rear lanes shall be permitted to bisect blocks and to provide secondary access to adjoining properties. The following provisions shall apply:
(1) Lanes shall be treated as private streets and shall not be dedicated to the Village. Lanes may be dedicated to the property owners’ association or may be dedicated as common easements across the rear portions of lots.
(2) Any lot having access from a lane shall additionally front upon a public street.
(3) Lanes shall be paved with pervious block pavers.
(4) Curbing shall not be required except at corners of intersections with other street types. At such corner locations, curbing shall be required for the entire corner radius and five (5) feet preceding same. Such curbing shall not extend more than six (6) inches above the finished pavement.
(5) Lane lighting shall be provided on all garages or on utility poles or lighting poles adjacent to parking areas. Lighting fixtures and lighting poles shall be of consistent architectural style and shall complement the predominant architectural theme.
g. Bicycle Network. A network of bicycle trails and routes should be provided throughout and should be connected to existing or proposed networks wherever possible.
2. Public Frontage. Elements of the public frontage include civic space, sidewalks, curbing, planters, street trees and streetlights.

b. Design Guidelines – See Figure 3 for an illustration of the components.
(1) Width. The width of the public frontage shall be a minimum of 12 feet and a maximum of 18 feet.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 60
(2) Curb. For frontages incorporating drainage, there shall be a raised curb with a 5 to 20 foot turning radius. No curb is required where drainage is proposed as open swales. Asphalt curbing is prohibited.
(3) Walkways. The public frontage shall contain a 5 foot (minimum) to 8 foot (maximum) sidewalk.
(4) Planting strip. The public frontage shall contain a continuous 8 foot (minimum) to a 12 foot (maximum) strip.
(5) Landscaping. The public frontage shall include trees planted in a regularly-spaced alee pattern of single or alternated species with shade canopies of a height that, at maturity, clears three stories but remains predominantly clear of building frontages. The species of landscape installed shall consist primarily of native species tolerant of soil compaction and requiring minimal irrigation, fertilization and maintenance. Appropriate species include but are not limited to: Trees: Tulip Poplar, Hickory, White Oak, Red Maple, Red Oak, Pin Oak, Chinese Elm, Green Ash, Gingko Biloba, Honey Locust (Thornless), London Plane Trees. All such trees shall have a caliper of at least 2 1/2 inches at a height of three feet above finished grade.
(6) Stormwater – Plans for stormwater pollution prevention shall comply with all applicable State and Local regulations as may be amended from time to time.
(7) Streetlights.
(a) Streetlights shall be provided on both sides of all streets at intervals of no greater than seventy-five (75) feet on center and at intersections.
(b) Streetlights shall utilize cast-iron posts not exceeding 12 feet in height.
(c) Lighting posts and fixtures shall be post or column style and shall complement the predominant architectural theme.
(d) Streetlights shall be located between the street curb or pavement and the sidewalk.
J. Design Standards
1. Lot Dimension
a. The lot width shall be a minimum of 18 feet and a maximum of 96 feet.
b. A variety of lot sizes (see Figure 4) should be provided to eliminate the appearance of a standardized subdivision and to facilitate housing diversity and choice that meets the projected requirements of people with different housing needs. Lot widths should create a relatively
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 61
symmetrical street cross section that reinforces the public space of the street as a simple, unified public space.
2. Building Coverage, Height and Placement
a. Lot coverage shall not exceed 70%.
b. One principal building at the frontage, and one outbuilding to the rear of it, may be built on each lot as shown on Figure 5.
c. Building Setbacks.
(1) The front setback shall be a minimum of 10 feet and a maximum of 25 feet.
(2) The side setback shall be zero feet minimum and a maximum of 10 feet for single-family structures.
(3) The rear setback shall be 10 feet minimum or 15 feet minimum from the centerline of the lane.
(4) In the case of an infill lot, setbacks shall match one or the other of the existing adjacent setbacks.
(5) Buildings shall be placed in relation to the boundaries of their lots utilizing Edge Yard, Side Yard or Rear Yard disposition as illustrated in Figure 6.
Figure 4: Lot size variety within a neighborhood.
Figure 5: Relationship of buildings to the frontage and to each other.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 62
Figure 6: Appropriate building disposition for a traditional neighborhood.
(6) The minimum height for a principal building is 2 stories and the maximum is 3 stories. The maximum height for an outbuilding is 2 stories.
(7) Build-to line. Each block shall be designed with a uniform build-to line that shall establish the front yard setback for the lots on the block. The function of the build-to line is to form a distinct street edge and define the border between the public space of the street and the private space of the individual lot. The build-to line shall fall between the minimum and maximum front yard setbacks.
(8) Buildings shall define the streetscape through the use of uniform setbacks along the build-to line for each block. The build-to line shall be generally continued across side yard set-back areas between buildings by using landscaping. The streetscape shall also be reinforced by lines of closely planted shade trees, and may be further reinforced by walls, hedges or fences which define front yards.
3. Private Frontages. The private frontage is the area between the building and the lot lines. This private area that adjoins the public frontage is often a frequently utilized place for social interaction. Figure 7 shows the location of the private frontage among the other elements of urban design. In the Residential mixed-use areas, the standards identified as T3 or T4 (noted in Figure 8) apply. In the commercial mixed-use areas, the standards identified as T4, T5 or T6 (noted in Figure 8) apply.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 63
Figure 7: Cross section of an urban street.
a. The private frontages illustrated in Figure 8 are permitted:
Figure 8: Descriptions of private frontage types.
(1) Facades shall be built parallel to the principal frontage line or parallel to the tangent of a curved principal frontage line.
(2) Retractable cloth awnings, supported by iron or similar frames, may encroach into or over the public sidewalk up to three feet six inches (3’ 6”) provided there is a clear space of eight feet (8’) from the sidewalk to the iron frame of the awning, and no part of such awning shall be at a distance less than seven feet (7’) from the sidewalk. Stoops may encroach 100% of the depth of a setback. Open porches and non-retractable awnings may encroach up to 50% of the depth of the setback. Balconies
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 64
and bay windows may encroach up to 25% of the depth of the setback.
(3) Permanent awnings require the approval of the Village Board of Trustees, in accordance with § 177-8 of the Village Code.
4. Landscaping
a. In addition to street trees, a minimum of one tree to match the species of street trees on the Public Frontage shall be planted within the First Layer of the Private Frontage for each 30 feet of frontage.
b. The species of landscape installed shall consist primarily of native species requiring minimal irrigation, fertilization and maintenance.
5. Signs. Signs are regulated in §145-81 of the Zoning Law.
6. Utilities
a. All utilities shall be placed underground and shall be situated in rear lanes or in the Public Frontage.
7. Parking Standards
a. Each use, including a change or expansion of a use, shall provide parking areas in compliance with this Section. No building shall be occupied and no use shall be commenced until the improvements required by this Section are completed and approved by the Village Code Enforcement Officer.
b. Number of Spaces.
(1) Vehicular parking shall be provided as noted in Table 6:

c. On-street parking available along the frontage lines that correspond to each lot shall be counted toward the parking requirement of the building on the lot.
d. Parking for two dissimilar functions within any pair of adjacent blocks may be shared and is strongly encouraged. Shared parking is calculated by adding the total number of spaces required by each separate function and dividing the total by the appropriate Sharing Factor from Figure 9. An example of shared parking calculation: The residential use requires 10 spaces while the office portion requires 12 spaces. Independently they would require 22 spaces, but when divided by the sharing factor of 1.4, they would require only 16 spaces. A second way to calculate: If there are 22 spaces available for residential and office functions, multiplying this by the factor 1.4 gives the equivalent of 30 spaces. Buildings are allowed corresponding to 30 parking spaces.
e. Location.
(1) All parking, other than on-street, shall be located at the third layer as shown in Figure 10.
Figure 10: Note the third layer is located at the rear of the lot.
Figure 9: Shared Parking Factor
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 66
(2) Garages shall be located at the third layer.
(3) Parking shall be accessed from the rear lane.
(4) Parking lots shall be masked from the frontage by a linear building or Streetscreen.
(5) A minimum of one bicycle rack shall be provided within the Public or Private Frontage for every ten vehicular parking spaces associated with commercial uses.
K. Architectural Standards
1. Architectural character. Buildings may be either traditional in their architectural character, or be a contemporary expression of traditional styles and forms respecting the scale, proportion, character and materials of historic hamlet structures.
2. Architectural variety. A variety of architectural features and building materials is encouraged to give each building or group of buildings a distinct character.
3. Building mass. Buildings of 40 feet or more in width along a frontage shall be visually divided into smaller increments to reduce their apparent size and contribute to a human-scale development. The mass of these buildings shall be de-emphasized in a variety of ways through architectural details such as divisions or breaks in materials, window bays, separate entrances and entry treatments, variation in roof lines, awnings, or the use of sections that may project or be recessed up to 10 feet.
4. Building materials. The exterior finish materials on all facades shall be limited to natural building materials that age gracefully such as brick, stucco, wood clapboard, and vertical wood board and batten. Synthetic materials, such as painted fiber cement board siding, are also allowed if they faithfully simulate the natural material and have equal or better weathering characteristics. Balconies and porches shall be made of painted wood or metal. Windows, plastic gutters, siding, fencing and shutters made of vinyl, plastic or similar material are prohibited.
5. Sloped roofs. Buildings shall have sloped roofs. Roofs shall be symmetrically sloped no less than 7:12, except that porches and attached sheds may be no less than 2:12.
6. Shape of openings. All openings, including porches, galleries, and windows, with the exception of storefronts, shall be square or vertical in proportion.
7. Divided light windows. True divided light windows or simulated divided lights should be used. Windows with the snap on grids are discouraged.
8. Sliders. Doors and windows that operate as sliders are prohibited along frontages.
9. Retail Frontages. The facades on retail frontages shall be detailed as storefronts and glazed no less than 70% of the sidewalk-level story.
10. Front porches. Front porches shall be no less than 8’ deep
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 67
11. Fences. Fences, if provided, shall be within the First Layer Lot as illustrated in Figure 10. Fences at other layers may be of painted wood board or chain link.
12. LEED Standards. Wherever possible, building materials and systems should be used that meet the established standards and practices of the U.S. Green Building Council “Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design” (LEED) program.
L. Phasing. The purpose of this subsection is to ensure that growth in a TND-O occurs in an orderly and planned manner that allows time for the Village to prepare for and to maintain high quality services for an expanded residential population while allowing a reasonable amount of additional residential growth during those preparations. Key services would be under considerable strain unless TND developments are phased. This Subsection will relate timing of development in a TND-O for projects consisting of 100 units or greater to the Village's ability to accommodate the growth in population generated by such TNDs.
1. No building permit for a new residential unit(s) shall be issued unless in accordance with the regulations of this subsection.
2. Once a development schedule is approved in accordance with § 145-28.D.2.j., building permits shall be issued in conformity with that schedule.
3. In determining phasing, the Planning Board shall be guided by the findings of the SEQR review of the proposed developments which shall include an environmental assessment of traffic impacts, economic impacts, and cumulative impacts including developments proposed in surrounding communities and other appropriate studies as determined necessary by the Planning Board. The Planning Board shall be guided by the following criteria:
a. Ability of the Village to adequately serve the proposed development with streets, utilities, drainage, educational, and protective services. TND developers remain responsible for ensuring that water and sewer service needs of the TND-O are adequate and shall construct needed facilities.
b. Other arrangements which will provide for or reduce the cost of public services and facilities such as childcare, health care, elder services, disabled services, recreation, transportation or water conservation.
c. Provisions of housing needs for diverse population groups. Special consideration may be given to the scheduling of developments that include attached units or apartments.
d. Commitments already made in the development schedules for approved developments.
e. Site design, which responds to, incorporates, and protects natural features such as vegetation, topography, watercourses and views, or which is designed to respond to the character of the neighborhood.
M. Ownership/Maintenance
1. Developments within a Traditional Neighborhood Design District may be in either single or multiple ownership. Units and/or lots may be leased or owned separately.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 68
2. At the time of submission of a detailed Site Plan to the Planning Board for approval, the applicant shall be required to prepare and submit a written program for the maintenance of any commonly owned area, including open space and recreation areas, walkways, driveways, parking areas and other common utilities and facilities. This program shall fix the responsibility for the maintenance program on either the landlord or a home association, or a combination thereof, and shall demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Planning Board and the Village Attorney, how such responsibility will be legally bound and enforceable. If authorized and approved by the Village Board, community areas may be dedicated to the Village by the applicant.
3. In the case of multiple ownership of land or buildings, including single-family homes and condominium or cooperative ownership of apartments or townhouses, a homeowners' association shall be formed. Membership in this association shall be required for all owners of dwelling units within the development, and the association shall be responsible for the maintenance program. Where the development is a combination of multiple ownership and leased units, the landlord shall be a member of the homeowners' association with maintenance responsibilities proportional to the number of units which he or she owns.
145-29 Residential Cluster Development.
A. Purposes. The following regulations are intended to apply to land existing within the Village and residentially zoned. Land which is annexed into the Annexation District (AD) shall be subject to Section 27 herein. A subdivision is considered a cluster development when lots and dwelling units are clustered closer together than otherwise permissible in a conventional subdivision and where open space is created on the remainder of the property. Cluster developments are authorized under § 7-738 of New York State Village Law, are encouraged, and where appropriate required, herein. The purposes of residential cluster developments are as follows:
1. To provide greater economy, efficiency and convenience in the siting of services and infrastructure, including the opportunity to reduce road lengths, utility runs, and the amount of paving required;
2. To conserve important unique and sensitive natural features such as steep slopes, floodplains, stream corridors, and wetlands by permanently setting them aside from development;
3. To provide multiple options for landowners to minimize impacts on environmental resources and natural or cultural features such as mature woodlands, hedgerows and tree lines, critical wildlife habitats, historic buildings and sites, and fieldstone walls;
4. To create neighborhoods with a traditional Village character as discussed in the Village’s Comprehensive Plan;
5. To provide for a balanced range of lot sizes, building densities, and housing choices to accommodate a variety of age and income groups and residential preferences, so that Warwick’s population diversity may be maintained;
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 69
6. To implement policies to conserve a variety of irreplaceable and environmentally sensitive resource lands as set forth in the Village Comprehensive Plan, including provisions to create a greenway trail system and other areas for active or passive recreational use for the benefit of present and future residents;
7. To conserve scenic views;
8. To promote development in harmony with the goals and objectives of the Village Comprehensive Plan; and
9. To mitigate identified environmental impacts under the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQR).
B. Authorization. Authorization is hereby granted to the Planning Board to modify applicable provisions of this Zoning Law as to lot size, lot width, depth, yard, and other applicable requirements of the Zoning Law, Subdivision Regulations and Street Specifications, as well as type of residential use, subject to the purposes, standards and procedures contained herein, so as to accommodate Cluster Developments. Prior to filing a formal application for approval of a subdivision, the applicant shall participate in a pre-application conference. The applicant shall make a deposit, in accordance with the Village’s Fee Schedule, sufficient to cover the pre-application expenses required for review by the Village’s professional engineer, planner and attorney.
The Planning Board may require clustering where it finds any one (1) of the following elements present, as determined through review of an Existing Resources Map and Site Analysis Plan as described herein, justifying conservation of natural, cultural or historic resources, scenic features, or preservation of neighborhood character.
1. Slopes: slopes of fifteen percent (15%) or greater on twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the property.
2. Water resources: wetlands, aquifer and aquifer recharge areas, municipal water supply watershed areas, flood-prone areas as shown on Federal Emergency Management Agency maps, or New York State Protected Streams.
3. Agricultural lands: lands within 2,000 feet of a New York State certified Agricultural District.
4. Important Environmental Areas. Lands within or contiguous to areas identified by the Metropolitan Conservation Alliance in the Southern Wallkill Biodiversity Plan (available for the Office of the Village Clerk), areas identified as a Critical Environmental Area designated pursuant to Article 8 of the Environmental Conservation Law or other areas identified by a government agency as important for conservation purposes.
5. Designated open space areas: lands contiguous to publicly owned or designated open space areas or privately owned designated natural areas.
6. Historic structures and sites: historic structures or areas of national, state or local importance.

Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 70
9. Recreation: lakes, ponds or other significant recreational areas, or opportunities or sites designated in the Village Comprehensive Plan.
10. Applicant Request: on lands where the applicant has requested approval of a Cluster Development.
The Planning Board shall require cluster development where it finds any one (1) of the following elements present:
1. Significant natural areas and features: areas with rare vegetation, significant habitats, or habitats of endangered, threatened or special concern species as determined by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (Natural Heritage Program) or the Metropolitan Conservation Alliance’s Southern Wallkill Biodiversity Plan, mature forests over 100 years old, locally important vegetation (such as trees over 24” in diameter at breast height), or unique natural or geological formations.
2. Gateway locations as identified in the Village Comprehensive Plan.
C. Permitted, accessory and special permit uses:
1. Permitted, accessory and special permit uses within a cluster development shall be the same as those otherwise allowed in the zoning district in which the development is located. As an alternative to single-family detached dwellings, two-family, townhouse and multi-family units are also permitted in cluster developments provided common areas are in common or cooperative ownership and subject to review by the Village Attorney. A maximum of 10% of the total number of proposed units may be apartments. A maximum of 25% of the total number of proposed units may be townhouses or two-family units.
2. Open space land as defined in § 145-29.J.
D. Density. Density shall initially be established based on the permitted number of dwelling units that would be permitted if the land were subdivided into lots fully conforming to the minimum lot size and density requirements of this chapter applicable to the district or districts in which such land is situated and conforming to all other requirements of the Village of Warwick Code. To determine density, the applicant shall submit a Yield Plan, designed so that no waivers from any provision of the Village of Warwick Code shall be necessary and meeting the following requirements:
1. Yield Plans shall be prepared as a conceptual sketch plan in accordance with the minimum lot sizes and other development standards for the Zoning district involved.
2. Yield plans shall show proposed lots, streets, rights-of-way, and other pertinent features.
3. The yield subdivision plans shall be realistic and must not show potential house sites or streets in areas that would not ordinarily be legally permitted in a conventional subdivision. All minimum front, side and rear yard requirements must be satisfied by measurement wholly on dry land, except to the extent which may be permitted by any other section of this Zoning Law.
4. Once initial density is established, the total number of permitted dwelling units may be increased to the maximum number of units that will fit on a parcel while maintaining all setbacks required herein and maintaining a minimum lot area of 10,000 square feet. Additional units over the number which was established by the Yield Plan shall be
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 71
subject to a Special Use Permit of the Village Board and shall be subject to a fee established by the Village Board as provided in the Village Schedule of Fees. All payments shall be made prior to the signing of the final subdivision plat.
E. Cluster development design process. The following steps shall constitute the design process for a cluster subdivision:
1. Sketch Plan. A Sketch Plan shall be submitted by the applicant as a diagrammatic basis for informal discussions with the Planning Board regarding the design of a proposed subdivision or land development. The purpose of a sketch plan is to facilitate an expedient review of proposed new subdivisions in conformance with the Village Zoning Law and Comprehensive Plan. Sketch Plan submission is a way to help applicants and Planning Board members develop a better understanding of the property and to help establish an overall design approach that respects its special or noteworthy features and to establish the density permitted under the Zoning Law. To provide a full understanding of the site's potential and to facilitate the most effective exchange with the Planning Board, the Sketch Plan shall include the information listed below.
a. The information required by the Village Subdivision Regulations;
b. 100-year floodplain limits, and approximate location of State and/or Federal wetlands, if any;
c. Topographical and physical features, including existing structures, wooded areas, hedgerows and other significant vegetation, steep slopes (over 15%), soil types, ponds, streams within two hundred (200) feet of the tract, and existing rights-of-way and easements;
d. Schematic layout indicating a general concept for land conservation and development ("bubble" format is acceptable for this delineation of conservation areas); and
e. In the case of land development plans, proposed general layout, including building locations, parking lots, and open spaces.
f. Site Context Map. A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision within its neighborhood context shall be submitted. For all sites, such maps shall be at a scale not less than 1"= 1000', and shall show the relationship of the subject property to natural and man-made features existing within 2,000 feet of the site. The features that shall be shown on Site Context Maps include topography and streams (from USGS maps), State and/or Federal wetlands, woodlands over one-half acre in area (from aerial photographs), ridgelines, public roads and trails, utility easements and rights of way, public land, and land protected under conservation easements.
2. Cluster plan documents. A preliminary Cluster development plan shall consist of and be prepared in accordance with the following requirements, which are designed to supplement and, where appropriate, replace the requirements of the Village of Warwick Subdivision Regulations:
a. Preliminary Plan. The submission requirements for a Preliminary Plan include the requirements for Sketch Plans listed in § 145-29.E(1) above;
b. The submission requirements of the Subdivision Regulations, and;
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 72
c. Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan. For all Cluster developments (except those in which all proposed lots are to be ten or more acres in area), an Existing Resource Plan shall be prepared to provide the developer and the Planning Board with a comprehensive analysis of existing conditions, on the proposed development site.
The Planning Board shall review the Plan to assess its accuracy and thoroughness. Unless otherwise specified by the Planning Board, such plans shall be prepared at the scale of 1"=100' or 1"=200', whichever would fit best on a single standard size sheet. The following information shall be included in this Plan:
(1) Topography, the contour lines of which shall be at two-foot intervals, determined by photogrammetry (although 10-foot intervals are permissible beyond the parcel boundaries, interpolated from published USGS maps). Slopes greater than fifteen percent (15%) shall be clearly indicated. Topography for major subdivisions shall be prepared by a professional land surveyor or professional engineer from an actual field survey of the site or from stereoscopic aerial photography and shall be coordinated with official USGS benchmarks.
(2) The location and delineation of ponds, streams, and natural drainage swales as well as the 100-year floodplains and wetlands, as defined by the State of New York and the US Army Corps of Engineers.
(3) Vegetative cover conditions on the property according to general cover type including cultivated land, permanent grass land, old field, hedgerow, woodland and wetland, isolated trees with a caliper in excess of twelve (12) inches, the actual canopy line of existing trees and woodlands. Vegetative types shall be described by plant community, relative age and condition.
(4) Soil series and types, as mapped by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service in the Orange County Soil Survey.
(5) Ridge lines and watershed boundaries shall be identified, if any exist.
(6) Public roads, public parks, public forests, and other designated open space areas within 1,000 feet of the project site from which the project site may be visible.
(7) Geologic formations on the proposed development parcel, based on available published information or more detailed data obtained by the applicant.
(8) The location and dimensions of all existing streets, roads, buildings, utilities and other man-made improvements on the property.
(9) Locations of all historically significant sites or structures on the tract and on any abutting tract.
(10) Locations of trails that have been in public use (pedestrian, equestrian, bicycle, etc.) or proposed in the Village Comprehensive Plan within 500 feet of the site.
(11) All easements and other encumbrances of property which are or have been filed of record with the Orange County Clerk’s Office shall be shown on the plan.

February 17, 2009 73
3. Four-Step Design Process for Cluster Developments. All sketch plans shall include Step 1 of the four step design process. All preliminary plans shall include documentation of a four-step design process in determining the layout of proposed open space lands, house sites, streets and lot lines, as described below.
Figure 11a. Primary Conservation Areas
a. Step 1: Delineation of Open Space Lands. Proposed open space lands shall be designated using the Existing Resources Plan as a base map and the Subdivision Regulations, dealing with Resource Conservation and Greenway Delineation Standards. The Village’s Comprehensive Plan shall also be considered. Primary Conservation Areas shall be delineated comprising floodplains, wetlands and slopes over twenty-five percent (25%) as shown by example on Figure 11a. Secondary Conservation Areas shall be delineated comprising mature forested areas, significant habitat areas and historic or archeological sensitive sites. The applicant shall prioritize natural and cultural resources on the tract in terms of their highest to least suitability for inclusion in the proposed open space, in consultation with the Planning Board after a site inspection, to create a prioritized list of resources to be conserved.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 74
On the basis of those priorities and practical considerations given to the tract's configuration, its context in relation to resource areas on adjoining and neighboring properties, and the applicant's subdivision objectives, Secondary Conservation Areas shall also be delineated in Step 1 and may be used to meet the minimum area percentage requirements for open space lands. Calculations shall be provided indicating the applicant's compliance with the acreage requirements for open space areas on the tract. The result is shown on Figure 11b, potential development areas.
Figure 11b. Potential Development Areas
b. Step 2: Location of House Sites. Potential house sites shall be tentatively located (see Figure 12), using the proposed open space lands as a base map as well as other relevant data on the Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan such as topography and soils. Dwelling units should generally be located not closer than 100 feet from Primary Conservation Areas and 50 feet from Secondary Conservation Areas, taking into consideration the potential negative impacts of residential development on such areas as well as the potential positive benefits of such locations to provide attractive views and visual settings for residences.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 75
Figure 12. House Sites
c. Step 3: Alignment of Streets. Upon designating the house sites, a street plan shall be designed to provide vehicular access to each house, complying with the standards identified herein and bearing a logical relationship to topographic conditions as illustrated in Figure 13. Impacts of the street plan on proposed open space lands shall be minimized, particularly with respect to crossing environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands and traversing slopes exceeding 15%. Existing and future street connections are encouraged to eliminate the number of new cul-de-sacs to be maintained by the Village and to facilitate access to and from homes in different parts of the tract and adjoining parcels. Cul-de-sacs are appropriate only when they support greater open space conservation or provide pedestrian linkages.
d. Step 4: Drawing In the Lot Lines. Upon completion of the preceding three steps, lot lines are drawn as required to delineate the boundaries of individual residential lots – see Figure 14.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 76
Figure 13. Aligning Streets and Trails
Figure 14. Drawing the Lot Lines
e. Where traditional streetscapes and "terminal vistas" are of great importance, Steps Two
and Three may be reversed, so that streets and squares are located during the second
step, and house sites are located immediately thereafter. The first step is to identify open
space lands, including both Primary and Secondary Conservation Areas.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 77
F. Dimensional Standards. The Planning Board shall have the discretion to modify the applicable bulk and dimensional standards from that which is required in a conventional subdivision except that lots shall maintain the following minimum standards:
1. Minimum required open space: In all zoning districts, a cluster development must preserve twenty percent (20%) of the tract’s developed acreage as open space land. Parking areas and roads shall not be included in the calculation of the minimum required open space.
2. Minimum lot width at building line: 50 feet.
3. Yard regulations: the builder or developer is urged to consider variations in the principal building position and orientation, but shall observe the following minimum standards:
Front Yard: 15 feet
Rear Yard: 25 feet
Side Yard: 10 feet separation for principal buildings.
4. Maximum Impervious coverage. No more than thirty five (35%) of any lot shall be covered with impervious surface.
5. Minimum lot size. The minimum lot size shall be ten thousand (10,000) square feet per single-family unit. Attached or townhouse style units shall be condominium, cooperative, or other acceptable ownership options. A minimum of 5,000 square feet per attached two-family, or apartment unit shall be provided.
G. Open space standards:
1. The required open space land may consist of a combination of Primary Conservation Areas and Secondary Conservation Areas as described above. The proposed subdivision design shall strictly minimize disturbance of these environmentally sensitive areas. Primary Conservation Areas shall be included in the required open space area to the greatest extent practical. The applicant shall also demonstrate that such features will be protected by the proposed subdivision plan. Secondary Conservation Areas include special features of the property that would ordinarily be overlooked or ignored during the design process such as significant habitat areas, mature forests, historic structures and sites and archeological sensitive areas. Secondary Conservation Areas shall be included in the required open space area to the greatest extent practical such that protecting these resources will, in the judgment of the Planning Board, achieve the purposes of this section.
2. Open space lands shall be laid out in general accordance with the Village Comprehensive Plan to better enable an interconnected network of open space.
3. A recreational fee in lieu of land, as set forth in the Village’s fee schedule, shall be imposed to accommodate the foreseeable recreational needs of the proposed subdivision’s residents. Upon the recommendation of the Planning Board and where the Village Board of Trustees deems it appropriate for land to be deeded for recreational purposes, up to ten percent (10%) of the total acreage may be subject to the Village’s recreational land dedication requirement. Typically, this acreage will be used to provide potential connections within the Village’s long-range trail network.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 78
4. Active agricultural land with farm buildings may be used to meet the minimum required open space land when part of a parent parcel. Access to open space land used for agriculture may be appropriately restricted for public safety and to prevent interference with agricultural operations. Land used for agricultural purposes shall be buffered from residential uses, either bordering or within the tract, by a minimum setback of at least 75 feet and if practical three hundred (300) feet deep. No clearing of trees or understory growth shall be permitted in this setback (except as may be necessary for street or trail construction). Where this buffer is unwooded, the Planning Board may require vegetative screening to be planted, or that it be managed to encourage natural forest succession through “no-mow” policies and the periodic removal of invasive alien plant and tree species.
5. Open space land should generally remain undivided and connect to areas of adjacent open space where applicable.
6. No portion of any house lot may be used for meeting the minimum required open space land unless encumbered with a conservation restriction.
H. House lot standards. Development areas for the location of house lots include the necessary building envelope for each dwelling unit, constituting the remaining lands of the tract outside of the designated open space areas. House lots shall be designed in accordance with the following standards:
1. House lots shall not encroach upon Primary Conservation Areas and their layout shall respect Secondary Conservation Areas.
2. All new dwellings shall meet the following setback requirements to the greatest extent practicable:
a. From agricultural lands either bordering or within the tract 75 feet
b. From buildings or barnyards housing livestock 300 feet
c. From active recreation areas such as courts or playing fields (not including tot lots) 150 feet
3. House lots shall, to the greatest extent practical, be accessed from interior streets, rather than from roads bordering the tract.
4. Dwellings should be generally orientated towards the street. Front setbacks should be similar to those in surrounding existing neighborhoods, but in no case should exceed 40 feet unless specifically authorized by the Planning Board.
5. Maximum lot development coverage shall remain that which is required for the particular use in the zone as shown the Table of Bulk Requirements in Section 145-41.
I. Streets and driveways.
1. Proposed streets shall meet the Village Street Specifications, unless access arrangements have been made in accordance with § 7-732 of New York State Village Law. New intersections with existing public roads shall be minimized. Although two access ways into and out of subdivisions containing twenty (20) or more dwellings are generally required for safety, proposals for more than two entrances onto public roads shall be discouraged if they would unnecessarily disrupt traffic flow or unduly impact the environment. Regardless of the street design employed, the applicant shall demonstrate
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 79
and the Planning Board shall find that emergency services access is adequate for the number of dwellings proposed.
2. Straight segments connected by 90 degree and 135 degree bends are preferred.
3. The use of reverse curves should be considered for local access streets in Cluster developments in conjunction with long horizontal curve radii (at least 250 feet) and where traffic speeds will not exceed 25 mph.
4. Sidewalks shall be required on proposed streets and shall tie into the existing sidewalk system of the Village where applicable. Street trees shall be required in accordance with Chapter 131 of the Village Code. Depending upon the open or wooded character of the parcel the Planning Board may waive street tree requirements.
J. Permanent protection of open space. Conservation easements are the preferred method to protect open space under Article 49 of the New York State Environmental Conservation Law. In all cases, the permanent preservation of such open space shall be legally assured to the satisfaction of the Planning Board and Village Attorney and the Village Board shall be granted third party enforcement rights to enforce the terms of the conservation restriction. The following regulations shall apply:
1. If a conservation easements is proposed, the conservation easement shall be titled to a private conservation organization provided that:
a. The conservation organization is acceptable to the Village and is a bona fide conservation organization as defined in Article 49 of the New York State Environmental Conservation Law;
b. The conveyance contains appropriate provisions for proper reverter or retransfer in the event that the conservation organization becomes unwilling or unable to continue carrying out its functions; and
c. A maintenance agreement acceptable to the Village is established between the owner and the conservation organization to insure perpetual maintenance of the open space.
2. The conservation restriction shall permanently restrict the open space from future subdivision, shall define the range of permitted activities, and shall give the Village the ability to enforce these restrictions. Under no circumstances shall any development be permitted in the open space at any time, except for the following uses:
a. Conservation of open land in its natural state (for example, woodland, fallow field, or managed meadow). The clearing of woodland shall generally be prohibited, except as necessary to create trails and active recreation facilities. The determination of necessity shall lie with the Planning Board.
b. Game preserve, wildlife sanctuary, or other similar conservation use.
c. Woodlots, arboreta, agriculture and silviculture in keeping with established standards for best management practices, selective harvesting, and sustained-yield forestry.
d. Neighborhood open space uses such as village greens, commons, picnic areas, community gardens, trails, and similar low-impact passive recreational uses specifically excluding motorized off-road vehicles, rifle ranges, and other uses similar in character and potential impact as determined by the Planning Board.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 80
e. Active non-commercial recreation areas, such as playing fields, playgrounds, and courts, provided such areas do not consume more than half of the minimum required open space land or five acres, whichever is less. Playing fields, playgrounds, and courts shall not be located within 150 feet of abutting properties nor shall such facilities be equipped with lighting. Parking facilities for the same shall also be permitted, and they shall generally be gravel-surfaced, unlighted, properly drained, provide safe ingress and egress, and contain no more than ten parking spaces. Such recreation uses may be a public park or recreation area owned and operated by a public or private nonprofit agency, but shall not include storage of materials, trucking or repair facilities, or private or municipal sanitary landfills.
f. Stormwater detention areas designed, landscaped, and available for use as an integral part of the open space area.
g. Easements for drainage; access, sewer or water lines, or other public purposes.
h. Underground utility rights-of-way. Above ground utility and street rights-of-way may traverse conservation areas but shall not count toward the minimum required open space land.
K. Ownership of open space land and common facilities. The following methods may be used, either individually or in combination, for ownership of open space land (exclusive of its conservation easement) and common facilities. Open space trails may be initially offered for dedication to the Village. Open space land and common facilities shall not be transferred to another entity except for transfer to another method of ownership permitted under this section. Ownership methods shall conform to the following:
1. Fee simple dedication to the Village. The Village may, but shall not be required to, accept any portion of the open space land and common facilities, provided that:
a. There is no substantial cost of acquisition to the Village; and
b. The Village agrees to and has access to maintain such facilities; and
c. Such facilities shall be accessible for public use.
2. Homeowners‟ Association. Open space land and common facilities may be held in common ownership by a homeowners‟ association, subject to all of the provisions for homeowners‟ associations set forth in New York State regulations. In addition, the following regulations shall be met:
a. The applicant shall provide the Village with a description of the organization of the proposed association, including its by-laws, and all documents governing ownership, maintenance, and use restrictions for common facilities.
b. The proposed association shall be established by the owner or applicant and shall be operating (with financial subsidization by the owner or applicant, if necessary) before the sale of any dwelling units in the development.
c. Membership in the association shall be mandatory for each property owner within the subdivision and successive owners in title with voting rights of one vote per lot or unit, and the subdivider’s control, therefore, passing to the individual lot/unit owners on sale of the majority of the lots or units.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 81
d. The association shall be responsible for liability insurance, local taxes and maintenance of open space land, recreational facilities and other commonly held facilities.
e. The by-laws shall confer legal authority on the association to place a lien on the real property of any member who falls delinquent in his or her dues. Such dues shall be paid with the accrued interest before the lien may be lifted.
f. Written notice of any proposed transfer of common facilities by the association or the assumption of maintenance for common facilities must be given to all members of the association and to the Village no less than thirty (30) days prior to such event.
g. The association shall have adequate resources to administer, maintain, and operate such common facilities.
3. Non-common private ownership. The required open space land may be included within one or more large “conservancy lots” provided the open space is permanently restricted from future development.
4. Other instruments, such as deed restriction acceptable to the Village Attorney, may also be used to protect open space as may be proposed by the applicant.
L. Maintenance. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Village Board, the cost and responsibility of maintaining common open space and facilities shall be borne by the homeowners‟ association, conservation organization, private owner, or, in the case of open space and facilities deeded to the Village, the municipality.

145-67 Stormwater Management And Erosion And Sediment Control
A. Findings. The purpose of this section of the Zoning Law is to establish minimum requirements for the control of stormwater, soil erosion and sedimentation of surface waters to protect and safeguard the general health, safety and welfare of the residents and to address the following findings:
1. Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition.
2. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species.
3. Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat.
4. Improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation.
5. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow.
6. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the Village.
7. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities.
8. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 102
pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety.
9. Regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.
B. Purposes. Establishing minimum stormwater management requirements and controls will address the findings of fact cited above by achieving the following purposes:
1. Require land development activities to conform to the substantive requirements of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) General Permit for Construction Activities GP-02-01 or as amended or revised;
2. Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development activities in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels;
3. Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land development activities which would otherwise degrade local water quality;
4. Minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to the maximum extent practicable; and
5. Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management practices and to ensure that these management practices are properly maintained and eliminate threats to public safety.
6. The goal of New York State's stormwater management program is to retain or absorb stormwater on the developed site with the quantity, rate and quality of runoff remaining the same as the pre-development condition. The Village of Warwick's goal is to exceed this goal by 10% for rate so that extra capacity is designed in the stormwater management facilities to accommodate minor changes in the impervious cover which frequently occur overtime and after development approvals have been received.
C. Applicability. This Subsection shall be applicable to all land development activities as defined herein. All land development activities subject to review and approval by the Planning Board under subdivision, Site Plan, conditional use and/or special permit regulations shall be reviewed subject to the standards contained in this local law. The Village of Warwick designates the Code Enforcement Officer (CEO) for acceptance of all stormwater pollution prevention plans (SWPPP) and directs the CEO to forward such plans to the Planning Board and Village Engineer. The Planning Board, as part of the Subdivision, Site Plan and Special Use Permit review processes required by this Chapter, may review the plans and may engage the services of a professional engineer to review the plans, specifications and related documents at a cost not to exceed the amount specified in the fee schedule established by the Village Board.

ARTICLE VII Parking and Loading
145-70 Off-Street Parking and Loading Requirements
A. Purpose. The Village of Warwick finds that large and highly visible parking areas can damage the scenic and historic character of the community, can encourage vehicle travel while discouraging travel by foot, bicycle and public transit and can therefore increase energy consumption, traffic congestion, and air pollution and reduce the quality of life. The Village of Warwick wishes to promote public transit while reducing the cost of housing and encourages applicants to limit the number of parking spaces provided. Therefore, the parking standards provided herein are recommended maximums. The purpose of the off-street parking and loading regulations is to ensure
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 115
that such uses are treated as accessory uses, are adequate to serve design day needs, do not predominate the site, are placed to the side and rear of buildings to minimize their visibility, and feature quality landscaping and architecture to reduce the visual impact of glare, headlights, and parking lot lights from streets and neighboring properties. Off-street parking areas should compliment the buildings on a site, improve the appearance of the Village of Warwick, protect the character of residential, business, institutional, and industrial areas, and conserve the value of land and buildings on surrounding properties.
1. Parking Space Requirements. Permanent off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided in all districts in accordance with the standards set forth below as follows:
a. When any new building or structure is erected;
b. When any existing building or structure is enlarged or increased in capacity;
c. When adding dwelling units, guest rooms, seats or floor area to an existing or lawfully approved structure;
d. When a new use is established;
e. When an existing use is changed to another use;
f. When a new business activity is added;
g. When there is a change of ownership; or
h. When there is a change of tenant.
2. Permitted accessory uses. Off-street parking spaces, open or enclosed, are permitted accessory to any use, subject to the provisions of this section. Off-street loading berths, open or enclosed, are permitted accessory to any use except residences for one or two families. No off-street loading berth shall be located in a front yard.
3. Schedule of requirements.
a. The accessory off-street parking and loading spaces specified by the recommended generation rates below are to be used as guidelines by the Planning Board in the development of sufficient but not excessive parking for proposed uses. A written report, defining and documenting the feasibility of an increase in spaces, shall be submitted by a qualified parking consultant and approved by the Planning Board. Any land which is developed as a unit under single ownership and control shall be considered a single lot for the purpose of these standards. The final number and layout of parking spaces shall be determined by the Planning Board based on the need to protect public safety and convenience while minimizing harm to the character of the community and to scenic historic, and environmental resources. In determining the parking requirements for any proposed use, the Planning Board shall consider the Schedule of Parking Space Standards, together with the following criteria:
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 116
(1) The number of persons who would be parking at the use as employees, customers, clients, members, students or other users, at times of typical peak daily usage and not for seasonal highest volume.
(2) The size of the structure(s) and the site.
(3) The scenic and/or historic sensitivity of the site.
(4) The distance and access to public transit or the potential for ridesharing.
(5) The potential for shared parking, where peak-parking accumulation can be accommodated at different times of the day, week or season by nearby land uses. Shared parking should be examined in relation to the availability of such off-site, off-street parking existing within 300 feet of the site. Shared parking must be either open to the public, owned or controlled by the applicant, or where a deeded right to shared use has been demonstrated by the applicant.
(6) The potential for staggered hours of use, in the case of a combination of uses on a single parcel, to reduce the parking requirements. The applicant shall legally assure, to the satisfaction of the Planning Board and Village Attorney, how staggered hours of operation will continue for the life of the uses.
(7) The parking space generation rates may be increased by the Planning Board where an applicant demonstrates that the particular development characteristics of the proposed land use requires a greater number of spaces than specified herein. Such demonstration shall include documentation of parking experience elsewhere through surveys of demand and problems at existing uses that may be applicable and/or a study of patterns of local automobile use that shows adjustments in design day peaks are needed. The Planning Board may require applicants to address alternatives for reducing vehicle use, parking demand and housing costs by limiting the number of parking spaces to less than the maximums identified herein.

b. Reasonable and appropriate off-street parking and loading requirements for structures and uses which do not fall within the categories listed above shall be determined by the Planning Board upon consideration of all factors entering into the parking needs of each such use. The Planning Board remains responsible for balancing the need for adequate parking with the need to avoid the negative impacts of excessive parking.
c. Special care is required for development of impervious surfaces in the Wawayanda Creek Aquifer (see Comprehensive Plan Map #5 and § 145-67 for the Village of Warwick Stormwater Management Regulations). All surfacing, grading and drainage shall facilitate groundwater recharge by minimizing impervious pavement and all peak or overflow parking areas shall be permeable. Maximum use of pervious paving materials for parking areas shall be required except in
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 119
cases of unusual or extraordinary difficulties due to exceptional conditions of topography, access, location, shape, or other physical features of the site. The use of rooftop gardens or green roofs for buildings with flat roofs is encouraged.
The Planning Board is authorized to approve parking reserve areas which may not be constructed until and unless demand is evident. The Planning Board may, as a condition of allowing parking reserve areas, require an applicant to set aside (or to “bank”) land to meet potential future parking needs. Such land shall remain in its natural state or be landscaped, but may not be used in a manner that would prevent it from being developed for parking in the future. Reserve areas shall be clearly identified on Site Plans approved under Article XI. A deed restriction shall be executed guaranteeing that the owner will provide the additional spaces if the Code Enforcement Officer, upon thorough investigation of the actual use of parking spaces at the building or use, recommends to the Planning Board that the approved reduction be modified or revoked.
d. Definitions. As used in this chapter, the following definitions shall govern the interpretation of the parking regulations. The uses enumerated and similar uses not specifically defined may be located as stand-alone facilities (in separate buildings), combined in buildings generally housing a number of similar uses or located in mixed-use facilities where a wide range of non-related uses may be combined in a single building, or development complex.
EMPLOYEE. Shall mean the regular working staff, (paid, volunteer or otherwise) at maximum strength and in full time equivalent numbers necessary to operate, maintain or service any given facility or use under normal levels of service.
GARAGE, PRIVATE. An accessory building housing motor vehicles (not more than one (1) of which may be a commercial vehicle of not more than three (3) tons gross vehicle weight) which are the property of and for the private use of the occupants of the parcel on which the private garage is located.
GARAGE, PUBLIC. Any building or premise (except those used as a private garage or off-street parking facility) used for equipping, repairing, hiring, selling or storing motor vehicles.
GROSS FLOOR AREA. The term "gross floor area" (GFA) as used herein shall mean the gross floor area, including the exterior building walls, of all floors of a building or structure. GFA shall include all occupiable areas minus the following deductions:
[1] Vehicular parking and loading areas within the structure.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 120
[2] Floor area occupied by HVAC (heating, ventilating and air conditioning), mechanical, electrical, communications and security equipment or apparatus.
GROSS LEASABLE AREA. The term "gross leasable area" (GLA) as used herein shall mean the gross floor area minus the following floor area deductions:
[1] Elevator shafts and stairways
[2] Public restrooms
[3] Public lobbies, common mall areas, atriums and courtyards provided solely for pedestrian access to the building from the exterior, and/or for aesthetic enhancement or natural lighting purposes.
[4] Permanently designated corridors (i.e. not subject to relocation by the requirements of a specific lease).
OCCUPIED SPACE. An area enclosed or covered providing a ceiling height of 7' 0" or more, intended for normal use by people on an occasional or more frequent basis. Occupied space may include basements, cellars, penthouses, attic space and interior balconies or mezzanines if the space is intended for use or habitation.
OFF-STREET PARKING FACILITY. Parking spaces located in an area other than on a street or public right-of-way and limited in use to vehicles not exceeding a gross vehicle weight of three (3) tons or not parked continuously for periods of more than forty-eight (48) hours, except in facilities designated for special uses such as airport parking. Parking facilities include the following sub-classes:
[1] SURFACE PARKING LOT. A parking facility constructed on prepared grade and without a covering roof or structure.
[2] OPEN PARKING STRUCTURE. A parking area or facility, comprising one or more floors as a part or whole of a building, that meets the requirements for natural ventilation as specified by the New York State Building Code.
[3] ENCLOSED PARKING STRUCTURE. A parking area or facility comprising one or more floors as a part or whole of a building, that does not meet adopted Building Code requirements for openness.
4. Areas computed as parking spaces. Areas which may be computed as open or enclosed off-street parking spaces include any private garage, carport or other area available for parking, other than street or a driveway except in the Traditional Neighborhood District. A driveway for a one-family or two-family residence may count as one parking space, other than on a corner lot, where the visibility at intersections is to be safeguarded.
5. Location of Parking Spaces. All off-street parking shall be located behind or to the side of the principal building(s) except as permitted by § 145-71.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 121
Parking spaces shall be screened from public view to the maximum extent practicable, provided such screening does not interfere with safety standards for sight distance. The Planning Board is authorized to reduce applicable front yard setbacks to allow placement of buildings nearer to the street, when parking is provided wholly at the rear of buildings and to link the site to the streetfront and sidewalk systems, whether existing or planned. Recommended parking dimensions are shown in the illustration below:
6. Access. Unobstructed access to and from a street shall be provided. Such access shall consist of at least one ten-foot lane for parking areas with fewer than 20 spaces and at least two ten-foot lanes for parking areas with 20 spaces or more.
7. Drainage and surfacing. All open parking areas shall be properly drained, and all such areas shall be provided with a suitable surface as specified by the Planning Board. See § 145-70.A(3)(c) for special conditions that apply to parking areas in the Wawayanda Creek Aquifer.
8. Landscaping. Parking lot landscaping is in addition to all other landscaping requirements of the Zoning Law. See § 145-91.E for landscaping requirements of all uses requiring conditional use permits, special permits and/or Site Plan approval. In all parking lots providing eight (8) or more off-street parking spaces, at least fifteen percent (15%) of the area between the inside perimeter of the parking surface of the parking area shall be landscaped and maintained with trees, shrubs and other plant materials, as determined necessary by the
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 122
Planning Board. Natural landscaping can count as part of the fifteen percent (15%) requirement. In all parking lots providing eight (8) or more off-street parking spaces, a minimum of one canopy tree having a caliper of at least three inches (3”) in diameter at breast height (dbh) and 10 shrubs shall be planted for each eight (8) parking spaces and any additional portion thereof, said tree(s) to be planted in median dividers, landscape islands or such other locations as may be determined by the Planning Board to relieve the monotonous expanse of asphalt and provide shade for parked vehicles.
The following principles of off-street parking lot design shall be considered in developing a landscape plan. It is recognized that each site is different due to topography, the presence of surface water resources, and other factors such as snow removal. Therefore, while the use of all principles is encouraged in parking lot design, each may not be attainable on every site.
(a) Use of native species is highly encouraged since such species are tolerant of Southeastern New York’s climate, generally disease resistant, do not create unusual maintenance problems, and are readily available from local nurseries. Use a variety of tree species to provide visual interest, to protect against same species die-out or disease, and be tolerant of road salt. Large leafed and/or fruiting trees should be avoided.
(b) To reduce the visual impact of the parking lot, provide a ten (10) foot wide landscape strip around the perimeter of the lot, to be planted with shade trees and low shrubs. Provide a minimum of one shade tree every 35 feet of lot perimeter but not necessarily at 35 feet on-center. In the judgment of the Planning Board, additional shade trees and sufficient shrubs may be necessary to effectively shade/screen the parking lot.
(c) Break up the blacktop and reduce stormwater runoff by using bricks, pavers, or textured surfaces for crosswalks. For uses subject to seasonal fluctuations, establish overflow parking using pervious surfaces such as cellular concrete blocks where the interstices of the blocks are filled with earth and planted with grass. The Planning Board remains responsible for determination of the adequacy of parking supply demand.
(d) Divide the rows of parking with planting strips and trees, averaging a tree every six (6) to ten (10) spaces. Planting strips should be a minimum of eight (8) feet in width.
(e) Provide diamond shaped tree islands six (6) feet wide for every four (4) to six (6) parking stalls.
(f) Reduce visual impacts by breaking up large parking lots into smaller parking groves and parking courts with a significant number of shade trees and surrounded by low hedges, stone walls, or attractive fencing. Avoid more than 10 parking spaces in a continuous row and more than 30 spaces in any single parking area defined by landscaping.
(g) Create large planting islands (over 500 square feet) to be located throughout the lot and planted with shade trees, low shrubs, and/or
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 123
ground cover. These should preferably be located at the ends of parking rows.
(h) Provide planting islands between every 15 spaces to avoid long rows of parked cars. Each of these planting islands should provide at least one shade tree.
(i) Landscaping should be used to delineate vehicular and pedestrian patterns. Clear and legible signs, different color and texture paving materials, raised or inverted areas, and other techniques should be used to further direct the flow of both vehicular and pedestrian traffic within the lot.
(j) Use existing woodlands, if located on the site, by preserving as much as possible along the perimeter of the lot. Provide additional evergreen shrubs if needed.
(k) At least twenty-five percent (25%) of the shade trees should be evergreen type.
(l) The use of non-plant materials as part of the landscape plan is encouraged, especially where such materials exist on the subject site. These materials may include the following: large landscape quality boulders, water features, wood or concrete soil retaining devices, gravels, concrete garden amenities, and approved mulch materials.
(m) Lighting should compliment the landscaping and architectural features on the site, should be distinctive and human scale, and should avoid excessive glare or wasted light.
(n) In large parking lots, separate pedestrian walkways should be provided to allow safe movement within the lots. These facilities should generally be oriented perpendicular to and between parking bays. Adjacent to the walks, trees should be planted. Coordinate pedestrian walkways with access for public transit if available or planned. The following walkway guidelines also apply:
[1] One walkway can serve as a collector for up to four bays of parked cars.
[2] The walkway should be a minimum of four feet wide, allowing an additional 30 inches on each side for overhanging of automobiles.
[3] All walkways should be raised to a standard sidewalk height and should be constructed of different paving material than the parking lot.
[4] Provide pedestrian and bicycle amenities such as benches, shade, human scale lighting, and bicycle racks.
(o) All plant material used to landscape parking lots is to be maintained at all times in a living and growing condition. The property owner is responsible for regular weeding, mowing of grass, irrigating, fertilizing, pruning, and other maintenance of all planting as needed. Any plant that dies shall be replaced with another living plant that complies with
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 124
the approved Site Plan within thirty (30) days, or as soon as practical given weather conditions, after notification by the Village Code Enforcement Officer. A three (3) year maintenance bond shall be provided to ensure successful planting.
9. Joint facilities. Required parking spaces, open or enclosed, may be provided in spaces designed to serve jointly two or more establishments whether or not located on the same lot, in accordance with the standards defined in § 145-70.A(3).
10. Design Standards.
(a) Parking facilities shall be designed with regard for orderly management, topography, landscaping, ease of access, and shall be developed as an integral part of an overall site design.
(b) Parking spaces shall have wheel stops or curbs to prevent injury to trees and shrubs planted in landscaped islands.
(c) Bicycle parking spaces and racks shall be provided in an area that does not conflict with vehicular traffic. Designated van/car pool parking, and other facilities for transportation alternatives to single occupancy vehicle use shall be provided wherever practical.
(d) All above-ground loading facilities shall be oriented to preserve auditory privacy between adjacent buildings, and shall be screened from public view to the extent necessary to eliminate unsightliness.
(e) Parking areas shall comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. All handicapped parking spaces shall be designed in accordance with the American National Standard Institute, Inc. Standards for Making Buildings and Facilities Accessible To and Usable by Physically Handicapped People (ANSI A117.1-1980 or as amended). The minimum width for the vehicle space shall be ten (10) feet and shall have an adjacent access aisle. The minimum width of an access aisle serving car parking shall be five (5) feet. The minimum width of an access aisle serving van parking shall be eight (8) feet. The number of handicapped parking spaces shall be provided according to the Table 8 - Required Accessible Parking Spaces below.

11. Screening from residential uses.
(a) Whenever a parking lot abuts the side or rear lot line of a lot in a residence district, or any land in residential use, said parking lot shall be effectively screened from such adjoining lot by a substantial fence, or berm, or a thick evergreen hedge as determined by the Planning Board, with a height of not less than six (6) feet at the time of planting and pruned to a height of not less than six and one-half (6½) feet.
(b) Whenever a parking lot is located across the street from land in any residence district, or any land in residential use, it shall be screened from the view of such land by a thick hedge located along a line drawn parallel to the street and a distance of five feet from the edge of pavement or greater in order to maintain adequate sight distance, such hedge to be interrupted only at points of ingress and egress. The open area between such hedge and the street shall be landscaped in harmony with the landscaping prevailing on neighboring properties fronting on the same street.
(c) Identification and directional signs located on the street side of such screening as provided in Article VIII shall not exceed an area of two (2) square feet each and shall be limited to such number as are essential for the particular use.
12. Trailers (camping or travel), boats, and commercial vehicles not exceeding twenty-six (26) feet in length.
(a) One (1) house trailer, recreational vehicle or boat trailer not exceeding twenty-six (26) feet in length may only be parked or stored on any developed residential lot and must be behind the front setback line of any required yard. The use of such a vehicle for dwelling purposes is prohibited. All other parking storage or use of such vehicles is prohibited, except that:
[1] One (1) house trailer, recreational vehicle or boat trailer not exceeding twenty-six (26) feet in length may only be parked or
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 126
stored on any developed residential lot and must be behind the front setback line of any required yard. All other parking storage or use of such vehicles is prohibited. The use of such a vehicle for dwelling purposes is prohibited.
[2] No house trailer, recreational vehicle or boat may be stored on an unimproved lot.
[3] One commercial vehicle not exceeding 26 feet in length may be parked within a private garage in any residence district.
13. Driveways. No driveway shall provide access to a lot located in another district, which lot is used for any use prohibited in the district in which such driveway is located.
B. Additional requirements for off-street loading berths.
1. Accessory open or enclosed off-street loading berths shall be provided for any lot or any use as specified herein. Any land which is developed as a unit under single ownership and control shall be considered a single lot for the purpose of such requirements.
2. Size, location and access. Each required loading berth shall be at least 12 feet wide, 33 feet long and 14 feet high, unless specified elsewhere for a particular use. Unobstructed access, at least 10 feet wide, to and from a street shall be provided. Such access may be combined with access to a parking lot. The berth may be located either within a building or in the open, but not within required yards. If such berths are not enclosed, they shall be located not less than 300 feet from any residence district boundary and an effective visual and noise barrier shall be provided as in the case of parking areas as set forth in § 145-70A(10).
C. Regulations affecting both parking and loading facilities.
1. Access near street corners. No entrance or exit for any accessory off-street parking area with over 10 parking spaces, nor any loading berth, shall be located within 50 feet of the intersection of any two street lines.
2. On lots divided by district boundaries. When a lot is located partly in one district and partly in another district, the regulations for the district requiring the greater number of parking spaces or loading berths shall apply to all of the lot. Parking spaces or loading berths on such a lot may be located without regard to district lines, provided that no such parking spaces or loading berths shall be located in any residence district, unless the use to which they are accessory is permitted in such district.

145-91 Objectives and Design Standards
In considering and acting upon Site Plans, the Planning Board and the AHDRB shall take into consideration the Public Health, Safety and Welfare, the comfort and convenience of the public in general and of the prospective occupants of the proposed development and of the immediate neighborhood in particular and may prescribe such appropriate conditions and safeguards as may be required in order to further the expressed intent of this chapter and accomplish the following objectives in particular:
A. Environment - The design, layout and operation characteristics of the proposed use will not represent significant impact on the environment or result in a waste of the land and other natural resources of the Village. To the greatest possible extent, development will be in harmony with the natural environment and adequate compensatory devices will be prescribed to offset potential significant deterioration resulting from the project.
B. Development - The Site Plan elements, including buildings, parking, drainage, pedestrian and vehicle circulation, signs and lighting, will not adversely affect the
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 145
potential of adjacent properties or the property under review from its highest and best use.
C. Compatibility – Architecture that is compatible with the character and scale of the surrounding neighborhood. This includes building size, height, massing and appearance. Signage and lighting will be compatible and in scale with building elements and will not predominate the overall visual impact of the project. Textures of buildings and paved areas will be sufficiently varied to prevent a massive or monolithic appearance, particularly areas of asphalted paving for parking. Stone walls, historic structures, natural features like mature trees and other historically significant structures shall be considered during the site plan review process.
D. Pedestrian circulation – Sidewalk facilities, including provisions for street trees, will be provided including connections to adjacent properties. The development plan should also consider additional pedestrian facilities such as benches and tables if compatible with the use and site location.
E. Landscaping and screening - All recreation areas, parking and service areas will be reasonably screened from the view of adjacent residential lots and streets in all seasons of the year. The following general landscaping principles will be considered during site plan review:
1. The site plan has integrated natural features, such as mature trees, rock outcrops, streams, slopes or stone walls into the design of the plan.
2. Low maintenance native plants have been incorporated to reinforce the character of the region.
3. Plantings along the public frontage, especially street trees and continuous landscaping, reinforce the flow of the street and/or bridges gaps between buildings.
4. A diversity of plant species has been proposed and there is a combination of trees and low plantings to create contrasting forms.
5. Landscaping has been used to frame views of architecture or open vistas.
6. Consideration has been given to establishing an open space system on the site which connects to the surrounding natural area or landscaping on the adjoining parcel.
7. Enforceable maintenance agreements have been offered to ensure long-term viability of the landscaping plan.
8. Trees and shrubs will not obstruct the use of sidewalks, roads, or other pathways.
F. Traffic access - All proposed traffic accesses will be adequate but not excessive in number; adequate in width, grade, alignment and visibility; not located near street corners or other major access points; and other similar safety considerations.
G. Circulation and parking - Adequate off-street parking and loading spaces will be provided to prevent parking of vehicles on public streets. The interior circulation system will be adequate to provide safe accessibility to all required off-street parking.
H. Architecture - Excessive uniformity, dissimilarity, poor quality of design or building out of context with the surroundings can have a remarkably disruptive effect on the
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 146
visual character of the Village. It effects nearby buildings, the streetscape, and the image of the Village as a whole. The exterior appearance of buildings erected in any neighborhood can adversely affect the desirability of the immediate area and the neighborhood for residential, business and other purposes. The stability and value of both improved and unimproved property can be detrimentally affected. All new buildings and redevelopment of existing buildings will avoid excessive uniformity, dissimilarity, or poor quality of design and will be built in context with the surroundings.
I. Design Standards - The purpose of good site design is to create a functional and attractive development, to minimize adverse impacts, and to ensure that a development project will be an asset to the community. To promote this purpose the Planning Board, in reviewing site plans, shall consider the standards set forth below. Such standards are intended to provide a framework within which the designer of the development is free to exercise creativity, invention and innovation while recognizing the Village’s scenic and historic qualities. The Planning Board may require submission of alternative design and layout proposals based on the standards in this section:

145-120.3 Home Occupations
A. Purposes. Home occupations can provide numerous benefits for Village residents and the Village as a whole. They can provide useful services while encouraging business growth by eliminating the initial need for some small businesses to rent commercial space. Working at home can save energy resources that would be needed to commute and can reduce traffic congestion. Home occupations can also provide many people who might be unable to work outside the home (such as the elderly, single parents or the disabled) an opportunity to earn a living. The regulations contained herein are designed to provide flexibility to potential residents who wish to establish a home occupation. The regulations are not designed to allow a business that has outgrown the limited space available to operate a home occupation within someone’s residence, when such businesses should instead relocate to a commercial space.
B. Authorization. In any district, except for the PAC Zone, where a dwelling exists or where otherwise specified in the Zoning Law, a home occupation, as defined in § 145-181, may be established in conformance with the following use limitations:
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 181
1. A home occupation may only be conducted within a dwelling unit which is a bona fide and principal residence of the owner, lessee or other persons who occupy or reside in the dwelling, or in an accessory building thereto which has been approved for use as a home occupation and for which a Certificate of Occupancy has been issued by the Code Enforcement Office. The application for home occupation must bear the signed approval of the owner of the property. For purposes of this Chapter, a home occupation occurring fully within the dwelling shall be considered a Class 1 home occupation and is subject to the issuance of a Conditional Use permit by the Planning Board and Site Plan approval in accordance with § 145-90. Those home occupations occurring wholly or partially in an accessory building, or home occupations that exceed the thresholds identified in § 145-120.3.B. shall be considered Class 2 home occupations which may only be authorized by Site Plan Approval and a Conditional Use Permit in accordance with § 145-120.
2. Not more than one (1) home occupation, whether Class 1 or Class 2, may occur on a single residential lot and shall conform with § 145-120.3.B(1).
3. Class 1 home occupations shall not occupy more than five hundred (500) square feet of the total floor area or twenty-five percent (25%) of the total floor area of the dwelling on the premises, whichever shall be the more restrictive. This floor area requirement refers only to heated and habitable rooms within the dwelling unit. Class 2 home occupations shall not occupy more than 500 square feet or twenty-five percent (25%) of the total floor area of the dwelling and accessory structure used in the home occupation, whichever shall be more restrictive.
4. Except for articles produced on the premises and other articles customarily associated with the product made or the service provided on the premises, no stock in trade shall be displayed or sold on the premises nor shall any item be available for rental.
5. There shall be no parking, storage or standing of any commercial vehicles or construction equipment, except as otherwise permitted in residential districts, and no outdoor display of goods, outdoor storage of materials, or outdoor storage of equipment used in conjunction with a home occupation.
6.

Any new construction undertaken to accommodate the home occupation activity shall also be wholly consistent with the character of a residential premises.
7. The lot on which the home occupation is proposed shall meet the minimum lot area and setback requirements set forth in the Table of Bulk Requirements for the district, and the accessory building proposed to house the home occupation shall similarly meet all setback and related bulk requirements set forth in this Chapter.

8. The home occupation shall not generate any solid waste or sewage discharge, in volume or type, which is not normally associated with residential use in the neighborhood.
9. Only customary home appliances and light office equipment shall be used, and no offensive noise, vibration, glare, dust, odors, heat, fumes, smoke, or electrical interference shall be detectable to the normal senses off the lot. In the case of electrical interference, no equipment or process shall be used which creates visual or audible interference in any radio or television receivers off the premises.
10. Not more than one (1) person, outside the members of the household occupying the dwelling, shall be employed on the residential premises in the conduct of the home occupation. Off-street parking shall be provided for the additional employed person and shall conform to all applicable regulations of Articles VII and IX. Any use requiring, in accordance with the Table of General Use Requirements, more than three (3) off-street parking spaces shall be deemed a Class 2 home occupation under this Chapter.

13. Class 1 home occupations shall be compatible with the residential use of the property and the residential character of the neighborhood and shall not be classified as a Class 2 home occupation requiring a Conditional Use Permit provided that:
a. The volume of invitees or clients who visit the home occupation premises is less than six (6) per day, and
b. The volume of deliveries or truck traffic is less than an average of three (3) per day, and
c. The home occupation requires no more than two (2) parking spaces in addition to those required under § 145-70.

14. The following uses are specifically prohibited from consideration as permitted home occupations under this Chapter, because of parking requirements, deliveries and other issues of land use compatibility. Uses that have been identified with a “” and that do not exceed the thresholds provided herein, may be permitted as Class 2 home occupations, subject to the conditional use permit requirements of § 145-120.

145-120.4 Accessory Apartments
It is the specific purpose and intent to allow one accessory apartment within one-family residential structures or in an accessory structure such as a garage or other detached building on a lot containing a one-family residence in order to provide the opportunity and encouragement for the development of small, rental housing units designed, in particular, to meet the special housing needs of single persons and couples. It is the further purpose and intent of this provision to allow the more efficient use of the Village's existing housing stock, to provide economic support for existing resident families of limited income, and to preserve and protect property values. The following specific standards are set forth for such accessory uses:
A. The owner(s) of the one-family residence in which the accessory apartment is to be located shall occupy at least one (1) of such units on the premises. The owner shall have been a resident on the premises for at least twelve (12) consecutive months immediately preceding submission of the accessory apartment application. Should the owner have a place of residence other than the premises for a period of more than six (6) months, the conditional use permit shall become null and void, and the premises shall revert to its original permitted use which existed immediately prior to the issuance

Proof of existence shall be demonstrated by an issued Certificate of Occupancy or be proven by the applicant (using deeds, dated surveys showing the structure, insurance documents, tax records, dated permits or other such documents) to the satisfaction of the Code Enforcement Officer as having been built prior to the date when certificates of occupancy were issued for such structure. Adding an accessory apartment is considered a change in use to the property.
D. The maximum floor area for the accessory apartment whether in main dwelling or in an accessory structure shall be eight hundred (800) square feet and the minimum floor area of the accessory apartment shall be four hundred (400) square feet and as such shall not exceed the size of the primary residence. If the accessory apartment is proposed within the main dwelling, the primary residence shall not be reduced below one thousand (1000) square feet. These areas shall be exclusive of porches or basements. There shall be no more than one (1) bedroom per accessory apartment.
E. Off-street parking spaces shall be provided for each dwelling unit in accordance with § 145-70 of this Zoning Law but in no case shall the parking space be located in the front yard, in the driveway forward of the front building line of the dwelling unit or in the 1st layer as defined herein.

Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 185
M. The accessory apartment shall be located within the residential structure so that the floor level of the apartment shall not be more than four (4) feet below the average adjoining finished grade. No habitable space used for an accessory apartment shall be located in cellars, except that below-grade space is permitted as habitable space for an accessory apartment where in conformity with the following conditions:
1. The grade adjoining one exterior wall for the entire width of the habitable space is at or lower than the floor level of the habitable space.

145-120.5 Formula Businesses
A. Purpose. The Village of Warwick is unique not only because of its well preserved historic structures, but because of its small individualized shops and restaurants as well. Warwick’s historic downtown district is recognizable nationwide. It attracts thousands of visitors each year, a large part of whom come to enjoy and experience the unique character of the Village and its numerous quaint shops and restaurants. This unique character would be adversely affected by a proliferation of "formula businesses" which are required by contractual or other arrangements to be virtually identical to businesses in other communities as a result of standardized services, merchandise, decor, uniforms and the like. The development of such businesses, if unchecked and unregulated, would conflict with the distinct atmosphere and unique character for which Warwick’s historic district is recognized. Therefore, the Village Board finds that in order to preserve the character of the business district and other mixed use area, it is reasonable and necessary to monitor and regulate the establishment of formula businesses through issuance of conditional use permits, in accordance with Articles XI and XII of this Zoning Law.
1. In addition to the standards set forth in § 145-120, and in addition to any and all recommendations of the Architectural and Historic District Review Board (AHDRB), the Planning Board shall require that all of the following standards be met for formula businesses in the CB, GC and TND Districts:
a. Approval of the formula business establishment will not alter the identity of the Village business district or other similar mixed use district in a way that detracts from its uniqueness or contributes to a nationwide trend of standardized downtown offerings;
b. Approval of the formula business establishment will contribute to a diverse and appropriate blend of businesses in these areas;
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 186
c. Approval of the formula business establishment will complement those businesses already in the downtown business district and help promote and foster the local economic base as a whole;
d. The formula business establishment will be compatible with existing surrounding uses; has been designed and will be operated in a non-obtrusive manner to preserve the community's character and ambiance; and the proposed intensity of uses on the site is appropriate given the uses permitted on the site and on adjoining sites, including but not limited to the following:
(1) The size of any individual formula business shall not exceed two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet of gross floor area.
(2) The street frontage of any individual formula business shall not exceed sixty-five feet (65') in width.
(3) No drive through windows shall be permitted.
(4) The applicant shall submit a plan indicating the provision for rubbish removal, including the dumpster location with proper screening and buffering so that there will not be any substantial impacts to abutting properties.
(5) There shall not be a substantial impact to the public safety from increased traffic. At the discretion of the Planning Board, the applicant may be required to submit a traffic impact study during the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQR) review of the application.
(6) There shall not be any impacts to the roadway or abutting properties from the loading area.
(7) Advertising or anything displaying a corporate logo, is forbidden to be displayed in the windows.
(8) No signs which are internally illuminated shall be allowed in accordance with § 145-81.H. of the Zoning Law.
B. Consistency with Village Plan and Historic District. Approval of the formula business establishment shall be consistent with the policies and standards of the Village Comprehensive Plan and the Historic District requirements, if applicable, contained in § 145-24 of the Zoning Law.
145-121 Hotels And Motels
A. Hotel and motel units shall not contain kitchen facilities of any nature, shall not be used as apartments for non-transient tenant, shall not contain more than two (2) rooms and shall not be connected by interior doors in groups of more than two (2). There shall be no more than one (1) hotel or motel unit for each one thousand four hundred (1,400) square feet of site area exclusive of required setbacks.
B. Each hotel or motel room shall have an area of at least three hundred (300) square feet. Each hotel or motel unit shall have a bath facility with shower or bath, one (1) toilet
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 187
facility and sink. No motel or hotel building shall exceed a height of two (2) stories or thirty (30) feet, whichever is less.
C. The following accessory uses shall be permitted:
1. One (1) apartment with or without kitchen facilities for the use of the hotel or motel manager or caretaker and his family within the motel building.
2. One (1) coffee shop for hotels or motels with no more than one hundred (100) rooms is permitted. Such facilities shall be located within the hotel or motel building.

Signage shall be of a monument type integrated into a planter or landscaping and shall not exceed five feet in height from the ground. Provide a ten (10) foot wide landscaped area along all gasoline service station property lines, excluding the front lot line, property lines adjacent to existing commercial uses and access points. The landscaped area shall be densely planted with a mixture of shrubs, trees and a fence, not less than six (6) feet high, which will create an opaque screen. All landscaped areas along property lines which are crossed by access drives shall be planted with low shrubs not greater than three (3) feet high and trees with a branching habit which begins at least eight (8) feet above ground level.

145-129 Affordable Housing
A. Purpose. In order to provide a choice of housing opportunities for a variety of income groups within the Village of Warwick, in accordance with the purposes of this Article and the policies of the Village of Warwick Comprehensive Plan, the Planning Board shall deny any application for a conditional use permit for a subdivision, where affordable housing units are mandatory, if the applicant does not comply at a minimum with the following requirements for affordable housing units:
1. Five or more lots. Subdivisions of land into five (5) or more lots for single-family dwellings are required to include fifteen percent (15%) of the total number of dwelling units within the subdivision as affordable housing units. As an incentive, a density bonus of fifteen percent (15%) will be granted. For example, in a subdivision containing five (5) lots, one lot must contain an affordable housing unit (5 x .15 = .75 which is rounded up to produce one unit). In a subdivision containing ten (10) lots, two lots must contain an affordable housing unit (10 x .15 = 1.5 which is rounded up to produce two units). In the five (5) lot example, one bonus lot would be approved for a total of 6 lots, while in the ten (10) lot example, two bonus lots would be approved for a total of 12 lots. The Planning Board shall review the resources and public facilities available to the subdivision including transportation, water supply, waste disposal and fire protection, during the mandatory SEQR review, to ensure the additional density being proposed will not create significant environmentally damaging consequences.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 194
2. On-site units required. The requirement for affordable housing units shall be established by constructing new dwelling units or rehabilitating existing dwelling units on the site proposed for subdivision approval, subject to the conditional use permit.
3. Siting of affordable units. All affordable units constructed or rehabilitated under this Zoning Law shall be situated within the development so as not to be in less desirable locations than market-rate units in the development and shall, on average, be no less accessible to public amenities, such as open space, as the market-rate units.
4. Minimum design and construction standards for affordable units. Affordable housing units within market rate developments shall be integrated with the rest of the development and shall be compatible in both interior and exterior design, appearance, construction and quality of materials with other units.
5. Timing of construction or provision of affordable units or lots. Where feasible, affordable housing units shall be provided coincident to the development of market-rate units, but in no event shall the development of affordable units be delayed beyond the schedule noted below:
Market-Rate Unit % Affordable Housing Unit % Up to 30% None required 30% plus 1 unit 10% Up to 50% 30% Up to 75% 50% 75% plus 1 unit 70% Up to 90% 100% Fractions of units shall not be counted.
6. Local Preference. First preference for affordable housing units shall be given to existing residents of the Village of Warwick, second preference to residents of the Town of Warwick, third preference to other towns but who work as municipal or school district employees in Warwick, fourth preference to other residents of Orange County, and fifth preference to all others as permitted by law. Proof of residency, such as a driver's license or voter registration card, will be accepted to determine residency.
7. Marketing Plan for Affordable Units. Applicants under this Zoning Law shall submit a marketing plan or other method approved by the Village, to the
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 195
Planning Board for its approval, which describes how the affordable units will be marketed to potential homebuyers or tenants. This plan shall include a description of the lottery or other process to be used for selecting buyers or tenants.
8. Maximum Incomes and Selling Prices: Initial Sale. To ensure that only eligible households purchase affordable housing units, the purchaser of an affordable unit shall be required to submit copies of the last three years' federal and state income tax returns and certify, in writing and prior to transfer of title, to the developer of the housing units or his/her agent, and within thirty (30) days following transfer of title, to the local housing trust, community development corporation, housing authority or other agency as established by the Village, that his/her or their family's annual income level does not exceed the maximum level for affordable housing as established by the Village of Warwick, and as may be revised from time to time.
9. Preservation of Affordability; Restrictions on Resale. Each affordable unit created in accordance with this Zoning Law shall have limitations governing its resale. The purpose of these limitations is to preserve the long-term affordability of the unit and to ensure its continued availability for affordable income households. The resale controls shall be established through a deed restriction on the property and shall be in force for a period of forty (40) years. All deeds of affordable housing units shall contain references to the restrictions on resale, enumerated herein, and such restrictions shall be placed on the subdivision plat as a condition of approval.
a. Resale price. Sales beyond the initial sale to a qualified affordable income purchaser shall include the initial discount rate between the sale price and the unit's appraised value at the time of resale. This percentage shall be recorded as part of the restriction on the property noted above. For example, if a unit appraised for $100,000 is sold for $75,000 as a result of this Zoning Law, it has sold for seventy-five percent (75%) of its appraised value. If, several years later, the appraised value of the unit at the time of proposed resale is $150,000, the unit may be sold for no more than $112,500, seventy-five percent (75%) of the appraised value of $150,000.
b. The Planning Board shall require, as a condition for a conditional use permit under this Zoning Law, that the applicant comply with the mandatory set-asides and accompanying restrictions on affordability, including the execution of the deed rider noted above. The Code Enforcement Officer shall not issue a Certificate of Occupancy for any affordable unit until the deed restriction is recorded.

ARTICLE XIII Nonconforming Uses, Buildings or Lots
145-130 Applicability Of Article
This Article applies to lots, buildings, structures and non-building uses in existence on the effective date of this law. The lawful use of any such premises or uses existing on the effective date of this chapter may be continued although neither such use conforms nor the bulk complies with the requirements, except as hereinafter follows:
145-131 Nonconforming Buildings, Structures or Lots
A. Any nonconforming use may be continued indefinitely, but:
1. Alterations: shall not be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, restored or placed on a different portion of the lot or parcel of land occupied by such uses on the effective date of this chapter, nor shall any external evidence of such use be increased by any means whatsoever, except that the Planning Board may permit an expansion not to exceed 15% of the existing ground area of said nonconforming use, provided that the most restrictive bulk requirements specified in the district in which said nonconforming use is located, shall apply to any such extension.
2. Displacement: no nonconforming use shall be extended to displace a conforming use.
3. Discontinuance: shall not be re-established if such use has been discontinued for any reason for a period of one year or more or has been changed to or replaced by a conforming use. Intent to resume a nonconforming use shall not confer the right to do so.
B. District changing. Whenever the boundaries of the district shall be changed so as to transfer an area from one district to another district of a different classification, the foregoing provisions shall also apply to any nonconforming uses existing therein.
C. Nonconformity in areas other than structure or use. Normal maintenance and repair, structural alteration in and moving, reconstruction or enlargement of a building which does not house a nonconforming use, but is nonconforming as to the district regulations for lot area, lot width, lot depth, front yard, side yard, rear yard, minimum height, maximum lot coverage or minimum livable floor area per dwelling is permitted if the same does not increase the degree of or create any new nonconformity.
D. Normal maintenance. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent normal maintenance and repair of any building or the carrying out upon the issuance of a building permit of major structural alteration or demolitions necessary in the interest of public safety. In granting such a permit, the Code Enforcement Officer shall state the precise reason why such alterations were deemed necessary.
E. Nonconforming Lots.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 197
1. All applications submitted to the Code Enforcement Officer involving nonconforming lots shall require a variance from the Zoning Board of Appeals.
2. A residential lot, separated from any other land in the same ownership and nonconforming as to bulk and not located in and part of a subdivision plat approved by the Planning Board and filed in the Office of the County Clerk, and which has a minimum lot width of one hundred (100) feet, may be used for a one-family detached residence, provided that such use shall comply with the bulk requirements as specified in the Table of Bulk Requirements for Use Group "f".
3. For all residential lots having less than one hundred (100) feet of lot width, the following minimum requirements shall apply:
a. The minimum width of one (1) required side setback shall be twenty (20) feet.

c. The minimum front and rear setbacks shall be thirty (30) feet for lots in the LO, GC and CB districts and fifty (50) feet for lots in the LI Districts.
d. The minimum lot width and lot frontage shall be seventy five (75) feet.

A lot shall not be considered nonconforming with respect to the front setback or front yard requirements of this chapter if said condition is the result of a street right-of-way widening reservation or dedication, whether in fee or easement, required by the Planning Board at the time of subdivision or Site Plan approval.
145-132 Additional Considerations
A. Repair and Alteration. Normal maintenance and repair of a building or structure is permitted if it does not extend the non-conforming use. No extension, alteration or
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 198
enlargement shall be made in a building or structure occupied by a non-conforming use, nor in a non-conforming non-building use except:
1. When required pursuant to an order of a Court of Competent Jurisdiction.
2. To adapt the building or structure to a conforming use.
3. In a building or structure occupied by a non-conforming use or in a non-conforming non-building use permitted to extend under § 145-132D.
B. Change of Use. Any non-conforming use shall not be changed to another non-conforming use without prior approval by the Board of Appeals and then only to a use which as determined by the Board of Appeals is of the same or a more restricted nature. If the Board of Appeals approves such changes, they shall conform, to the extent practical to current design standards and are also subject to Site Plan approval by the Planning Board.
C. Cessation of Use. If active continuous operations are not carried on in a non-conforming use during a continuous period of one (1) year, the building or land where such previously existed shall thereafter be occupied and used only for a conforming use. Intent to resume active operations shall not affect the foregoing. The time period set forth herein shall be tolled for any cessation of use pursuant to a court order.
D. Permitted Extension or Enlargement shall mean:
1. In the case of a non-conforming use in a building the enlargement or extension of such use so as to create additional floor area within any existing building to any portion of the floor area therein not formerly used for such non-conforming use, except where such additional floor area was manifestly designed for such use at the time such use became non-conforming.
2. In the case of a non-conforming non-building use of any additional land on which no substantial operations were previously conducted, provided that any such extension or enlargement is on the same lot occupied by the non-conforming use on the effective date of this chapter and subject to Site Plan approval.
E. Damage and Destruction
1. In the event of damage and destruction by fire or other casualty of any structure existing on the effective date of this Zoning Law the owner shall have one (1) year to apply for a building permit and six (6) months to initiate construction and earnestly pursue completion thereafter to rebuild the same size structure, regardless if the structure is conforming.
2. In the event that the living quarters of a residential structure are damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty, the owner of the property may apply to the Code Enforcement Officer for temporary residential use of a trailer during the reconstruction process, provided that reconstruction is earnestly pursued and the trailer is removed upon issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy or one (1) year from issuance of a building permit, whichever comes first.
F. Non-conforming Open Storage Yards or Outdoor Display. Any non-conforming open storage yard or any outdoor display or storage of merchandise which is non-conforming, may continue for one (1) year after the effective date of this law.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 199
G. Non-conforming Industrial Uses. In any Residential District, any non-conforming Industrial use which is permitted in the LI District may be continued for five (5) years after the effective date of this law, or an addition thereto that adds fifty percent (50%) or more to the real value of such use, whichever is the longer period, provided that, after the expiration of that period, such non-conforming use shall then be terminated.
H. Modification by Zoning Board of Appeals. If an application is made at least six (6) months before the expiration of the period prescribed for termination of a non-conforming use or non-complying bulk, and the Zoning Board of Appeals shall find that the period prescribed is unreasonable or inadequate for the amortization of the special value of the property resulting from such non-conforming use or non-complying bulk, then the Zoning Board of Appeals may grant such an extension of the period prescribed as it shall deem to be reasonable and adequate for such amortization, provided that no such period of extension shall exceed one-hundred percent (100%) of the period prescribed and that such extension may be granted only once for any use.
I. Continued Use After Termination Date is a Violation. The continuation of a non-conforming use or non-complying bulk after the termination date fixed for the same shall constitute a violation of this law.
J. Appeal of Decision. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Planning Board hereunder may, within thirty (30) days of the filing of the decision with the office of the Planning Board Secretary, appeal pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Laws and Rules.

Village of Warwick Zoning Law

B. Interpretation - On an appeal from any order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official or by the Code Enforcement Officer to decide any of the following questions:
1. Determination of the meaning of any portion of the text of this chapter or of any condition or requirement specified or made under the provisions of this chapter.
2. Determination of the exact location of any District Boundary shown on the Zoning Districts Map.
C. Variances - Appeal from an order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Code Enforcement Officer or on referral of an applicant to the Board by an approving agency acting pursuant to this chapter, the Zoning Board of Appeals is authorized to vary or modify the strict letter of this chapter where its literal interpretation would cause practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, as defined in this section, in such manner as to observe the spirit of this chapter, the Village Comprehensive Plan, secure public safety and welfare and do substantial justice. In granting variances, the Board is authorized to impose such reasonable conditions and restrictions as are directly related to and incidental to the proposed use of the property.
1. Area Variances. Where, because of practical difficulty, an applicant requests a variance of the bulk requirements of this chapter, the Board may grant a variance in the application of the provision of this chapter in the specific case, provided that, as a condition to the grant of any such variance, the Board shall make a specific finding that the application of the requirements of this chapter to the land in question creates such practical difficulty. In making this determination, the Board shall make each and every one (1) of the following findings:
a. The variation is not substantial in relation to the requirement.
b. The effect of any increased population density which may thus be produced upon available services and facilities is not significant.
c. A substantial change in the character of the neighborhood or a substantial detriment to adjoining properties will not be created.
d. The difficulty cannot be alleviated by some method feasible for the applicant to pursue other than a variance.
e. In view of the manner in which the difficulty arose and considering all of the above factors, the interests of justice will be serviced by allowing the variance.
f. The variation would not cause adverse aesthetic, environmental or ecological impacts on the property or on surrounding areas.
g. The alleged difficulty was not self-created, which consideration shall be relevant to the decision of the Board but does necessarily preclude the granting of the area variance.
Village of Warwick Zoning Law
February 17, 2009 208
2. Use Variances. Where, because of unnecessary hardship relating to the land for use not allowed in the district in which the land is located, the Board may grant a variance in the application of the provisions of this chapter in the specific case, provided that as a condition to the grant of any such variance, the Board shall make each and every one (1) of the following findings:
a. After considering each and every permitted use for the Zoning District in question, the applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided that lack of return is substantial as demonstrated by competent financial evidence.
b. The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances affecting the property which is the subject of the application and not to general conditions in the neighborhood.
c. The use to be authorized by the variance is in reasonable harmony with the intent of this chapter and will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood.
d. The unnecessary hardship claimed as a ground for the variance has not been created by the owner of by predecessor in title; mere purchase of the land subject to the restrictions sought to be varied shall not itself constitute a self-created hardship.
