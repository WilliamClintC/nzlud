§ 4-1. Purpose.
The Lawrence Village Board of Trustees hereby enacts this article to provide a process
for appointing alternate members of the Planning Board and Zoning Board of Appeals.
These individuals would serve when members are absent or unable to participate on an
application or matter before the respective Board.
§ 4-2. Appointment; term. [Amended 9-2-2010 by L.L. No. 7-2010]

member eligibility, vacancy in office, removal, compatibility of office and service on
other boards, as well as any provision of a local ordinance, shall also apply to alternate
A. The Chairperson of the Planning Board and Zoning Board of Appeals may
designate an alternate to substitute for a member when such member is unable to
participate on an application or matter before the Board. Such designations shall be
made in rotation as nearly as feasible, so that each alternate has an equivalent
opportunity to serve. When so designated, the alternate member shall possess all
the powers and responsibilities of such member of the Board. Such designation
shall be entered into the minutes of the initial Planning Board and Zoning Board of
Appeals meeting at which the substitution is made.
B. Alternates shall have the right to attend all portions of meetings of the Board,
including executive sessions, if any, whether or not designated to participate in
place of a regular member. An alternate who so attends a meeting of the Board
without being so designated to substitute at that meeting may, at the discretion of
the Chairperson, sit with the regular Board members and participate in any
questions or discussions in the same manner as regular members, but without the
right to vote. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the rights of any
such alternate member to participate in the same manner as permitted for members
of the public.

construction of any street within the Village.
K. To exercise the powers conferred upon it, directly or by implication, by this chapter
or any other chapter or local law.
A. Where a lot is situated partly within the Village and partly outside the Village, the
Board of Appeals may permit the regulations of Chapter 12, Building Design,
Board of, and Chapter 212, Zoning, to be applied to the entire lot, or such portion
of it as the Board may determine, in the same manner and to the same extent as if
such lot, or portion thereof, had been situated entirely within the Village and within
the same zoning district established by Chapter 212, Zoning. For such purpose, the

Board Established
[Adopted 1-14-1998 by L.L. No. 1-19983
§ 12-1. Policy.
§ 12-2. Continuation; membership; residency of members.
The Board of Building Design heretofore established is hereby continued.
A. The Board of Trustees finds that excessive similarity or general inappropriateness
of design in the exterior appearance of residential and/or commercial buildings
erected in a respective district adversely affects the desirability of the immediate
area and neighboring areas for residential and/or commercial purposes and by so
doing impairs the benefits for residential and/or commercial purposes and by so
doing impairs the benefits of occupancy of existing residential and/or commercial
property in such areas, impairs the stability and value of both improved and
unimproved real property in such areas, prevents the most appropriate development
of such areas, produces degeneration of residential and/or commercial property in
such areas with attendant deterioration of conditions affecting the health, safety and
welfare of the inhabitants thereof and destroys a proper relationship between the
table value of real property in such areas and the cost of municipal services
provided therefor.
B. It is the purpose of Chapter 6, Appeals, Board of, this article and Chapter 212,
Zoning, to prevent these and other harmful effects of such exterior appearances of
buildings erected in residential and/or commercial neighborhoods and thus to
promote and protect the health, safety and general welfare of the community.
C. It is the further purpose of this article to preserve and promote the character and
appearances and conserve the property values of the Village, the attractiveness of
whose residential and business areas is the economic mainstay of the community,
by providing procedures for a review of structures henceforth erected, reconstructed
or altered in the Village and thereby:
(1) To encourage good quality of exterior building design and appearances and to
relate such design and appearances to the sites and surroundings of the
structure.
(2) To permit originality and resourcefulness in building design and appearance
which are appropriate to the sites and surroundings.
(3) To prevent such designs and appearances as are unnecessarily offensive to
visual sensibilities.
A. It shall consist of five members who will serve without compensation.

structures and the character of the Village and its peculiar suitability for particular
purposes, with a view to conserving the values of property and encouraging the
most appropriate use of land.
D. The Board may approve any application referred to it upon finding that the building
or structure for which the permit was requested, if erected or altered in accordance
with the submitted plan, would be in harmony with the purpose of this article,
would not be visually offensive or inappropriate by reason of poor quality of
exterior design, excessive similarity or striking visual discord in relation to the sites
or surroundings, would not mar the appearance of the area, would not impair the
use, enjoyment and desirability or reduce the values of properties in the area, would
not be detrimental to the character of the neighborhood, would not prevent the most
appropriate development and utilization of the site or of adjacent lands and would
not adversely affect the functioning, economic stability, prosperity, health, safety
and general welfare of the entire community.
E. In approving any application, the Board may impose appropriate conditions and
safeguards designed to prevent the harmful effects set forth in § 12-1.
F. The Board may disapprove any application for a permit, provided that the Board
has afforded the applicant an opportunity to confer upon suggestions for change of

the plan, and provided that the Board finds and states that the structure for which
the permit was requested would, if erected as indicated, provoke one or more of the
harmful effects set forth in § 12-1 and thus be detrimental to the character, property
values or development of the surrounding property or of the Village as a whole by
reason of:
(1) Excessive similarity to any other structure or structures located or proposed to
be located on the same street or corner thereof and within 500 feet of the site
of the structure for which a building permit is requested, in respect to one or
more of the following features of exterior design and appearance:
(a) Substantially identical facade.
(b) Substantially identical size and arrangement of either doors, windows,
porticoes, porches or garages or other openings or breaks or extensions in
the facade, including reverse arrangements.
(c) Other substantially identical features, such as but not limited to setbacks
from street lines, heights, widths and lengths of elements of the building
design and exterior materials and treatments.
(2) Striking dissimilarity, visual discord or inappropriateness with respect to other
structures located or proposed to be located on the same street or a corner
thereof and within 150 feet of the site of the structures for which a building
permit is requested, in respect to one or more of the following features of
exterior design and appearance:
(a) Facade.
(b) Size and arrangement of doors, windows, porticoes, porches or garages
or other openings, breaks or extensions in the facade.
(c) Other significant design features, such as but not limited to heights,
widths and lengths of elements of design, exterior materials and
treatments, roof structures, exposed mechanical equipment, service and
storage areas, retaining walls, landscaping, signs, light posts, parking
areas and fences and service and loading areas.
(3) Visual offensiveness or other poor qualities of exterior design, including, with
respect to signs and awnings, considerations of the harmony or discord of
colors, or incompatibility of the proposed structure with the terrain on which it
is to be located, including but not limited to excessive divergences of the
height or levels of any part of the structure from the grade of the terrain.
(4) There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the following matters would
produce one or more of the harmful effects set forth in § 12-1 and thus be
detrimental to the character, property values or development of the
surrounding property or of the Village as a whole: [Added 12-21-2017 by

Code of Ethics  See Ch. 23. Notification of defects  See Ch. 130.
§ 18-1. Intent and findings.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide legal and financial protection for those
individuals serving the Village of Lawrence from losses which may be brought against
them in their individual capacities for actions taken while in the performance of their
official duties and responsibilities. In enacting this chapter, the Village of Lawrence
Board of Trustees finds that the State of New York has enacted similar provisions for
the legal and financial security of its officers and employees and further finds that such
security is also required for local personnel. By enactment of this chapter, the Village of
Lawrence Board of Trustees does not intend to limit or otherwise abrogate any existing
right or responsibility of the Village or its employees with regard to indemnification
or legal defense. It is solely the intent of this chapter to provide similar coverage for
local employees as is presently provided for state employees, so as to continue to attract
qualified individuals to local government service.
§ 18-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires, the following terms shall
have the meanings indicated:
EMPLOYEEAny person holding a position by election, appointment or employment
in the service of the Village of Lawrence, whether or not compensated, or a volunteer
expressly authorized to participate in a municipally sponsored volunteer program, but
shall not include an independent contractor. The term "employee" shall include a former
employee, his estate or judicially appointed personal representative.
§ 18-3. Defense to be provided; conditions to provide defense.
A. Upon compliance by the employee with the provisions of § 18-5 of this chapter, the
Village shall provide for the defense of the employee in any civil action or
proceeding in any state or federal court arising out of any alleged act or omission
which occurred, or is alleged in the complaint to have occurred, while the employee
was acting within the scope of his public employment or duties or which is brought
to enforce a provision of § 1981 or 1983 of Title 42 of the United States Code. This
duty to provide for a defense shall not arise where such civil action or proceeding
is brought by or on behalf of the Village of Lawrence.
B. Subject to the conditions set forth in Subsection A of this section, the employee
shall be entitled to be represented by the Village Attorney; provided, however, that
the employee shall be entitled to representation by private counsel of his choice in
§ 12-13 DEFENSE AND INDEMNIFICATION § 18-3
18:1
§ 18-4. Indemnification of employees.
any civil judicial proceeding whenever the Village Attorney determines, based
upon his investigation and review of the facts and circumstances of the case, that
representation by the Village Attorney would be inappropriate or whenever a court
of competent jurisdiction, upon appropriate motion or by a special proceeding,
determines that a conflict of interest exists and that the employee is entitled to be
represented by private counsel of his choice. The Village Attorney may require, as
a condition to payment of fees and expenses of such representation, that appropriate
groups of such employees be represented by the same counsel. If the employee
or group of employees is entitled to be represented by private counsel under the
provisions of this section, the Village Attorney shall so certify to the Village Board.
Reasonable attorney's fees and litigation expenses shall be paid by the Village to
such private counsel from time to time during the pendency of the civil action or
proceeding, subject to certification that the employee is entitled to representation
under the terms and conditions of this section by the head of the department,
commission, division, office or agency in which such employee is employed and
upon the audit of the Board of Trustees and warrant of the Village Treasurer. Any
dispute with respect to representation of multiple employees by a single counsel or
the amount of litigation expenses or the reasonableness of attorneys' fees shall be
resolved by the court upon motion or by way of special proceeding.
C. Where the employee delivers process and a request for a defense to the Village
Attorney as required by § 18-5 of this chapter, the Attorney shall take the necessary
steps, including the retention of private counsel under the terms and conditions
provided in Subsection B of this section, on behalf of the employee to avoid entry
of a default judgment pending resolution of any question pertaining to the
obligation to provide for a defense.
A. The Village shall indemnify and save harmless its employees in the amount of any
judgment obtained against such employees in any state or federal court or in the
amount of any settlement of a claim, provided that the act or omission from which
such judgment or settlement arose occurred while the employee was acting within
the scope of his public employment or duties.
B. An employee represented by private counsel shall cause to be submitted to the
Village of Lawrence Board of Trustees any proposed settlement which may be
subject to indemnification by the Village, and, if not inconsistent with the
provisions of this section, the Mayor shall certify, after approval of such settlement
by the Board of Trustees, and submit such settlement and certification to the Village
Attorney. The Attorney shall review such proposed settlement as to form and
amount and shall give his approval if, in his judgment, the settlement is in the best
interest of the Village. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the
Village to indemnify or save harmless an employee with respect to a settlement not
so reviewed and approved by the Village Attorney and Board of Trustees.
C. Upon entry of a final judgment against the employee or upon the settlement of the
claim, the employee shall cause to be served a copy of such judgment or settlement,
personally or by certified or registered mail, within 30 days of the date of entry or
settlement, upon the Mayor; and, if not inconsistent with the provisions of this
section, such judgment or settlement shall be certified for payment by such Mayor.

§ 18-5. Conditions on duty to defend or indemnify.5
The duty to defend or indemnify and save harmless provided by this chapter shall be
conditioned upon the delivery to the Village Administrator or his assistant, at his office,
by the employee, of the original or a copy of any summons, complaint, process, notice,
demand or pleading within 10 days after he is served with such document and upon
the full cooperation of the employee in the defense of such action or proceeding and
in defense of any action or proceeding against the Village based upon the same act or
omission and in the prosecution of any appeal. Such delivery shall be deemed a request
by the employee that the Village provide for his defense pursuant to this chapter.
§ 18-6. Applicability to employees.
The benefits of this chapter shall inure only to employees as defined herein and shall not
enlarge or diminish the rights of any other party, nor shall any provision of this chapter
be construed to affect, alter or repeal any provision of the Worker's Compensation Law.
§ 18-7. Effect upon insurance.
The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to impair, alter, limit or modify the
rights and obligations of any insurer under any policy of insurance.
§ 18-8. Applicability to pending actions.
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all actions and proceedings pending upon
the effective date thereof or thereafter instituted.
§ 18-9. Effect on other law.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, the provisions of this chapter
shall not be construed in any way to impair, alter, limit, modify, abrogate or restrict
any immunity available to or conferred upon any unit, entity, officer or employee of the
Village or any right to defense and/or indemnification provided for any governmental
officer or employee by, in accordance with or by reason of any other provision of state
or federal statutory or common law.
If the Attorney concurs in such certification, the judgment or settlement shall be
paid upon the audit of the Board of Trustees and warrant of the Village Treasurer.

Chapter 23
ETHICS, CODE OF
GENERAL REFERENCES
Defense and indemnification of employees  See Ch. 18. Public access to records  See Ch. 149.
§ 23-1. Purpose.
Pursuant to the provisions of § 806 of the General Municipal Law, the Board of Trustees
of the Village of Lawrence recognizes that there are rules of ethical conduct for public
officers and employees which must be observed if a high degree of moral conduct is to
be obtained and if public confidence is to be maintained in our unit of local government.
It is the purpose of this Code of Ethics to promulgate these rules of ethical conduct
for the officers and employees of said Village. These rules shall serve as a guide for
the official conduct of the officers and employees of said Village. The rules of the
ethical conduct of this code, as adopted, shall not conflict with but shall be in addition
to any prohibition of Article 18 of the General Municipal Law or any other general or
special law relating to ethical conduct and interest in contracts of municipal officers and
employees.
§ 23-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
INTEREST  A pecuniary or material benefit accruing to a municipal officer or
employee, unless the context otherwise requires.
MUNICIPAL OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE  An officer or employee of the Village
of Lawrence, whether paid or unpaid, including members of any administrative board,
commission or other agency thereof. No person shall be deemed to be a municipal officer
or employee solely by reason of being a volunteer fireman or civil defense volunteer,
except a Chief Engineer or Assistant Chief Engineer.
§ 23-3. Standards of conduct.
Every officer or employee of the Village of Lawrence shall be subject to and abide by
the following standards of conduct:
A. General.
(1) A person who accepts a public office or public employment subjects himself
to legal and ethical standards of conduct that are broader and more exacting
than those applicable in private office or private employment. He does not act
for a private individual or corporation or to enable a private individual or
corporation to make a profit. He acts for and in behalf of the public. In his
dealings with others, he represents the public. He, too, is a member of the
public. Just as he would wish public officers and employees to deal with him
§ 18-9 ETHICS, CODE OF § 23-3
23:1
as a member of the public, so he, as a public official or member of the
public, should deal with others. Just as he would demand that the officers and
employees of his municipality maintain the highest standards of honesty and
integrity and subordinate their own personal interests to the interests of the
municipality that they represent, so must he maintain the highest standards of
honesty and integrity and subordinate his own personal interest to the interests
of the municipality that he represents. Just as he would condemn the officers
and employees of his municipality if they used their offices or employment for
personal gain and advantage, so he must avoid the same acts and conduct that
he would condemn in others.
(2) Honesty and integrity cannot be legislated. It cannot be defined by statute,
ordinance, code, rule or regulation. The specific standards enumerated in this
code must be observed, the specific disclosures set forth in the statute must be
made. But it does not follow that acts not expressly prohibited are permitted or
sanctioned or that conflicts of interest that are not specifically directed to be
disclosed may be concealed. There are ethical and moral standards of
conscience and common decency as well. These may be even more vital and
compelling than the standards that have been specifically set forth in statute or
code. They, too, must be scrupulously observed.
B. Gifts. He shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit any gift or accept or receive any
gift, regardless of its value, whether in the form of money, services, loan, travel,
entertainment, hospitality, thing or promise, or any other form, under circumstances
in which it could reasonably be inferred that the gift was intended to influence him,
or could reasonably be expected to influence him, in the performance of his official
duties or was intended as a reward for any official action on his part.
C. Confidential information. He shall not disclose confidential information acquired
by him in the course of his official duties or use such information to further his
personal interest.
D. Representation before one's own agency. He shall not receive or enter into any
agreement, express or implied, for compensation for services to be rendered in
relation to any matter before any municipal agency of which he is an officer,
member or employee or of any municipal agency over which he has jurisdiction or
to which he has the power to appoint any member, officer or employee.
E. Representation before any agency for a contingent fee. He shall not receive or enter
into any agreement, express or implied, for compensation for services to be
rendered in relation to any manner before any agency of his municipality, whereby
his compensation is to be dependent or contingent upon any action by such agency
with respect to such matter, provided that this subsection shall not prohibit the
fixing at any time of fees based upon the reasonable value of the services rendered.
F. Disclosure of interest in legislation. To the extent that he knows thereof, a member
of the Board of Trustees and any officer or employee of the Village of Lawrence,
whether paid or unpaid, who participates in the discussion or gives official opinion
to the Board of Trustees on any legislation before the Board of Trustees shall
publicly disclose on the official record the nature and extent of any direct or indirect
financial or other private interest he has in such legislation.
§ 23-3 LAWRENCE CODE § 23-3
23:2
§ 23-4. Effect upon employees' filing suit.
Nothing herein shall be deemed to bar or prevent the timely filing by a present or former
municipal officer or employee of any claim, account, demand or suit against the Village,
or any agency thereof, on behalf of himself or any member of his family, arising out of
any personal injury or property damage or for any lawful benefit authorized or permitted
by law.
§ 23-5. Distribution.
The Mayor shall cause a copy of this Code of Ethics to be distributed to every officer and
employee of the Village within 10 days after the effective date of this code. Each officer
and employee elected or appointed thereafter shall be furnished a copy before entering
upon the duties of his office or employment.
§ 23-6. Penalties for offenses.
In addition to any penalty contained in any other provision of law, any person who shall
knowingly and intentionally violate any of the provisions of this code may be fined,
suspended or removed from office or employment, as the case may be, in the manner
provided by law.
G. Investments in conflict with official duties. He shall not invest or hold any
investment, directly or indirectly, in any financial or business transaction which
creates a conflict with his official duties.
H. Private employment. He shall not engage in, solicit, negotiate for or promise to
accept private employment or render services for private interests when such
employment or services create a conflict with or impair the proper discharge of his
official duties.
I. Future employment. He shall not, after the termination of service or employment
with such municipality, appear before any board or agency of the Village in relation
to any case, proceeding or application in which he personally participated during
the period of his service or employment or which was under his active
consideration.

proposed work will be in compliance with the laws, ordinances and regulations
applicable thereto and the proposed construction or work will be safe, he shall
approve such application and issue a permit for the proposed work as soon as
practicable. If his examination reveals otherwise, he will reject such application,
noting his findings in a report to be attached to the application and sending a copy

made substantial progress on the construction of the foundation and
framing for the project; or

B. Building permits for minor construction projects shall expire six months after their
date of issuance unless the Superintendent of Buildings, or the Superintendent's
designee, determines that the permit holder has made substantial progress toward
completion of the work. If the Superintendent finds there has been substantial
progress in the work, the building permit shall continue to be valid for one year
from the date of issuance. For purposes of this subsection, "minor construction"
shall mean the alteration of an existing building or structure that does not change

project qualifies as a minor construction project shall be resolved by the
Superintendent of Buildings.
C. A permit issued for plumbing, drainage, air-conditioning, ventilation, refrigeration
or electrical work shall expire six months from the date of issuance unless issued in
conjunction with a building permit for major construction or minor construction, in
which case the permit shall be subject to the same expiration date(s) as the major or
minor construction permit.
D. Notwithstanding the above, a permit issued pursuant to this chapter may be
additionally extended for up to six months at a time upon written application to the
Building Department made within 30 days before the then-current permit expiration
date. It shall be the obligation of the permit holder alone to monitor the expiration
date of their permit and to contact the Building Department in advance of that date
to apply for an extension.
(1) The Superintendent of Buildings shall review each application for extension
and shall grant same if the Superintendent finds that:
(a) The request for extension was timely made;
(b) The permit holder has demonstrated good cause for the need for the
extension; and
(c) The permitted work has been substantially completed.

work. A permit holder's failure to properly close out or extend a permit prior to its
expiration shall result in forfeiture of the permit deposit and shall constitute a
violation of this chapter which, upon conviction, shall be punishable by a fine of
$1,500 for a first offense, $3,000 for a second offense occurring within 18 months
of a first offense, and $5,000 for a third or subsequent offense occurring within 18
months of a first offense.
F. Continuation of work after a permit has expired shall constitute a violation of this
chapter for performance of work without a permit.
A. The Building Inspector may suspend a permit or approval issued under the
provisions of this chapter in case he shall be satisfied that there has been any false
statement or misrepresentation as to a material fact in the application or plans on
which the permit or approval was based or that any of the work has been or is about
to be performed or materials furnished which do not comply with this chapter or
with the terms of the permit or that, in any respect, the provisions of this chapter or
of Chapter 212, Zoning, have been violated or have not been complied with.
B. The Building Inspector shall report the matter to the Board of Trustees at its next
regular meeting, and the holder of the permit so suspended shall have the
opportunity to appear before the Board of Trustees at said meeting or at some other
time fixed by the Board. The Board of Trustees may thereupon continue the
suspension of such permit or approval until the holder has complied with all matters
giving rise to such suspension, or, in its discretion, the Board of Trustees may

Inspector, certifying that the work for which the permit was issued has been completed
in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, provided that, if the occupancy or use
of such building was not discontinued during the work of alteration, the occupancy or
use of the building shall not continue for more than 30 days after completion of the
alterations unless such certificate shall have been issued.

§ 86-1. Applicability.
The area to which this chapter applies includes the marsh and meadowland, part of which
has been or may be filled in, in the Bannister Creek Basin, the Woodmere Channel Basin
and the land adjacent to Reynolds Channel, Crooked Creek and Broswere Bay, and the
creeks and streams tributary thereto, and is generally described as follows:
§ 86-2. Findings.
The areas to which this chapter applies consist principally of marsh and meadowland,
immediately adjacent to and crossed by tidal creeks and streams, the greater part of
which marsh and meadowland is covered with water during spring tides and during
storms. The development of this region involves many problems which do not exist
elsewhere in the Village and which directly affect the safety and health of persons who
may live, work or be present there, the protection of their property and the protection of
A. Bannister Creek Basin: bounded on the west by Doughty Boulevard; on the north
by Rock Hall Road; on the east by Causeway; and on the south by Barrett Road and
a line, part of which is marked by a road or former road, located where the
meadowland and the upland adjoin. It also includes the island, sometimes known as
"Williams Island," which lies between Reynolds Channel and a portion of Bannister
Creek.
B. Woodmere Channel Basin: bounded on the east by the Village line; on the north by
a line, part of which is marked by a road or former road designed as Cedarhurst
Avenue, and located where the meadowland and the upland adjoin; on the west by
the upland of the former Albro Farm; and on the south by Broswere Bay. It is
contiguous with Reynolds Channel, Crooked Creek and Broswere Bay Basin and
includes an area where the meadowland has heretofore been filled in.
C. Reynolds Channel, Crooked Creek and Broswere Bay Basin: bounded on the south
by Reynolds Channel; on the west by the upland at the Isle of Wight; on the north
by Mallow Way and a line, a portion of which is marked by a road or former road
designated variously as "Cedarhurst Avenue" or "Meadow Road," located where
the meadowland and the upland adjoin; and on the east by the Village line.

public improvements which may be located therein. Among such problems are:
§ 86-3. Plan to be approved before commencing work.
No work shall be performed or commenced, including filling, dredging, bulkheading,
clearing, grading, excavating, building, construction (temporary or permanent), road
construction, installation of sewers, drains, gas, water, electricity and other utilities or
work of any character whatsoever, except preliminary surveying and engineering, unless
and until a plan of development therefor shall have been filed with and approved by the
Board of Trustees of the Village of Lawrence.
§ 86-4. Development plan.
Such development plan shall be comprehensive and shall show all of the property
owned or controlled by the applicant and adjacent property and shall show all creeks,
streams, channels and waterways and all topographical features. So far as practicable,
it shall contain all of the information and details required by Chapter 182, Subdivision
of Land, of the Code of the Village of Lawrence. It shall show all proposed streets,
stormwater drains, sanitary sewers, pumping stations and disposal plants and shall show
the methods by which the various streets, drains, sewers and other facilities and utilities
are to be connected with the nearest existing facilities. It shall also contain construction
A. The flooding of these areas to a considerable depth of water, such as occurred
during the hurricanes of 1938 and 1944, which, in case of recurrence, might result
in a heavy loss of life and great destruction of property.
B. The unstable nature of the surface or of subsurface soil of the marsh and
meadowland, which, among other things, tends to:
(1) Result in uneven subsidence of the fill which may be placed thereon.
(2) Result in changes in grade and consequent fractures and disalignment of
sewers. drains, curbs and pavements.
(3) Make difficult the permanent retention of the fill in place.
(4) Endanger the stability of foundations of dwellings and other structures.
C. The small elevation above tidewater, which makes unsafe and unsanitary the use of
cesspools, septic tanks, tile fields and other facilities for sewage disposal, requires
direct connection with properly designed and maintained sewage disposal plants
and causes stormwater drains to back up and operate unsatisfactorily during periods
of high tides, storms and heavy rainfall. For these reasons and other reasons, the
Board of Trustees finds that it is expedient and desirable, for the good government
of the Village, its management and business, the protection of its property, the
safety and health of its inhabitants, the protection of their property, the preservation
and protection of the public streets, the preservation of public health and the
regulating of the construction, alteration, removal and inspection of all buildings
and structures erected or to be erected herein, that the provisions of this chapter be
enacted and made applicable to the area hereinbefore described, in addition to the
requirements of the several ordinances, rules and regulations applicable generally
throughout the Village.

requirements of this chapter and a time schedule therefor. It shall also contain such
additional data as may be required by the Board of Trustees or the Planning Board.
§ 86-5. Public hearings on plans.
The Board of Trustees may, in its discretion, hold a public hearing in relation to any
plan submitted for its approval as provided in this chapter, upon such notice as it may
determine, at which public hearing the developer and all persons interested may have an
opportunity to be heard.
§ 86-6. Imposition of conditions on plan.
The Board of Trustees may impose such conditions on the approval of any development
plan that it may deem necessary to assure that the development will be carried out in
accordance with the plan and in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Such
conditions may include requirements as to the manner in which the work shall be
performed and the order in which the various portions thereof shall be carried out, the
dedication to the Village free and clear of encumbrances of all streets, sanitary sewers,
sewage pumping stations, sewage disposal plants, stormwater drains, catch basins and
appertaining structures and any control strips, access strips, rights-of-way, easements
and other facilities.
§ 86-7. Surety bond.
The Board of Trustees may also require the developer to furnish a surety bond, in form,
amount and content satisfactory to the Board, not exceeding the estimated cost of the
work, including bulkheads. Such bond may be in addition to any bond that the Planning
Board or the Board of Trustees may require under Article 7 of the Village Law. The
Board of Trustees may, however, permit said bonds to be consolidated or a single bond
given to cover the entire work and improvement.
§ 86-8. Approval to be noted and recorded.
The approval of the Board of Trustees shall be noted on the face of the development plan
and entered in the minutes of the Board.
§ 86-9. Compliance required.

ARTICLE I
Statutory Authorization and Purpose
§ 94-1. Findings.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Lawrence finds that the potential and/or actual
damages from flooding and erosion may be a problem to the residents of the Village of
Lawrence and that such damages may include destruction or loss of private and public
housing, damage to public facilities, both publicly and privately owned, and injury to
and loss of human life. In order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve
the purposes and objectives hereinafter set forth, this chapter is adopted.
§ 94-2. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare
and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by
provisions designed to:
§ 94-3. Objectives.
The objectives of this chapter are:
A. Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or
erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights
or velocities;
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses,
be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
C. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective
barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
D. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase
erosion or flood damages;
E. Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert
floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and
F. Qualify for and maintain participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.
A. To protect human life and health;
B. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects;
C. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and
generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains,
electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special
flood hazard;
F. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development
§ 94-1 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION § 94-3
94:3
of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;
G. To provide that developers are notified that property is in an area of special flood
hazard; and
H. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.

ARTICLE II
Terminology
§ 94-4. Definitions.
A. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be
interpreted so as to give them the meanings they have in common usage and to give
this chapter its most reasonable application.
B. As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
APPEALA request for a review of the local administrator's interpretation of any
provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
AREA OF MODERATE WAVE ACTION  The portion of the SFHA landward
of a V Zone or landward of an open coast without mapped V Zones, in which
the principal sources of flooding are astronomical tides, storm surges, seiches, or
tsunamis, not riverine sources. Areas of moderate wave action may be subject to
wave effects, velocity flows, erosion, scour, or combinations of these forces and are
treated as V Zones. The area of moderate wave action is an area within a Zone AE
that is bounded by a line labeled "Limit of Moderate Wave Action."
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO, AH or VO Zone on
a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one-percent or greater
annual chance of flooding to an average annual depth of one to three feet, where a
clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable,
and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding
or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  The land in the floodplain within a
community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
This area may be designated as Zone A, AE, AH, AO, A1-A30, A99, V, VO, VE, or
V1-V30. It is also commonly referred to as the "base floodplain" or "one-hundredyear
floodplain." For purposes of this chapter, the term "special flood hazard area
(SFHA)" is synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard."
BASE FLOOD  The flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENTThat portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
BREAKAWAY WALL  A wall that is not part of the structural support of the
building and is intended, through its design and construction, to collapse under
specific lateral loading forces without causing damage to the elevated portion of the
building or the supporting foundation system.
BUILDING  See "structure."
CELLAR  Has the same meaning as "basement."
COASTAL HIGH-HAZARD AREA  An area of special flood hazard extending
from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and
any other area subject to high-velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources.
The area is designated on a FIRM as Zone V1-V30, VE, VO or V. The coastal high-
§ 94-4 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION § 94-4
94:5
hazard area shall also include areas on a FIRM within Zone AE that are bounded by
a line labeled "Limit of Moderate Wave Action."
CRAWL SPACE  An enclosed area beneath the lowest elevated floor, 18 inches
or more in height, which is used to service the underside of the lowest elevated
floor. The elevation of the floor of this enclosed area, which may be of soil, gravel,
concrete or other material, must be equal to or above the lowest adjacent exterior
grade. The enclosed crawl space area shall be properly vented to allow for the
equalization of hydrostatic forces which would be experienced during periods of
flooding.
CRITICAL FACILITIES 
CUMULATIVE SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure that equals or exceeds
50% of the market value of the structure at the time of the improvement or repair
when counted cumulatively for 10 years.
DEVELOPMENT  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or
materials.
ELEVATED BUILDING  A nonbasement building built, in the case of a
building in Zone A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, or D, to have the
top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in Zone V1-30, VE, or V,
or areas of moderate wave action, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal
structure member of the elevated floor, elevated above the ground level by means
of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the
water and adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the
building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zone
A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, or D, "elevated building" also includes a
building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings
sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of Zone
V1-V30, VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting
the definition of "elevated building" even though the lower area is enclosed by
means of breakaway walls that meet the federal standards.
FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY  The federal agency
that administers the National Flood Insurance Program.
Structures or facilities that produce, use, or store highly volatile, flammable,
explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials;

floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade
or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special
flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Village, any officer
or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency for any flood
damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.

Administration
§ 94-10. Designation of local administrator.
The Building Inspector is hereby appointed local administrator to administer and
implement this chapter by granting or denying floodplain development permits in
accordance with its provisions.
§ 94-11. Floodplain development permit.
A. Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for all construction
and other development to be undertaken in areas of special flood hazard in this
community for the purpose of protecting its citizens from increased flood hazards
and ensuring that new development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its
exposure to flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any development in an area
of special flood hazard, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map enumerated in
§ 94-6, without a valid floodplain development permit. Application for a permit
shall be made on forms furnished by the local administrator and may include but
not be limited to plans, in duplicate, drawn to scale, and showing the nature,
location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question, existing or proposed
structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the
foregoing.
B. Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be accompanied by
an application fee in an amount established from time to time by resolution of the
Board of Trustees. In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing
the Village for any additional costs necessary for review, inspection and approval
of this project. The local administrator may require a deposit of no more than
$1,000 to cover these additional costs.
C. Application for a permit. The applicant shall provide the following information, as
appropriate. Additional information may be required on the permit application
form.
(1) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor
(including basement or cellar) of any new or substantially improved structure
to be located in Zone A1-A30, AE or AH, or Zone A if base flood elevation
data are available. Upon completion of the lowest floor, the permittee shall
submit to the local administrator the as-built elevation, certified by a licensed
professional engineer or surveyor.
(2) [REMOVED SEQ FIELD]The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea
level, of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor
(excluding pilings and columns) of any new or substantially improved
structure to be located in Zone V1-V30 or VE, or Zone V if base flood
elevation data are available. Upon completion of the lowest floor, the
permittee shall submit to the local administrator the as-built elevation, certified
by a licensed professional engineer or surveyor.
(3) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any new or
§ 94-10 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION § 94-11
94:13
substantially improved nonresidential structure will be floodproofed. Upon
completion of the floodproofed portion of the structure, the permittee shall
submit to the local administrator the as-built floodproofed elevation, certified
by a professional engineer or surveyor.
(4) A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that any utility
floodproofing will meet the criteria in § 94-14C, Utilities.
(5) A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that any
nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the floodproofing criteria in
§ 94-17, Nonresidential structures.
(6) A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or
relocated as a result of proposed development. Computations by a licensed
professional engineer must be submitted that demonstrate that the altered or
relocated segment will provide equal or greater conveyance than the original
stream segment. The applicant must submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to
revise the documents enumerated in § 94-6, when notified by the local
administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA for this
purpose. The applicant must also provide assurances that the conveyance
capacity of the altered or relocated stream segment will be maintained.
(7) A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, if required by the
local administrator, which shows whether proposed development to be located
in an area of special flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other
property.
(8) In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available from other sources,
base flood elevation data shall be provided by the permit applicant for
subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including proposals
for manufactured home and recreational vehicle parks and subdivisions) that
are greater than either 50 lots or five acres.
(9) In Zones V1-V30 and VE, and also Zone V if base flood elevation are
available, or in an area of moderate wave action, designs and specifications,
certified by a licensed professional engineer or architect, for any breakaway
walls in a proposed structure with design strengths in excess of 20 pounds per
square foot.

Duties of the local administrator shall include but not be limited to the following:
A. Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the following
permit application review before issuing a floodplain development permit:
(1) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the requirements
of § 94-11C, Application for a permit, and for compliance with the provisions
and standards of this chapter.
(2) Review subdivisions and other proposed new development, including
manufactured home parks, to determine whether proposed building sites will
be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is located in an
area of special flood hazard, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall meet the applicable standards of Article V, Construction
Standards, and, in particular, § 94-13B, Subdivision proposals.
(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special flood
hazard may result in physical damage to any other property (e.g., stream bank
erosion and increased flood velocities). The local administrator may require
the applicant to submit additional technical analyses and data necessary to
complete the determination. If the proposed development may result in
physical damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
Article V, Construction Standards, no permit shall be issued. The applicant
may revise the application to include measures that mitigate or eliminate the
adverse effects and resubmit the application.
(4) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from those
governmental agencies from which approval is required by state or federal
law.
B. Use of other flood data.
(1) When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has designated areas of
special flood hazard on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
but has neither produced water surface elevation data (these areas are
designated Zone A or V on the FIRM) nor identified a floodway, the local
administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source,
including data developed pursuant to § 94-11C(7), as criteria for requiring that
new construction, substantial improvements or other proposed development
meets the requirements of this chapter.
(2) When base flood elevation data are not available, the local administrator may
use flood information from any other authoritative source, such as historical
data, to establish flood elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for
the purposes of this chapter.
C. Alteration of watercourses. The local administrator shall:
(1) Provide notification to adjacent communities and the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting any alteration

altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying
capacity is not diminished.
D. Construction stage. The local administrator shall:
(1) In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood elevation data
are available, upon placement of the lowest floor or completion of
floodproofing of a new or substantially improved structure, obtain from the
permit holder a certification of the as-built elevation of the lowest floor or
floodproofed elevation, in relation to mean sea level. The certificate shall be
prepared by or under the direct supervision of a licensed land surveyor or
professional engineer and certified by same. For manufactured homes, the
permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation upon placement of the
structure on the site. A certificate of elevation must also be submitted for a
recreational vehicle if it remains on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer
(unless it is fully licensed and ready for highway use).
(2) In Zones V1-V30 and VE, and also Zone V if base flood elevation data are
available, or in an area of moderate wave action, upon placement of the lowest
floor of a new or substantially improved structure, the permit holder shall
submit to the local administrator a certificate of elevation, in relation to mean
sea level, of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor
(excluding pilings and columns). The certificate shall be prepared by or under
the direct supervision of a licensed land surveyor or professional engineer and
certified by same. For manufactured homes, the permit holder shall submit the
certificate of elevation upon placement of the structure on the site. An
elevation certificate must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it
remains on a site 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is fully licensed and
ready for highway use).
(3) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval of the
certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local administrator shall
review all data submitted. Deficiencies detected shall be cause to issue a stopwork
order for the project unless immediately corrected.
E. Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's engineer or architect
shall make periodic inspections at appropriate times throughout the period of
construction in order to monitor compliance with permit conditions and enable said
inspector to certify, if requested, that the development is in compliance with the
requirements of the floodplain development permit and/or any variance provisions.
F. Stop-work orders.
(1) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a stop-work order for
any floodplain development found ongoing without a development permit.
Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject the violator to the penalties
described in § 94-8 of this chapter.
§ 94-12 LAWRENCE CODE § 94-12
94:16
(2) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a stop-work order for
any floodplain development found noncompliant with the provisions of this
chapter and/or the conditions of the development permit. Disregard of a stopwork
order shall subject the violator to the penalties described in § 94-8 of this
chapter.

new construction, substantial improvements or other development (including
fill) shall be permitted unless:
(a) The applicant demonstrates that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base
flood more than one foot at any location; or
(b) The Village agrees to apply to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) for a conditional FIRM revision, FEMA approval is
received and the applicant provides all necessary data, analyses and
mapping and reimburses the Village for all fees and other costs in relation
to the application. The applicant must also provide all data, analyses and
mapping and reimburse the Village for all costs related to the final map
revision.
(2) On streams with a regulatory floodway, as shown on the Flood Boundary and
§ 94-13 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION § 94-13
94:19
§ 94-14. Standards for all structures.
Floodway Map or the Flood Insurance Rate Map adopted in § 94-6, no new
construction, substantial improvements or other development in the floodway
(including fill) shall be permitted unless:
(a) A technical evaluation by a licensed professional engineer shows that
such an encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels
during occurrence of the base flood; or
(b) The Village agrees to apply to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision, FEMA
approval is received and the applicant provides all necessary data,
analyses and mapping and reimburses the Village for all fees and other
costs in relation to the application. The applicant must also provide all
data, analyses and mapping and reimburse the Village for all costs related
to the final map revisions.
(3) Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for development, the
volume of space occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base
flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically
equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood elevation at
or adjacent to the development site. All such excavations shall be constructed
to drain freely to the watercourse. No area below the waterline of a pond or
other body of water can be credited as a compensating excavation.
A. Anchoring. New structures and substantial improvements to structures in areas of
special flood hazard shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement during the base flood. This requirement is in addition to applicable state
and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
B. Construction materials and methods.
(1) New construction and substantial improvements to structures shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
(2) New construction and substantial improvements to structures shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
(3) For enclosed areas below the lowest floor of a structure within Zone A1-A30,
AE or AH, and also Zone A if base flood elevation data are available, new and
substantially improved structures shall have fully enclosed areas below the
lowest floor that are useable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding
designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls
by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.
(a) Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
licensed professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
[1] A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than
§ 94-13 LAWRENCE CODE § 94-14
94:20
§ 94-15. Residential structures (except coastal high-hazard areas).
one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided; and
[2] The bottom of all such openings shall be no higher than one foot
above the lowest adjacent finished grade.
(b) Openings may be equipped with louvers, valves, screens or other
coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters. Enclosed areas subgrade on all sides are considered
basements and are not permitted.
(4) Within Zones V1-V30 and VE, and also within Zone V if base flood elevation
are available, or in an area of moderate wave action, new construction and
substantial improvements shall have the space below the lowest floor either
free from obstruction or constructed with nonsupporting breakaway walls,
open wood lattice-work or insect screening intended to collapse under wind
and water loads without causing collapse, displacement, or other structural
damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation
system. The enclosed space below the lowest floor shall be used only for
parking vehicles, building access or storage. Use of this space for human
habitation is expressly prohibited. The construction of stairs, stairwells and
elevator shafts is subject to the design requirements for breakaway walls.
C. Utilities.
(1) New and replacement electrical equipment, heating, ventilating, airconditioning,
plumbing connections, and other service equipment shall be
located at or above the base flood elevation or be designed to prevent water
from entering and accumulating within the components during a flood and to
resist hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and stresses. Electrical wiring and
outlets, switches, junction boxes and panels shall be elevated to or above the
base flood elevation unless they conform to the appropriate provisions of the
electrical part of the Building Code of New York State or the Residential Code
of New York State for location of such items in wet locations.
(2) New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
(3) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters. Sanitary sewer and storm drainage
systems for buildings that have openings below the base flood elevation shall
be provided with automatic backflow valves or other automatic backflow
devices that are installed in each discharge line passing through a building's
exterior wall.
(4) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them
or contamination from them during flooding.
A. Elevation. The following standards apply to new and substantially improved
residential structures located in areas of special flood hazard, in addition to the
§ 94-14 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION § 94-15
94:21
§ 94-16. Residential structures (coastal high-hazard areas).
The following standards, in addition to the standards in § 94-13A, Coastal high-hazard
areas, and § 94-13B, Subdivision proposals, and § 94-14, Standards for all structures,
apply to new and substantially improved residential structures located in areas of special
flood hazard shown as Zone V1-V30, VE or V, or in an area of moderate wave action,
on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map designated in § 94-6.
requirements in § 94-13B, Subdivision proposals, and § 94-13C, Encroachments,
and § 94-14, Standards for all structures.
(1) Within Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood elevation
data are available, new construction and substantial improvements shall have
the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above two feet above the
base flood elevation.
(2) Within Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available, new and
substantially improved structures shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade.
(3) Within Zone AO, new and substantially improved structures shall have the
lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at
least as high as two feet above the depth number specified in feet on the
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map enumerated in § 94-6 (at least two feet
if no depth number is specified).
(4) Within Zones AH and AO, adequate drainage paths are required to guide
floodwaters around and away from proposed structures on slopes.
A. Elevation. New construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated on
pilings, columns or shear walls such that the bottom of the lowest horizontal
structural member supporting the lowest elevated floor (excluding columns, piles,
diagonal bracing attached to the piles or columns, grade beams, pile caps and other
members designed to either withstand storm action or break away without
imparting damaging loads to the structure) is elevated to or above two feet above
the base flood elevation so as not to impede the flow of water.
B. Determination of loading forces. Structural design shall consider the effects of wind
and water loads acting simultaneously during the base flood on all building
components.
(1) The structural design shall be adequate to resist water forces that would occur
during the base flood. Horizontal water loads considered shall include inertial
and drag forces of waves, current drag forces, and impact forces from waterborne
storm debris. Dynamic uplift loads shall also be considered if bulkheads,
walls, or other natural or man-made flow obstructions could cause wave runup
beyond the elevation of the base flood.
(2) Buildings shall be designed and constructed to resist the forces due to wind
pressure. Wind forces on the superstructure include windward and leeward
forces on vertical walls, uplift on the roof, internal forces when openings allow
wind to enter the house, and upward force on the underside of the house when
§ 94-15 LAWRENCE CODE § 94-16
94:22
it is exposed. In the design, the wind should be assumed to blow potentially
from any lateral direction relative to the house.
(3) Wind-loading values used shall be those required by the Building Code.
C. Foundation standards.
(1) The pilings or column foundation and structure attached thereto shall be
adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement due to the
effects of wind and water pressures acting simultaneously on all building
components. Foundations must be designed to transfer safely to the underlying
soil all loads due to wind, water, dead load, live load and other loads (including
uplift due to wind and water).
(2) Spread footings and fill material shall not be used for structural support of a
new building or substantial improvement of an existing structure.
D. Pile foundation design.
(1) The design ratio of pile spacing to pile diameter shall not be less than 8:1 for
individual piles. (This shall not apply to pile clusters located below the design
grade.) The maximum center-to-center spacing of wood piles shall not be more
than 12 feet on center under load-bearing sills, beams, or girders.
(2) Pilings shall have adequate soil penetration (bearing capacity) to resist the
combined wave and wind loads (lateral and uplift) associated with the base
flood acting simultaneously with typical structure (live and dead) loads and
shall include consideration of decreased resistance capacity caused by erosion
of soil strata surrounding the piles. The minimum penetration for foundation
piles is to an elevation of five feet below mean sea level (msl) datum if the
BFE is +10 msl or less, or to be at least 10 feet below msl if the BFE is greater
than +10 msl.
(3) Pile foundation analysis shall also include consideration of piles in column
action from the bottom of the structure to the stable soil elevation of the site.
Pilings may be horizontally or diagonally braced to withstand wind and water
forces.
(4) The minimum acceptable sizes for timber piles are a tip diameter of eight
inches for round timber piles and 8 x 8 inches for square timber piles. All
woodpiles must be treated in accordance with requirements of EPEE-C3 to
minimize decay and damage from fungus.
(5) Reinforced concrete piles shall be cast of concrete having a twenty-eight-day
ultimate compressive strength of not less than 5,000 pounds per square inch
and shall be reinforced with a minimum of four longitudinal steel bars having
a combined area of not less than 1% nor more than 4% of the gross concrete
area. Reinforcing for precast piles shall have a concrete cover of not less than
1 1/4 inches for No. 5 bars and smaller and not less than 1 1/2 inches for No. 6
through No. 11 bars. Reinforcement for piles cast in the field shall have a
concrete cover of not less than two inches.
(6) Piles shall be driven by means of a pile driver or drop hammer, jetted or
§ 94-16 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION § 94-16
94:23
augered into place.
(7) Additional support for piles in the form of bracing may include lateral or
diagonal bracing between piles.
(8) When necessary, piles shall be braced at the ground line in both directions by
a wood timber grade beam or a reinforced concrete grade beam. These at-grade
supports should be securely attached to the piles to provide support even if
scoured from beneath.
(9) Diagonal bracing between piles, consisting of two-inch by eight-inch
(minimum) members bolted to the piles, shall be limited in location to below
the lowest supporting structural member and above the stable soil elevation,
and aligned in the vertical plane along pile rows perpendicular to the shoreline.
Galvanized steel rods (minimum diameter 1/2 inch) or cable-type bracing is
permitted in any plane.
(10) Knee braces, which stiffen both the upper portion of a pile and the beam-topile
connection, may be used along pile rows perpendicular and parallel to the
shoreline. Knee braces shall be 2 x 8 lumber bolted to the sides of the pile/
beam, or 4 x 4 or larger braces framed into the pile/beam. Bolting shall consist
of two five-eighths-inch galvanized steel bolts (each end) for 2 x 8 members
or one five-eighths-inch lag bolt (each end) for square members. Knee braces
shall not extend more than three feet below the elevation of the base flood.
E. Column foundation design.
(1) Masonry piers or poured-in-place concrete piers shall be internally reinforced
to resist vertical and lateral loads and shall be connected with a movementresisting
connection to a pile cap or pile shaft.
F. Connectors and fasteners.
(1) Galvanized metal connectors, wood connectors, or bolts of size and number
adequate for the calculated loads must be used to connect adjoining
components of a structure. Toe-nailing as a principal method of connection is
not permitted. All metal connectors and fasteners used in exposed locations
shall be steel, hot-dipped galvanized after fabrication. Connectors in protected
interior locations shall be fabricated from galvanized sheet.
G. Beam-to-pile connections.
(1) The primary floor beams or girders shall span the supports in the direction
parallel to the flow of potential floodwater and wave action and shall be
fastened to the columns or pilings by bolting, with or without cover plates.
Concrete members shall be connected by reinforcement, if cast-in-place, or (if
precast) shall be securely connected by bolting and welding. If sills, beams, or
girders are attached to wood piling at a notch, a minimum of two five-eighthsinch
galvanized steel bolts or two hot-dipped galvanized straps 3/16 inch by
four inches by 18 inches each bolted with two one-half-inch lag bolts per beam
member shall be used. Notching of pile tops shall be the minimum sufficient
to provide ledge support for beam members without unduly weakening pile
§ 94-16 LAWRENCE CODE § 94-16
94:24
connections. Piling shall not be notched so that the cross section is reduced
below 50%.
H. Floor and deck connections.
(1) Wood 2 x 4 inch (minimum) connectors or metal joist anchors shall be used to
tie floor joists to floor beams/girders. These should be installed on alternate
floor joists, at a minimum. Cross bridging of all floor joists shall be provided.
Such cross bridging may be 1 x 3 inch members, placed eight feet on center
maximum, or solid bridging of same depth as the joist at the same spacing.
(2) Plywood should be used for subflooring and attic flooring to provide good
torsional resistance in the horizontal plane of the structure. The plywood
should not be less than three-fourths-inch total thickness and should be
exterior grade and fastened to beams or joists with 8d annular- or spiral-thread
galvanized nails. Such fastening shall be supplemented by the application of
waterproof industrial adhesive applied to all bearing surfaces.
I. Exterior wall connections.
(1) All bottom plates shall have any required breaks under a wall stud or an anchor
bolt. Approved anchors will be used to secure rafters or joists and top and
bottom plates to studs in exterior and bearing walls to form a continuous tie.
Continuous fifteen-thirty-seconds-inch or thicker plywood sheathing 
overlapping the top wall plate and continuing down to the sill, beam, or girder
 may be used to provide the continuous tie. If the sheets of plywood are not
vertically continuous, then 2 x 4 nailer blocking shall be provided at all
horizontal joints. In lieu of the plywood, galvanized steel rods of one-half-inch
diameter or galvanized steel straps not less than one inch wide by 1/16 inch
thick may be used to connect from the top wall plate to the sill, beam, or girder.
Washers with a minimum diameter of three inches shall be used at each end of

the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community;
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not
subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain
management program of that area;
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
(10) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with conducting
search and rescue operations during periods of flooding;
(11) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of

§ 94-21. Conditions for variances.
E. Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection D of this section and the purposes
of this chapter, the Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
F. The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions, including
technical information, and report any variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size contiguous to and
surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood
elevation, provided that the items in § 94-20D(1) through (12) have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon
a determination that:
(1) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as an historic structure; and
(2) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use, provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D, E and F of this section are met; and
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize
flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threat to public
safety.
D. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in
flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased
flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public
expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
§ 94-20 LAWRENCE CODE § 94-21
94:30
G. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the lowest floor
below the base flood elevation shall be given written notice over the signature of a
community official that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the
increased risk resulting from the lowest floor elevation.

§ 98-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Freshwater Wetlands Protection Law of the Village
of Lawrence."
§ 98-2. Declaration of policy.
It is declared to be the public policy of the Village to preserve, protect and conserve
freshwater wetlands and the benefits derived therefrom, to prevent the despoliation and
destruction of freshwater wetlands and to regulate the development of such wetlands in
order to secure the natural benefits of freshwater wetlands, consistent with the general
welfare and beneficial economic, social and agricultural development of the Village. It
is further declared to be the policy of the Village to exercise its authority pursuant to
Article 24 of the State Environmental Conservation Law.
§ 98-3. Findings.
A. The freshwater wetlands located in the Village are invaluable resources for flood
protection, wildlife habitat, open space and water resources.
B. Freshwater wetlands are in jeopardy of being lost, despoiled or impaired by
unregulated acts of draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution or
other acts inconsistent with the natural uses of such.
C. Recurrent flooding aggravated or caused by the loss of freshwater wetlands has
serious effects upon natural ecosystems.
D. Freshwater wetlands conservation is a matter of Village concern.
E. Any loss of freshwater wetlands deprives the people of the Village of some or all of
the many and multiple benefits to be derived from wetlands, such as:
(1) Flood and storm control by the hydrologic absorption and storage capacity of
freshwater wetlands.
(2) Wildlife habitat by providing breeding, nesting and feeding grounds and cover
for many forms of wildlife, wildfowl and shorebirds, including migratory

changes as he may deem necessary or advisable for the safe or convenient docking
or securing of such vessels.
G. The representative of the village in charge of the Basin also has authority to shift
the dock lines of any vessel in case such representative shall deem such vessel to be
improperly or insufficiently secured or to be in danger from any cause or to be
obstructing any other vessel, slip or berth, and neither the village nor such
representative shall be under any liability or responsibility in so doing.

of the Basin, shall be forthwith remedied by the applicant, and the representative in
charge of the Basin shall have the right and authority forthwith to abate the same,

the Basin is prohibited.

or material so removed.

of the violation as provided in this chapter, the actual cost thereof, plus accrued
interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of the completion of the work, if
not paid by such owner prior thereto, shall be charged to the owner of such property

the manner fixed by law for the collection of taxes and, further, shall be subject to
a delinquent penalty of 6% in the event same is not paid in full on or before the date
the tax bill upon which said charge appears becomes delinquent. Sworn statements
filed in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be prima facie evidence that all
legal formalities have been complied with and that the work has been done properly
and satisfactorily, and shall be full notice to every person concerned that the amount
of the statement, plus interest, constitutes a charge against the property designated
or described in the statement, and that the same is due and collectible as provided
by law.

REMOVAL OF DOUBLE UTILITY POLES
GENERAL REFERENCES
Property maintenance  See Ch. 146. Streets and sidewalks  See Ch. 178.
§ 152-1. Findings; legislative intent.
§ 152-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
DANGEROUS/DAMAGED POLEAny utility pole that is structurally compromised
due to weather, a traffic incident, and/or age and poses a potential threat to public safety.
DOUBLE POLE/DOUBLE WOOD  Any old utility pole from which the plant has
been removed, in whole or in part, which is attached or in close proximity to a new utility
pole.
PLANT  The cables, terminals, conductors and other fixtures necessary for
transmitting electric, telephone, cable television or other telecommunications service.
PUBLIC UTILITY  Any corporation, authority, or other entity that provides electric,
A. This Village Board of Trustees hereby finds and determines that public utility
companies place poles on Village of Lawrence roads and rights-of-way to facilitate
the delivery of electric, telephone, cable television, and other telecommunications
services to the residents of the Village of Lawrence.
B. This Village Board of Trustees also finds that utility poles are frequently damaged
by traffic accidents and adverse weather conditions.
C. This Village Board of Trustees determines that public safety can be compromised
when utility lines and equipment remain affixed to weathered/damaged/old poles
for unreasonably long periods of time.
D. This Village Board of Trustees further determines that a utility's delay in removing
lines and equipment also delays the removal of the pole itself, which causes a
proliferation of aesthetically unpleasant double woods/double poles along
roadways, as well as obstructing the paths of pedestrians and travelers on sidewalks.
E. This Village Board of Trustees also finds and determines that local governments
have the authority to regulate their roads and rights-of-way to protect the public.
F. Therefore, the purpose of this chapter is to require utilities that use Village roads
and rights-of-way to promptly remove their plants, cables, lines, equipment, and
terminals from old and damaged poles and to further require the prompt removal of
double poles once all plants, cables, lines, terminals, and other fixtures have been
removed.

utility, who may be designated by the utility, by regular mail, facsimile transmission, or
electronic mail.
§ 152-3. Permit requirements.
§ 152-4. Department notification; time frame for removal.
A. No person, firm or corporation shall place or erect any pole for any purpose in or
upon any Village highway, street, road or right-of-way of said Village, or alter or
change the location of any existing pole in any Village highway, street, road or
right-of-way of said Village without first having obtained a permit from the
Superintendent of Highways.
B. Application for a permit under this section shall be made upon a form to be
provided by the Superintendent of Highways and upon payment of a permit fee to
be set by resolution of the Village Board of Trustees.
C. The Superintendent of Highways shall include in all permits for the installation of
utility poles on Village highways, streets, roads, or rights-of-way the following
provision:
(1) The permit applicant shall have 60 days to remove a double pole following the
installation of a new pole. Failure to do so may result in penalties as provided
for in § 152-6 of the Village Code.
A. When the Superintendent of Highways issues a permit for the installation of a utility
pole which is directly next to or in close proximity to another utility pole in a
Village highway or right-of-way, the applicant shall have 60 days to remove the
damaged or double pole following the installation of the new pole. Failure to do so
may result in penalties as provided for in § 152-6 of this chapter.
B. When the Superintendent of Highways determines that a utility pole in a Village
road or right-of-way is damaged and poses a potential threat to public safety, the

the contribution on the POTW and develop effluent limitation(s) for such user to
correct the interference with the POTW or may order the user(s) to cease and desist
the objectionable discharge.
A. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following described
substances, materials, waters or wastes if it appears likely in the opinion of the
Superintendent that such wastes can harm either the sewers, POTW treatment
process or equipment, have an adverse effect on the receiving stream or can
otherwise endanger life, limb, public property or constitute a nuisance. In forming
his opinion as to the acceptability of these wastes, the Superintendent will give
consideration to such factors as the quantities of subject wastes in relation to flows
and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, nature of the
sewage treatment process, capacity of the POTW treatment plant, degree of
treatability of wastes in the POTW treatment plant and other pertinent factors. The
substances prohibited are:
(1) Any waters or wastes containing fats, wax, grease or oils, whether emulsified
or not, in excess of 100 mg/l or containing substances which may solidify or

sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics
enumerated in § 162-34 and which, in the judgment of the Superintendent, may
have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or receiving
waters or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the
Superintendent may:
(1) Reject the wastes.
(2) Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public
sewers.
(3) Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes
not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of
§ 162-41.
B. If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the
design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review
and approval of the Superintendent and subject to the requirements of all applicable
codes, ordinances and laws.
C. Upon the promulgation of the national categorical pretreatment standards for a
particular industrial subcategory, the national standard, if more stringent than
limitations imposed under this Sewer Code for sources in that subcategory, will
immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this Sewer Code. The
Superintendent shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting
requirements under 40 CFR 403.12. Users shall provide necessary wastewater

All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which
reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition
of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the
American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole
provided or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no
special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the
nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building
sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the POTW works and to determine the existence
of hazards to life, limb and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine
whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or
whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and
suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four-hour composites of all outfalls
whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples.)
§ 162-41. Special agreements for acceptance of certain wastes.
No statement contained in this Article shall be construed as preventing any special
agreement or arrangement between the Village and any industrial concern whereby an
industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the Village for
treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the industrial concern.

Significant industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to
comply with this Sewer Code and shall achieve compliance with all national categorical
pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the National
Pretreatment Regulations, Section 403.5(f). Any facilities required to pretreat
wastewater to a level acceptable to the Village shall be provided, operated and
maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and
operating procedures shall be submitted to the Village for review and shall be acceptable
to the Village before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the
facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the Village under the provisions
of this Sewer Code. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of
operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the Village prior to the user's initiation
of the changes.
§ 162-49. Availability of records related to pretreatment standards.
All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be made available
to officials of the EPA or approval authority upon request.
§ 162-50. Protection from accidental discharges.
Each significant industrial user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this Sewer Code. Facilities to
prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at
the significant industrial user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities
and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the Village
for review and shall be approved by the Village before construction of the facility. All
existing users shall complete such a plan within nine months of the effective date of this
Sewer Code. No significant industrial user who commences contribution to the POTW
after the effective date of this chapter shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into
the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the Village.
Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the
significant industrial user from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to
meet the requirements of this Sewer Code. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is
the responsibility of the significant industrial user to immediately telephone and notify
the Village of the incident. The notification shall include the location of the discharge,
the type of waste, concentration(s) and volume(s) and corrective action(s) taken.
§ 162-51. Notification of accidental discharge.
Within five days following an accidental discharge, the significant industrial user shall
submit to the Village a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge
and the measures to be taken by the significant industrial user to prevent similar future
occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the significant industrial user of any
expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to
§ 162-48 SEWERS AND CESSPOOLS § 162-51
162:27
the POTW or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve
the significant industrial user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be
imposed by this Sewer Code or other applicable law.
§ 162-52. Employees to be advised of accidental discharge procedures.
A notice shall be permanently posted on the significant industrial user's bulletin board
or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous
discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a
dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
§ 162-53. Report on nature and concentration of pollutants.
Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable pretreatment
standards or, in the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction
of wastewater into the POTW, any significant industrial user subject to pretreatment
standards and requirements shall submit to the Superintendent a compliance report
indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the
regulated process which are limited by pretreatment standards and requirements and the
average and maximum daily flow for these process units in the user facility which are
limited by such pretreatment standards or requirements. The report shall state whether
the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent
basis and, if not, what additional operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is
necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the user
and certified to by a qualified professional engineer licensed in the State of New York.
§ 162-54. Periodic compliance reports.
Any significant industrial user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the compliance
date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement
of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the Superintendent during the months of
June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by
the Superintendent, a periodic compliance report indicating the nature and concentration
of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards. In
addition, this report shall include a record of all daily flows during the reporting period
which exceeded the average daily flow reported under § 162-45C. At the discretion of
the Superintendent and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates,
holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Superintendent may agree to alter the months during
which the above reports are to be submitted.
§ 162-55. Mass limitations and additional regulations for certain users.
The Superintendent may impose mass limitations on significant industrial users which
are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other
cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report
required by § 162-54 shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment
standards in the effluent of the user. These report shall contain the results of sampling
and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or
production and mass where requested by the Superintendent, of pollutants contained
§ 162-51 LAWRENCE CODE § 162-55
162:28
therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of
monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standard. All analysis shall
be performed in accordance with procedures established pursuant to Section 304(g) of
the Act and contained in 40 CFR 136, and amendments thereto, or with any other test
procedures approved by the Administrator of the EPA. Sampling shall be performed in
accordance with the techniques approved by the Administrator of the EPA. (Comment:
Where 40 CFR 136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant
in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures
set forth in the EPA publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of
Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with
any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the Administrator of the

could lead to any of the other failure conditions as noted in this section.
F. Contamination of off-site groundwater.
A. Activities that are subject to the requirements of this section are those types of
activities that:
(1) Cause or contribute to a violation of the municipality's MS4 SPDES permit.
(2) Cause or contribute to the municipality being subject to the special conditions
as defined in § 176-2, Definitions, of this article.
B. Such activities include failing individual sewage treatment systems as defined in
§ 176-7, improper management of pet waste or any other activity that causes or
contributes to violations of the municipality's MS4 SPDES permit authorization.
C. Upon notification to a person that he or she is engaged in activities that cause or
contribute to violations of the municipality's MS4 SPDES permit authorization, that
person shall take all reasonable actions to correct such activities such that he or she
no longer causes or contributes to violations of the municipality's MS4 SPDES
permit authorization.
A. Best management practices. Where the SMO has identified illicit discharges as
defined in § 176-2 or activities contaminating stormwater as defined in § 176-8, the
municipality may require implementation of best management practices (BMPs) to
control those illicit discharges and activities.
(1) The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at his or her own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the MS4 through the use
of structural and nonstructural BMPs.
(2) Any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be, the
source of an illicit discharge as defined in § 176-2 or an activity contaminating
stormwater as defined in § 176-8, may be required to implement, at said
person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to reduce or
eliminate the source of pollutant(s) to the MS4.
(3) Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid SPDES permit authorizing
the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent
practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section.
B. Individual sewage treatment systems; response to special conditions requiring no
increase of pollutants or requiring a reduction of pollutants. Where individual
sewage treatment systems are contributing to the municipality's being subject to the
special conditions as defined in § 176-2 of this article, the owner or operator of such
individual sewage treatment systems shall be required to:
§ 176-7 LAWRENCE CODE § 176-9
176:8
§ 176-10. Suspension of access to MS4; illicit discharges in emergency situations.
(1) Maintain and operate individual sewage treatment systems as follows:
(a) Inspect the septic tank annually to determine scum and sludge
accumulation. Septic tanks must be pumped out whenever the bottom of
the scum layer is within three inches of the bottom of the outlet baffle or
sanitary tee or the top of the sludge is within 10 inches of the bottom of
the outlet baffle or sanitary tee;
(b) Avoid the use of septic tank additives;
(c) Avoid the disposal of excessive quantities of detergents, kitchen wastes,
laundry wastes, and household chemicals; and
(d) Avoid the disposal of cigarette butts, disposable diapers, sanitary napkins,
trash and other such items.
(2) Repair or replace individual sewage treatment systems as follows:
(a) In accordance with 10 NYCRR Appendix 75A to the maximum extent
practicable.
(b) A design professional licensed to practice in New York State shall
prepare design plans for any type of absorption field that involves:

previously approved for such.
[2] Installation of a new subsurface treatment system at the same
location.
[3] Use of alternate system or innovative system design or technology.
(c) A written certificate of compliance shall be submitted by the design
professional to the municipality at the completion of construction of the
repair or replacement system.
A. The SMO may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person
when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, to the
health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4. The SMO shall notify the person of
such suspension within a reasonable time thereafter, in writing, including the
reasons for the suspension. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the SMO may take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or to minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the
municipality's MS4 in violation of this article may have his or her MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The SMO
will notify a violator in writing of the proposed termination of its MS4 access and
the reasons therefor. The violator may petition the SMO for a reconsideration and
hearing. Access may be granted by the SMO if he/she finds that the illicit discharge

§ 176-11. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity SPDES stormwater discharge
permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said
permit may be required in a form acceptable to the municipality prior to the allowing of
discharges to the MS4.
§ 176-12. Access to facilities and monitoring of discharges.
has ceased and the discharger has taken steps to prevent its recurrence. Access may
be denied if the SMO determines in writing that the illicit discharge has not ceased
or is likely to recur. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4
access to premises terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of
the SMO.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that the SMO must inspect to
enforce any provision of this article, or whenever the authorized enforcement
agency has cause to believe that there exists, or potentially exists, in or upon any
premises any condition which constitutes a violation of this article.
B. Access to facilities.
(1) The SMO shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation
under this article as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with
this article. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall
make the necessary arrangements to allow access to the SMO.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the SMO ready access to all parts of the premises
for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records
as may be required to implement this article.
(3) The municipality shall have the right to set up on any facility subject to this
article such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the SMO to conduct
monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.
(4) The municipality has the right to require the facilities subject to this article to
install monitoring equipment as is reasonably necessary to determine
compliance with this article. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment
shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the
discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow
and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(5) Unreasonable delays in allowing the municipality access to a facility subject
to this article are a violation of this article. A person who is the operator of a
facility subject to this article commits an offense if the person denies the
municipality reasonable access to the facility for the purpose of conducting
any activity authorized or required by this article.
(6) If the SMO has been refused access to any part of the premises from which
stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to

§ 176-13. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a
facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation,
has information of any known or suspected release of materials which is resulting or may
result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take
all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In
the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify
emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the
event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the municipality
in person or by telephone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications
in person or by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed
to the municipality within three business days of the telephone notice. If the discharge
of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the
owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the
discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained
for at least three years.

subsequent offense, all of which were committed within a period of five years,
punishable by a fine not less than $700 nor more than $1,000 or imprisonment for
a period not to exceed six months, or both. However, for the purposes of conferring
jurisdiction upon courts and judicial officers generally, violations of this article
shall be deemed misdemeanors and for such purpose only all provisions of law
relating to misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each week's continued
violation shall constitute a separate additional violation.
A. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the
notice of violation, then the SMO shall request the owner's permission for access to
the subject private property to take any and all measures reasonably necessary to
abate the violation and/or restore the property.
B. If refused access to the subject private property, the SMO may seek a warrant in a
court of competent jurisdiction to be authorized to enter upon the property to
determine whether a violation has occurred. Upon determination that a violation has
occurred, the SMO may seek a court order to take any and all measures reasonably
necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. The cost of
implementing and maintaining such measures shall be the sole responsibility of the
discharger.
A. Where a person has violated a provision of this article, he/she may be eligible for
alternative remedies in lieu of a civil penalty, upon recommendation of the
Municipal Attorney and concurrence of the Municipal Code Enforcement Officer,
where:
(1) The violation was unintentional.
(2) The violator has no history of previous violations of this article.
(3) Environmental damage was minimal.

General Provisions
§ 177-1. Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
§ 177-2. Purpose.
The purpose of L.L. No. 2-201464 is to establish minimum stormwater management
requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare
of the public residing within this jurisdiction and to address the findings of fact in
§ 177-1 hereof. Local Law No. 2-2014 seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the
A. Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often
alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff
rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, or sediment transport and
deposition.
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of water-borne
pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species.
C. Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to
the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat.
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can
increase the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby increasing stream bank erosion
and sedimentation.
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing
groundwater recharge and stream base flow.
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of
the municipality.
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and
minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from land development
activities.
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in
order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes,
soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with
stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health
and safety.
I. Regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards
governing stormwater management and site design will produce development
compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and
thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from
development.

is hereby imposed upon every utility doing business in the Village of Lawrence which
is subject to the supervision of the State Department of Public Service, which has a
gross income for the 12 months ending December 31 in excess of $500, except motor
carriers or brokers subject to such supervision under Article 3-B of the Public Service
Law,73 and a tax equal to 1% of its gross operating income from and after the first day of
January 1967 is hereby imposed upon every other utility doing business in the Village of
Lawrence which has a gross operating income for the 12 months ending December 31 in
excess of $500, which taxes shall have application only within the territorial limits of the
Village of Lawrence and shall be in addition to any and all other taxes and fees imposed
by any other provisions of law. Such taxes shall not be imposed on any transaction
originating or consummated outside of the territorial limits of the Village of Lawrence,
notwithstanding that some act is necessarily performed with respect to such transaction
within such limits.
§ 187-2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:

for ultimate consumption or use by the purchaser in the Village of Lawrence, including
cash, credits and property of any kind or nature, whether or not such sale is made or
such service is rendered for profit, without any deduction therefrom on account of the
cost of the property sold, the cost of the materials used, labor or services or other costs,
interest or discount paid or any other expense whatsoever; also profits from the sale
of securities; also profits from the sale of real property growing out of the ownership
or use of or interest in such property; also profit from the sale of personal property,

of Lawrence other than such as are received from a corporation, a majority of whose
voting stock is owned by the taxpaying utility, without any deduction therefrom for any
expenses whatsoever incurred in connection with the receipt thereof; and also profits
from any transaction, except sales for resale and rentals, within the Village of Lawrence
whatsoever; provided, however, that the words "gross income" shall include, in the
case of a utility engaged in selling telephony or telephone service, only receipts from

telephone or telegraph service in the Village of Lawrence, including cash, credits and

or not such person is subject to such supervision) who sells gas, electricity, steam,
water, refrigeration, telephony or telegraphy, delivered through mains, pipes or wires,
or furnishes gas, electric, steam, water, refrigerator, telephone or telegraph service by
means of mains, pipes or wires, regardless of whether such activities are the main
business of such person or are only incidental thereto or of whether use is made of the
public streets.
§ 187-3. Records to be kept by utilities.
Every utility subject to tax under this article shall keep such records of its business and in
such form as the Village Treasurer may require, and such records shall be preserved for
a period of three years, except that the Village Treasurer may consent to their destruction
within the period or may require that they be kept longer.
§ 187-4. Returns.
Every utility subject to tax hereunder shall file annually, on or before the 25th day of
January, a return for the 12 calendar months preceding such return date or any portion
thereof for which the tax imposed hereby is effective; provided, however, that, in lieu of
the annual return required by the foregoing provisions, any utility may file quarterly, on
or before April 25, July 25, October 25 and January 25, a return for the three calendar
months preceding each such return date and, in the case of the first such return, for all
preceding calendar months during which the tax imposed hereby was effective.

Village Treasurer the tax imposed by this article for the period covered by such return.
Such tax shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return or, if a return is not filed
when due, on the last day on which the return is required to be filed.

Lawrence to file an annual return, which shall contain any data specified by him,
regardless of whether the utility is subject to tax under this article.
D. Every return shall have annexed thereto an affidavit of the head of the utility
making the same or of the owner or of a copartner thereof or of a principal officer
of the corporation, if such business is conducted by a corporation, to the effect that
the statements contained therein are true.
A. In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or unsatisfactory
to the Village Treasurer, and if a corrected or sufficient return is not filed within 20
days after the same is required by notice from him, or if no return is made for any
period, the Village Treasurer shall determine the amount of tax due from such
information as he is able to obtain and, if necessary, may estimate the tax on the
basis of external indices or otherwise. He shall give notice of such determination to
the person liable for such tax.
B. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax, unless the person
against whom it is assessed shall, within 30 days after the giving of notice of such
determination, apply to the Village Treasurer for a hearing or unless the Village
Treasurer, of his own motion, shall reduce the same.
C. After such hearing, the Village Treasurer shall give notice of his decision to the
person liable for the tax. Such decision may be reviewed by a proceeding under
Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the State of New York if
application therefor is made within 90 days after the giving of notice of such
decision. An order to review such decision shall not be granted unless the amount
of any tax sought to be reviewed, with interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall
be first deposited with the Village Treasurer and an undertaking filed with him, in
such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve,
to the effect that, if such proceeding is dismissed or the tax confirmed, the applicant
will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such
proceeding, or, at the option of the applicant, such undertaking may be in a sum
sufficient to cover the tax, interest, penalties, costs and charges aforesaid, in which
event the applicant shall not be required to pay such tax, interest and penalties as a
condition precedent to the granting of such order.
D. Except in the case of a willfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the
tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of more than
three years from the date of the filing of a return; provided, however, that, where no
return has been filed as required by this article, the tax may be assessed at any time.
§ 187-4 TAXATION § 187-7
187:5
§ 187-7. Manner of giving required notice.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may be given by
mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended in a postpaid envelope addressed
to such person at the address given by him in the last return filed by him under this article
or, if no return has been filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing
of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to
whom addressed. Any period of time, which is determined, according to the provisions
of this article, by the giving of notice, shall commence to run from the date of mailing of
such notice.
§ 187-8. Penalty for failure to file.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return or to pay any tax or any portion
thereof within the time required by this article shall be subject to a penalty of 5% of
the amount of tax due, plus 1% of such tax for each month of delay or fraction thereof,
excepting the first month, after such return was required to be filed or such tax became
due; but the Village Treasurer, for cause shown, may extend the time for filing any return
and, if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any portion of the penalty
fixed by the foregoing provisions of this section.
§ 187-9. Refunds.
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer thereof shall make
application for a refund thereof and the Village Treasurer or the court shall determine
that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof was erroneously or illegally collected,
the Village Treasurer shall refund the amount so determined. For like cause and within
the same period, a refund may be so made on the initiative of the Village Treasurer.
However, no refund shall be made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination
of the Village Treasurer as hereinbefore provided, unless the Village Treasurer, after a
hearing as hereinbefore provided or of his own motion, shall have reduced the tax or
penalty or it shall have been established, in a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil
Practice Law and Rules of the State of New York, that such determination was erroneous
or illegal. All refunds shall be made out of moneys collected under this article. An
application for a refund, made as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an application
for the revision of any tax or penalty complained of, and the Village Treasurer may
receive additional evidence with respect thereto. After making his determination, the
Village Treasurer shall give notice thereof to the person interested, and he shall be
entitled to an order to review such determination under said Article 78, subject to the
provisions herein before contained relating to the granting of such an order.
§ 187-10. Tax on operating cost.
The tax imposed by this article shall be charged against and be paid by the utility and
shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by the utility to customers or others
but shall constitute a part of the operating costs of such utility.
§ 187-11. Proceedings to enforce payment.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this article, the
Village Attorney shall, upon the request of the Village Treasurer, bring an action to
§ 187-7 LAWRENCE CODE § 187-11
187:6
enforce payment of the same. The proceeds of any judgment obtained in any such action
shall be paid to the Village Treasurer. Each such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the
property of the person liable to pay the same, in the same manner and to the same extent
that the tax and penalty imposed by § 186-a of the Tax Law is made a lien.
§ 187-12. Powers of Treasurer.
In the administration of this article, the Village Treasurer shall have the power to make
such reasonable rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law, as may be necessary for
the exercise of his powers and the performance of his duties, to prescribe the form of
blanks, reports and other records relating to the administration and enforcement of the
tax, to take testimony and proofs, under oath, with reference to any matter within the
line of his official duty under this article and to subpoena and require the attendance of
witnesses and the production of books, papers and documents.
§ 187-13. Secrecy of records.74
A. Except in accordance with proper judicial order or as otherwise provided by law, it
shall be unlawful for the Village Treasurer or any agent, clerk or employee of the
Village of Lawrence to divulge or make known, in any manner, the amount of gross
income or gross operating income or any particulars set forth or disclosed in any
return under this article. The officer charged with the custody of such returns shall
not be required to produce any of them or evidence of anything contained in them
in any action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the Village of
Lawrence, in an action or proceeding under the provisions of this article, or on
behalf of the State Tax Commission, in an action or proceeding under the provisions
of the Tax Law of the State of New York, or on behalf of any party to any action or
proceeding under the provisions of this article when the returns or facts shown
thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding, in either of which events
the court may require the production of and may admit in evidence so much of said
returns or of the facts shown thereby as are pertinent to the action or proceeding and
no more. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a person or
his duly authorized representative of a copy of any return filed by him; nor prohibit
the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular
returns and the items thereof or the publication of delinquent lists showing the
names of persons who have failed to pay their taxes at the time and in the manner
provided for by this article, together with any relevant information which, in the
opinion of the Village Treasurer, may assist in the collection of such delinquent
taxes; nor prohibit the inspection, by the Village Attorney or other legal
representatives of the Village of Lawrence, of the return of any person who shall
bring action to set aside or review the tax based thereon or against whom an action
has been instituted in accordance with the provisions of this article.
B. Any offense against the foregoing secrecy provisions shall be punishable by a fine
not exceeding $1,000 or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both, and, if
the offender is an officer, agent, clerk or employee of the Village of Lawrence, he
shall be dismissed from office and shall be incapable of holding any office or
employment in the Village of Lawrence for a period of five years thereafter.

of the Village.
C. Notwithstanding any provisions of this article, the Village Treasurer may exchange,
with the chief fiscal officer of any city or any other Village in the State of New
York, information contained in returns filed under this article, provided that such
city or other Village grants similar privileges to the Village of Lawrence, and
provided that such information is to be used for tax purposes only, and the Village
Treasurer shall, upon request, furnish the State Tax Commission with any
information contained in such returns.

WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES
GENERAL REFERENCES
Zoning  See Ch. 212.
§ 207-1. Purpose and legislative intent.
The telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed the Village of Lawrence's authority
concerning the placement, construction and modification of wireless
telecommunications facilities. The Village finds that wireless telecommunications
facilities may pose significant concerns to the health, safety, public welfare, character
and environment of the Village and its inhabitants. The Village also recognizes that
facilitating the development of wireless service technology can be an economic
development asset to the Village and of significant benefit to the Village and its
residents. In order to insure that the placement, construction or modification of wireless
telecommunications facilities is consistent with the Village's land use policies, the
Village is adopting a single, comprehensive, wireless telecommunications facilities
application and permit process. The intent of this chapter is to minimize the negative
impact of wireless telecommunications facilities, establish a fair and efficient process
for review and approval of applications, assure an integrated, comprehensive review of
environmental impacts of such facilities, and protect the health, safety and welfare of the
Village of Lawrence.
§ 207-2. Title.
This chapter shall be known and cited as the "Wireless Telecommunications Facilities
Siting Local Law for the Village of Lawrence."

chapter or any application thereof to any person or circumstance is declared void,
unconstitutional, or invalid for any reason, then such word, phrase, sentence, part,
section, subsection, or other portion, or the proscribed application thereof, shall be
severable, and the remaining provisions of this chapter, and all applications thereof,
not having been declared void, unconstitutional, or invalid, shall remain in full force
and effect.
B. Any special use permit issued under this chapter shall be comprehensive and not
severable. If part of a permit is deemed or ruled to be invalid or unenforceable in
any material respect, by a competent authority, or is overturned by a competent
authority, the permit shall be void in total, upon determination by the Village.

(4) On other properties in the Village.
B. If the proposed site is not the highest priority listed above, then a detailed
explanation must be provided as to why a site of a higher priority was not selected.
The person seeking such an exception must satisfactorily demonstrate the reason or
reasons why such a permit should be granted for the proposed site, and the hardship
that would be incurred by the applicant if the permit were not granted for the
proposed site.
C. An applicant may not bypass sites of higher priority by stating the site proposed is
the only site leased or selected. An application shall address collocation as the
preference of the Village. If such option is not proposed, the applicant must explain
to the reasonable satisfaction of the Village why collocation is commercially or
otherwise impracticable. Agreements between providers limiting or prohibiting
collocation shall not be a valid basis for any claim of commercial impracticability
or hardship.
D. Notwithstanding the above, the Village may approve any site located within an area
in the above list of priorities, provided that the Village finds that the proposed site
is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the Village and its
inhabitants and will not have a deleterious effect on the nature and character of the
community and neighborhood.
E. The applicant shall submit a written report demonstrating the applicant's review of
the above locations in order of priority, demonstrating the technological reason for
the site selection. If appropriate, based on selecting a site of lower priority, a
detailed written explanation as to why sites of a higher priority were not selected
shall be included with the application.
F. Notwithstanding that a potential site may be situated in an area of highest priority
or highest available priority, the Village may disapprove an application for any of
the following reasons:
(1) Conflict with safety and safety-related codes and requirements;

wireless telecommunications facilities may not use the payment of fines, liquidated
damages or other penalties to evade or avoid compliance with this chapter or any
section of this chapter. An attempt to do so shall subject the holder of the special
use permit to termination and revocation of the special use permit. The Village may
also seek injunctive relief to prevent the continued violation of this chapter, without

then the Village may revoke such special use permit for wireless
telecommunications facilities, and shall notify the holder of the special use permit
within 48 hours of such action.
A. Under the following circumstances, the Village may determine that the health,
safety, and welfare interests of the Village warrant and require the removal of
wireless telecommunications facilities:
(1) Wireless telecommunications facilities with a permit have been abandoned
(i.e., not used as wireless telecommunications facilities) for a period exceeding
90 days or a total of 180 days in any three-hundred-sixty-five-day period,
except for periods caused by force majeure or acts of God, in which case,
repair or removal shall commence within 90 days;
(2) Permitted wireless telecommunications facilities fall into such a state of
disrepair that they create a health or safety hazard;
(3) Wireless telecommunications facilities have been located, constructed, or
modified without first obtaining, or in a manner not authorized by, the required
special use permit, or any other necessary authorization.
B. If the Village makes such a determination as noted in Subsection A of this section,
then the Village shall notify the holder of the special use permit for the wireless
telecommunications facilities within 48 hours that said wireless
telecommunications facilities are to be removed; the Village may approve an
interim temporary use agreement/permit, such as to enable the sale of the wireless
telecommunications facilities.
C. The holder of the special use permit, or its successors or assigns, shall dismantle
and remove such wireless telecommunications facilities, and all associated
structures and facilities, from the site and restore the site to as close to its original

commercial impracticability, within 90 days of receipt of written notice from the
Village. However, if the owner of the property upon which the wireless
telecommunications facilities are located wishes to retain any access roadway to the
wireless telecommunications facilities, the owner may do so with the approval of
the Board of Trustees.
D. If wireless telecommunications facilities are not removed or substantial progress
has not been made to remove the wireless telecommunications facilities within 90
days after the permit holder has received notice, then the Village may order officials
or representatives of the Village to remove the wireless telecommunications
facilities at the sole expense of the owner or special use permit holder.
E. If, the Village removes, or causes to be removed, wireless telecommunications
facilities, and the owner of the wireless telecommunications facilities does not
claim and remove it from the site to a lawful location within 10 days, then the
Village may take steps to declare the wireless telecommunications facilities
abandoned, and sell them and their components.

Any applicant or permittee desiring relief, waiver or exemption from any aspect or
requirement of this chapter may request such at the pre-application meeting, provided
that the relief or exemption is contained in the original application for either a special use
permit or, in the case of an existing or previously granted special use permit, a request for
modification of its tower and/or facilities. Such relief may be temporary or permanent,
partial or complete. However, the burden of proving the need for the requested relief,
waiver or exemption is solely on the applicant. No such relief or exemption shall be
approved unless the applicant demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that, if
granted, the relief, waiver or exemption will have no significant effect on the health,
safety and welfare of the Village, its residents and other service providers.

F. Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the Village may approve a
temporary use permit/agreement for the wireless telecommunications facilities, for
no more than 90 days, during which time a suitable plan for removal, conversion,
or relocation of the affected wireless telecommunications facilities shall be
developed by the holder of the special use permit, subject to the approval of the
Village, and an agreement to such plan shall be executed by the holder of the special
use permit and the Village. If such a plan is not developed, approved and executed
within the ninety-day time period, then the Village may take possession of and
dispose of the affected wireless telecommunications facilities in the manner
provided in this section.
A. The Village may at any time conduct a review and examination of this entire
chapter.
B. If, after such a periodic review and examination of this chapter, the Village
determines that one or more provisions of this chapter should be amended, repealed,
revised, clarified, or deleted, then the Village may take whatever measures are
necessary in accordance with applicable local law in order to accomplish the same.
It is noted that where warranted, and in the best interests of the Village, the Village
may repeal this entire chapter at any time.
C. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsections A and B of this section, the Village
may at any time, and in any manner (to the extent permitted by federal, state, or
local law), amend, add, repeal, and/or delete one or more provisions of this chapter.
A. To the extent that the holder of a special use permit for wireless
telecommunications facilities has not received relief, or is otherwise exempt, from
appropriate state and/or federal agency rules or regulations, then the holder of such
a special use permit shall adhere to, and comply with, all applicable rules,
regulations, standards, and provisions of any state or federal agency, including, but

state or federal agency, including, but not limited to, the FAA and the FCC, and
specifically including any rules and regulations regarding height, lighting, and
security, are changed and/or are modified during the duration of a special use permit
for wireless telecommunications facilities, then the holder of such a special use

§ 212-13 LAWRENCE CODE § 212-13.1
212:12
Woodmere Club (CC-WC)."
B. Purpose.
(1) The purpose of this section, in coordination with the contiguous neighboring
Town of Hempstead ("Town") and Village of Woodsburgh, is to regulate
development in the environmentally sensitive coastal areas that span the
municipal boundaries of the Village and the contiguous Town and Village of
Woodsburgh, including the area occupied by the Woodmere Club, allowing
for the enhanced preservation and protection of the Village's and neighboring
Town and Village of Woodsburgh's environmental, coastal, open space,
natural and cultural resources and the preservation of the residential
neighborhoods, both within the Village, the Village of Woodsburgh and the
unincorporated areas of the Town, in and about the former Woodmere Club.
(2) In the low-lying southern coastal areas of the Village and the adjacent
contiguous Town and Village there are located golf courses that have been in
place for more than a century, which open spaces provide not only recreation
but a natural mitigation against adverse impacts on the environment and,
therefore, the well-being and safety of the entire region.
(3) Climate change is becoming the defining environmental issue of our time,
particularly for vulnerable, low-lying coastal areas. This change has taken
shape already, in the form of more frequent and intense storms, sea level rise
and extreme flooding. It is no longer a future endeavor, but rather a sound
planning imperative that the Village, the Town and the Village of
Woodsburgh, immediately address ongoing and future conditions, including
greater risks of flooding presented by sea level rise and enhanced storm surge,
inland flooding expected to result from increasingly frequent extreme
precipitation events and the increased risk of compound flooding, resulting
from simultaneous storm surge and heavy precipitation. Through proper and
coordinated regulation, the Village intends to do its part in preserving the
health, safety, and well-being of residents in the area of the Woodmere Club
and the surrounding community.
(4) Along the coast, and particularly in low-lying coastal areas, it is imperative
that the Village, Town and the Village of Woodsburgh, as stewards of the
environment and protectors of their community safety, health and welfare,
assure that flood risk mitigation measures effectively preserve the floodplain
and surrounding areas. As the Department of Environmental Conservation has
expressed, the goal of managing the floodplain is not only to ensure that new
development is reasonably safe from flooding, but to address existing risks, to
avoid increasing risk to others and to sustain natural capacities to slow and
diffuse flood flows. Reducing development in flood-prone areas allows the
natural landscape to absorb more floodwaters, reduce flooding to adjacent
areas, recharge groundwater and sustain a healthy ecosystem.
(5) As a result of declining golf participation and membership at eighteen-hole
golf clubs, golf courses are closing, including the Woodmere Club. The land
of the Woodmere Club ("the Woodmere Club property") is approximately
118.4 acres in size and is located partially in the Village (approximately 22.9
§ 212-13.1 ZONING § 212-13.1
212:13
acres), the Town (approximately 55 acres) and Village of Woodsburgh
(approximately 40.5 acres).
(6) As a result, this large and mostly open coastal area, spanning the boundaries
of these three contiguous municipalities, is vulnerable to residential and
commercial development, seriously threatening both this environmentally
sensitive coastal area, and the well-being of the Village, the Town, the Village
of Woodsburgh and the region as a whole, and which potential adverse impacts
and loss of existing open space will not be adequately mitigated by existing
and inconsistent zoning regulations in both the contiguous Town and Villages
with respect to permissible development, lot size, lot coverage, density,
building height and site-specific development regulations.
(7) It is the belief of the Village, in coordination with the contiguous Town and
Village of Woodsburgh, that, unless addressed, the loss of this existing open
space to over-development in the environmentally sensitive coastal area of the
Village presents an immediate threat to the public health and safety of the
Village, the adjacent Town and Village of Woodsburgh, and the region as a
whole, and can best be mitigated, and the additional benefits accomplished,
with the coordinated creation of matching complementary Coastal
Conservation District[s] in each municipality in conjunction with the adjacent
contiguous Town and Village of Woodsburgh.
(8) The Woodmere Club property is located in a relatively vulnerable, low-lying
coastal area, well within a special flood hazard area (100-year floodplain) and
the New York State Coastal Boundary Area. The Woodmere Club property is
also impacted by shallow groundwater conditions. The New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation (NYS DEC) has identified the
presence of significant natural communities and rare plants and animals at the
Woodmere Club property. The Woodmere Club property has also been
identified by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic
Preservation (OPRHP) as a potentially archeologically sensitive area. Given
the presence of these environmental and cultural resources, the Village intends
to provide for a cluster development, in accordance with Village Law § 7-738,
with reduced lot size requirements, in this area to properly conserve and
protect the low-lying, vulnerable coastal area and natural area and resources.
(9) A traditional subdivision layout with a minimum lot size of 40,000 square feet
within the approximately twenty-two-and-nine-tenths-acre Village portion of
the course would have a gross yield of approximately 21 lots, but the net yield
would be reduced significantly when accounting for area regulations, open
space and/or parkland preservation, roadway and infrastructure elements and
reserved drainage areas. Cluster-style development provided herein and in the
contiguous Town and Village of Woodsburgh portions of the Woodmere Club
property provides for the preservation of some of the most sensitive
environmental portions of the property, while permitting sustainable
residential development utilizing a cluster subdivision technique within all
three municipalities. Sustainable design elements will be required in all
residential development applications, incorporating a sustainable approach
and low-impact development principles.
§ 212-13.1 LAWRENCE CODE § 212-13.1
212:14
(10) While the Village recognizes its responsibility to provide for a properly
balanced and well-ordered plan of development and land uses within its
community, it also recognizes that, in enacting local zoning, consideration
must be given to regional needs and requirements, and that there must be a
balancing of the local desire to maintain the status quo within the community
and the greater public interest that regional needs be met.
(11) The New York State General Municipal Law, § 239-NN, indicates the intent
and purpose of the State of New York to encourage the coordination of land
use development and regulation among adjacent municipalities in order that
each adjacent municipality may recognize the goals and objectives of
neighboring municipalities, and as a result development occurs in a manner
which is supportive of the goals and objectives of the general area and
neighboring municipalities.
(12) Pursuant to Article 8, §§ 1 and 2-a of the New York State Constitution, as
effectuated by General Municipal Law Article 5-J, § 119-u, Village Law
§ 7-741, and Town Law § 284, the Village, Town, and the Village of
Woodsburgh agreed to coordinate regulation and entered into an
intermunicipal cooperation planning and land use regulation agreement (the
"intermunicipal cooperation agreement") with the purpose of undertaking
mutually beneficial, shared and coordinated comprehensive planning and land
use regulation for the Woodmere Club property in order to promote
intergovernmental cooperation, increase coordination and effectiveness of
comprehensive planning and land use regulation, make more efficient use of
infrastructure and municipal revenues and resources, as to enhance the
protection of community resources which span municipal boundaries.
(13) It is in that spirit, and pursuant to agreement of all three municipalities to work
together and the intermunicipal cooperation agreement, that the Village, in
conjunction and coordination with the adjacent contiguous Town and Village
of Woodsburgh, adopts and creates the Coastal Conservation District -
Woodmere Club (CC-WC), for the Village of Lawrence.
(14) The Coastal Conservation District- Woodmere Club (CC-WC) district
represents an intermunicipal plan that addresses current and future physical
climate risk changes due to sea level rise, storm surge and flooding. The
district recognizes these impacts in relation to the unique geographical setting
of the property at the Woodmere Channel terminus, its historical and
environmentally and ecologically sensitive setting, and the anticipated flood
impacts associated with this location. The risks to both private and public, and
existing and future, development from flooding in this location under current
and anticipated future conditions, necessitates multijurisdictional regulation
guided by preservation and protection. The CC-WC District incorporates
climate change considerations, while preserving both existing development
and infrastructure, as well as protecting future development, including
development on the Club property, from the virtual certainty of increasing
flood risks as time progresses.
(15) The Coastal Conservation District - Woodmere Club establishes three
subdistricts to ensure the preservation of existing open space and regulate
§ 212-13.1 ZONING § 212-13.1
212:15
development in a manner that is compatible with area zoning and development
patterns. The Open Space/Recreation Subdistrict and the Single-Family
Residential Subdistrict both include portions of the Village and the contiguous
Town of Hempstead and Village of Woodsburgh, while the Clubhouse/
Hospitality Subdistrict is located wholly within the Village of Woodsburgh.
The three subdistricts are described in Subsection J of this section.
(16) The Village of Lawrence Board of Trustees (hereinafter "Village Board") finds
that the creation of this zoning district, with its three subdistricts, is in harmony
with the coordinated creation of a similar zoning district in the contiguous
Town of Hempstead and Village of Woodsburgh, is in the public interest and
that the provisions of these coordinated contiguous complementary zoning
districts in each municipality are in the interest of the protection and promotion
of the public health, general welfare and safety of both the residents of the
Village and contiguous Town of Hempstead and Village of Woodsburgh.
(17) The creation of this district, in coordination with the contiguous
municipalities, is intended to preserve the Village's natural resources and
environmental features, while also preserving community character and the
economic value of other properties in the neighborhood in and about the
Woodmere Club property. Special consideration is provided for sustainable
design elements, which will help to mitigate flood impacts, preserve open
space, decrease stormwater runoff, improve local water quality, and reduce
traffic impacts. The regulations contained within this section have been
designed to be compatible and complementary with other permitted land uses
in the area and contiguous municipalities and protect the character of their
existing and developed residential communities.
C. Applicability. The intermunicipal Coastal Conservation District - Woodmere Club
(CC-WC) shall apply to the land that comprises the privately owned golf course
commonly known as "the Woodmere Club," and referred to herein as the
Woodmere Club property [Nassau County Land and Tax Map Section 41, Block F,
Lots 37, 40, 48, 310, 123/3024 (Lot Grouping), 3028, 3030A/3030B (Lot
Grouping), and 3032; Section 41, Block D, Lots 53 and 55; and Section 41, Block
72, Lot 1/3/4/5A/5B/6-9/11-12 (Lot Grouping)] (the "property"). Acreages
identified within this section are based upon the Nassau County Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) 2018 Tax Parcel database.

Grouping) on the Nassau County Land and Tax Map. The Zoning Map of the
Village of Lawrence is hereby amended accordingly, to reclassify the district
property as constituting the CC-WC District.
E. Definitions.
COMPENSATORY STORAGE  A standard which preserves the ability of the
floodplain to store water. Compensatory storage means that loss of flood storage
due to buildings or fill in the floodplain is compensated for by providing an equal
volume of storage to replace what is lost.
§ 212-13.1 LAWRENCE CODE § 212-13.1
212:16
LOT COVERAGE  The horizontal area of a lot covered by the roof areas of all
buildings and/or structures, in addition to all other impervious surfaces, including
but not limited to driveways, parking areas, patios, terraces, permeable pavement
and paver systems and other similar features.
PERMEABLE PAVEMENT SURFACES  Pervious hardscape surfaces that
allow for the infiltration of water into soils, helping to remove pollutants and
recharge the water table. Examples of permeable pavement surfaces include
pervious concrete, porous asphalt and permeable paving stones. Recycled concrete
aggregate (RCA) shall not be permitted as the base course material. Open graded
natural stone shall be used to facilitate stormwater permeability.
SMART CONTROLLER TECHNOLOGY  An irrigation control system that
reduces outdoor water use by monitoring and using information about site
conditions (including, but not limited to, soil moisture, rain, wind, slope, soil, plant

F. Master Plan submission.
(1) A conceptual development plan for the proposed development of the property
shall be filed simultaneously with the Town of Hempstead and the Villages of
Woodsburgh and Lawrence for review purposes prior to the filing of a map or
subdivision application with the Nassau County Planning Commission. The
purpose of this procedure is to facilitate a coordinated review with the Town
and Villages, including a conceptual subdivision layout for the three
subdistricts. The conceptual subdivision layout shall include existing and
conceptual proposed grading, proposed drainage for the lots and infrastructure,
lot configuration, hospitality development proposal, and plans for maintenance
of open space/common areas.
(2) Upon receipt of the conceptual development plan, the Town and Villages shall
review the plan for compliance with applicable zoning, subdivision and sitespecific
(including any performance standards and sustainable design)
regulations in effect in the respective jurisdictions. Each municipality shall
inform the applicant as to compliance with such regulations, within 45 days of
receipt of the conceptual development plan, and may also provide comments
regarding any relevant matter, including plans for maintenance of open space
and common area.
G. Subdivision map. No permit shall be issued for any building requiring a building
permit unless the site is shown on a subdivision map approved by the Nassau
County Planning Commission and any other jurisdiction with primary or concurrent
subdivision jurisdiction, and filed in the Nassau County Clerk's office.
H. Interpretation; conflicts with other provisions.
(1) In interpreting and applying the provisions of this section, the rules of
interpretation applicable to remedial legislation shall be used so that the spirit
and intent of this section shall be observed.

I. Severability. If Subsection J or K of this section shall be adjudged by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment shall invalidate the remainder
of this section. If any other provision shall be so adjudged, it shall not invalidate the
remainder of this section. If there is found to be any imprecision, including but not
limited to lot descriptions or acreage of total property, such will not invalidate this
ordinance.
J. Subdistricts established. The Coastal Conservation District - Woodmere Club
establishes three subdistricts to ensure the preservation of existing open space and
regulate development in a manner that's compatible with area zoning and
development patterns. The Open Space/Recreation Subdistrict and the Single-
Family Residential Subdistrict both include portions of the Town of Hempstead and
the contiguous Villages of Woodsburgh and Lawrence, while the Clubhouse/
Hospitality Subdistrict is located wholly within the Village of Woodsburgh. The
three subdistricts of the Coastal Conservation District - Woodmere Club are
provided in Figures 1 and 287 below and are described as follows:
(1) Open space/recreation subdistrict. Accounting for approximately 21.1 acres of
the approximately twenty-two-and-nine-tenths-acre Village of Lawrence
portion of the property (92% of the land area within the Village of Lawrence)
and approximately 83.3 acres of the approximately one-hundred-eighteen-andfour-
tenths-acre Woodmere Club (70% of total land area), the intent of the
Open Space/Recreation Subdistrict is to preserve critical coastal open space
areas to the maximum practicable extent. These open space areas provide
flood mitigation from storm surge, stormwater, and sea level rise, provide
critical habitats for wildlife and contribute significantly to the unique
community character of the area. In recognition of the flood mitigation
provided by these open space areas, and the protection of existing
development and infrastructure in the Town and the surrounding area, the use
of fill shall be regulated by the restrictions specified herein. Within the Open
Space/Recreational Subdistrict, grading for the purposes of floodwater
storage, including compensatory storage requirements of the Village of
Lawrence (Lawrence Village Code: Chapter 94, Flood Damage Prevention,
Article V Construction Standards, § 94-13, General standards) and the Village
of Woodsburgh (Woodsburgh Village Code: Chapter 77, Flood Damage
Prevention, Article V Construction Standards. § 77-15, General standards),
shall be permitted. In addition, within the Open Space/Recreational
Subdistrict, with the exception of areas associated for access, as defined in
§ 212-13.1T(3) of this section, any removal of trees greater than six-inch
caliper, or raising of grade by more than 12 inches, requires an administrative
approval by the Town Board pursuant to Town Code and the Building Zone
Ordinance.
(2) Single-family residential subdistrict. The Single-Family Residential
Subdistrict (approximately 29.4 acres of the approximately one-hundredeighteen-
and-four-tenths-acre Woodmere Club property, or 25% of total land
area) comprises two distinct development clusters, one in the Town of
Hempstead portion of the Woodmere Club property (approximately 19.3 acres
87. Editors Note: Said figures are included as attachments to this chapter.
§ 212-13.1 LAWRENCE CODE § 212-13.1
212:18
in size) and one straddling the boundaries of the Village of Woodsburgh
and the Village of Lawrence portions of the Woodmere Club property
(approximately 10.1 acres in size). These clusters, zoned for residential

to flashing and moving, and shall be positioned and designed in such a way
that they do not cast light off the subject premises or into a public right-of-way.
D. Failure to comply with this section shall be a violation of the Village Code
punishable by a fine not to exceed $250. Each week a violation persists shall
constitute a separate offense.

[Added 5-6-2021 by L.L. No. 5-2021]
§ 212-104. Purpose.
The Village Board has determined that there exists in the Village of Lawrence serious
conditions arising from non-owner-occupied dwelling units that are in violation of the
Village Code and the New York State Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code,
are inadequate in size, overcrowded and dangerous, tend to create parking problems, in
violation of peace and good order, and have negative effects on neighboring property
values. The Village Board finds that that the public safety, health, and well-being of
persons and property will be enhanced by enactment of the regulations set forth in this
article.

persons as a home or residence under an arrangement whereby the occupant or occupants
thereof pay rent for such occupancy and use.

or suspend any permit issued pursuant to this article after notice to the owner and a
reasonable opportunity for the owner to be heard. The Board of Trustees may take such
