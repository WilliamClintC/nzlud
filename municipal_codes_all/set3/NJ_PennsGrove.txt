A. Standard fees.

discovery. The fee assessed for discovery embodied in the form of
printed matter shall be $0.05 per letter size page or smaller, and

Chapter 36
DEFENSE AND INDEMNIFICATION
§ 36-1. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
DEFENSE  Refers to the means by which such public employee may
respond to any suit, allegation, or cause of action. The Borough of Penns
Grove shall provide the defense of any action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including a cross action,
counterclaim or cross complaint, against any public employee because of
any act or omission of that employee in the scope of his or her employment
and shall defray all costs of defending such action, including reasonable
counsel fees and expenses, together with costs of appeal, if any, excepting
actions, suits or proceedings brought by the Borough of Penns Grove
against any such employee. Expressly exempted from this chapter providing
defense and indemnification to public employees of the Borough of Penns
Grove are any charges, allegations, or actions of whatever nature asserted
by the Borough of Penns Grove against its own employees.
INDEMNIFICATION  To secure against loss or damage which may occur
in the future or to provide compensation for or to repair loss or damage
already suffered; to insure; to save harmless.
PUBLIC EMPLOYEE  Includes any employee of the Borough of Penns
Grove and shall include any elected or appointed official, counsel or special
counsel, or any officer, employee or servant, whether or not compensated,
who is authorized to perform any act or service for the Borough of Penns
Grove. The term "public employee" shall also include persons formerly
holding office or employment, provided the events giving rise to a cause
of action or claim hereunder conform to the requirement herein
established.[Amended 7-5-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-5]
§ 36-2. Findings.
The Mayor and Council for the Borough of Penns Grove find as follows:
A. The State of New Jersey, through the passage of the Tort Claims Act, as
amended and supplemented from time to time (N.J.S.A. 59:1-1 et seq.),
has determined the circumstances under which claims may be made
against public entities and their officials, employees and servants.
B. Said Tort Claims Act also specifies under what circumstances a public
entity may defend and indemnify its officials, employees and servants.
C. The Mayor and Council for the Borough of Penns Grove hereby provide,
under certain circumstances, for the defense and indemnification of its
officers, employees and servants in the good faith performance of their
duties and responsibilities.
§ 25-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 36-2
1:27
§ 36-3. Indemnification.
§ 36-4. Limit of obligation.
By common law and this express provision to this chapter, the Borough of
Penns Grove's authority to indemnify is limited to acts by public employees
D. Such defense and indemnification are especially appropriate for
members of appointed boards who serve the Borough of Penns Grove
without monetary compensation.
E. The indemnification of municipal employees is also expressly designed
to avoid a conflict between the employer and the employee when claims
are lodged. The Supreme Court for the State of New Jersey has noted
that because the law does not require, but does permit, indemnification
of local public entity employees, conflicts of interest may arise in the
absence of such indemnification where an entity and an employee are
both sued for compensatory damages in, for example, a civil rights
action and both employ the same attorney to defend. Likewise, the
court pointed out such conflict could arise because the employee is
liable for punitive damages and the entity is not. (See Petition for
Review of Opinion 552, 102 N.J. 194.) Accordingly, this indemnification
policy is also intended to increase the efficiency and reduce the costs of
defending the Borough of Penns Grove and its employees and agents in
the event of such actions.
A. Whenever a civil action shall be brought against any person holding an
office, position or employment with the Borough of Penns Grove for any
action or omission arising out of or in the course of the performance of
the duties of such office, position or employment, the Borough of Penns
Grove shall indemnify and provide payment of any damage award not
otherwise covered by any policy of insurance of the Borough of Penns
Grove. Note, however, that the Borough of Penns Grove does not, by
indemnifying its employees against damages, indirectly or directly
waive any immunity against any claims.
B. Whenever a civil action shall be brought against any person holding an
office, position or employment with the Borough of Penns Grove for any
action or omission arising out of or in the course of the performance of
the duties of such office, position or employment, the Borough of Penns
Grove shall provide payment of that portion of any costs of defense of
said action not covered by the Borough's policy of insurance. Whenever
any insurance policy whose purpose is to provide the defense and
indemnification of the Borough of Penns Grove or its public employees
is in dispute, the Borough of Penns Grove will stand in the place of the
insurance carrier, subject to all rights of subrogation, to provide for the
defense and indemnification of its employees as specified herein. Said
public employee has an affirmative duty, to be eligible for said defense
and indemnification, to cooperate with the Borough of Penns Grove in
any and all of its efforts to resolve any disputed insurance coverage.
§ 36-2 PENNS GROVE CODE § 36-4
1:28
that are within the scope of their employment and which are not criminal,
fraudulent, malicious or instances of willful misconduct. Additionally, the
Borough of Penns Grove will not provide the means for defense nor
indemnify any public employee in those instances where the Borough of
Penns Grove has initiated the charges or action. In the event any such
public employee is charged with criminal charges and he or she is later
acquitted, any application to recover the cost of his or her defense is
expressly conditioned upon the ultimate determination of administrative
charges which may or may not arise out of the same conduct or behavior.
Notwithstanding all of the above, in the event the Borough of Penns Grove
elects to assert such administrative charges and even if the employee
should thereafter prevail, all such claims for reimbursement for costs of
defense will be subjected to the controlling statutory and common law as
opposed to this chapter. (Note: The "..., or may not, ..." clause addresses
those instances wherein an officer is suspended on unrelated charges, but
the proceeding is tolled by a parallel criminal action.)

A. No Borough official or employee or member of his/her immediate family

acceptance of contributions to the campaign of an announced candidate

with the intent to influence the Borough official in the discharge of his/
her official duties;
F. No Borough official or employee shall use, or allow to be used, his
public office or employment, or any information, not generally available
to the members of the public, which he receives or acquires in the
course of and by reason of his office or employment, for the purpose of
securing financial gain for himself, any member of his immediate family,
or any business organization with which he is associated;
G. No Borough official or employee or business organization in which he/
she has an interest shall represent any person or party other than the
Borough in connection with any cause, proceeding, application or other
matter pending before any agency in the Borough in which he/she
serves. This provision shall not be deemed to prohibit one Borough
employee from representing another Borough employee where the
Borough agency is the employer and the representation is within the
context of official labor union or similar representational
responsibilities;
H. No Borough official shall be deemed in conflict with these provisions if,
by reason of his participation in the enactment of any ordinance,
resolution or other matter required to be voted upon or which is subject
to executive approval or veto, no material or monetary gain accrues to
him/her as a member of any business, profession, occupation or group,
to any greater extent than any gain could reasonably be expected to
accrue to any other member of such business, profession, occupation or
group;
I. No elected Borough official shall be prohibited from making an inquiry
for information on behalf of a constituent, if no fee, reward or other
thing of value is promised to, given to or accepted by the official or a

return therefor; and

themselves, in negotiations or proceedings concerning his/her, or their,

by the Borough official or a member of his/her immediate family during
the preceding calendar year. Individual client fees, customer receipts or
commissions on transactions received through a business organization

traded security is the source of income, the security need not be
reported unless the Borough official or member of his/her immediate
family has an interest in the business organization;

General Provisions
[Adopted 2-1-2000 by Ord. No. 2000-219; amended in its entirety
9-15-2009 by Ord. No. 2009-13 (Ch. 50, Art. I, of the 1986 Code)]
§ 116-1. Establishment, mission and purpose.
§ 116-2. Composition; line of authority; jurisdiction.
A. There is hereby established a Police Department in the Borough of
Penns Grove, County of Salem and State of New Jersey, pursuant to the
provisions of N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118 et seq. This article is intended to ratify
the existence and operation of the Police Department which has
historically operated within and served the Borough of Penns Grove and
at the same time satisfy the statutory requirements of the legislation
amended in 1981 and 1988 respectively.
B. The mission and purpose of this Police Department are generally
threefold: to preserve life and property; to provide a general police
service for the residents of the Borough of Penns Grove, Salem County,
State of New Jersey; to enforce federal, state, county and municipal
laws, statutes and ordinances; and as hereinafter may be more
expressly defined.
A. Said Police Department will be governed by one Appropriate Authority
and shall consist of one Chief of Police. In addition, the Police
Department shall consist of no more than one lieutenant, four
sergeants, two detectives, four corporals, four patrolmen, three special
patrolmen and other civilian employees as deemed necessary and
appropriate by the Appropriate Authority in his/her discretion and
judgment, with the approval of the governing body. The Appropriate
Authority and/or the governing body may, from time to time, leave one
or more of the above positions vacant as he/she or it sees fit. The
express purpose for naming these offices is to establish a statutory line
of authority from all police employees to higher elected authority as
required by law and to provide the organizational framework for future
growth and/or attrition or reduction in force as may become applicable.
Whenever any such office, including the office of Chief of Police, is
intentionally left vacant, it will be deemed not to exist and will be
bypassed in the chain of command (e.g., if the governing body chose to
no longer have sergeants of police, then all civilian employees,
patrolmen and detectives would answer directly to a lieutenant or the
next higher rank in lieu thereof). The Appropriate Authority, with the
approval of the governing body, may thereafter recreate or resurrect an
office that has been so abolished by naming a person to fill said office.
No person may be appointed to the Penns Grove Borough Police
Department until he or she has satisfied all statutory requirements and

6-15-1971, as amended.
§ 116-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 116-2

has complied with the selection process and standards established
by the rules and regulations adopted by the Appropriate Authority
to govern the Police Department. [Amended 6-8-2011 by Ord. No.
2011-7; 10-18-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-11; 7-5-2017 by Ord. No.
2017-5]
B. Jurisdiction.
(1) Appropriate authority. Said Police Department shall come under
the jurisdiction of the Appropriate Authority, which position is
hereby created pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118. Said Appropriate
Authority shall be the Mayor. The Appropriate Authority shall be
responsible directly to the governing body. The Chief of Police shall
be directly responsible to the Appropriate Authority for the day-today
operation of the Police Department pursuant to policies
established by said Appropriate Authority. The Appropriate
Authority is hereby vested with the duty of and shall be responsible
for the promulgation, adoption, updating, and/or ratification of
rules and regulations for police personnel which shall be known as
the "Rules and Regulations for the Police Department of the
Borough of Penns Grove" (N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118). In the absence of
the appointment of a full-time professional Director of Public Safety
and/or a Police Director, the Chairman of the Police Committee or
his/her designee shall have the title of Police Director. [Amended
2-7-2012 by Ord. No. 2012-1]
(2) Hearing authority. [Amended 6-8-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-7]
(a) In the event a collective bargaining agreement is not
controlling and disciplinary proceedings are brought against
any member of the Police Department of the Borough of Penns
Grove below the rank of Chief of Police, the Police Committee
or its designee shall be the sole hearing authority in charge of
all such proceedings. The decision of the hearing authority
shall be final and binding. The right of appeal shall be to the
New Jersey Superior Court pursuant to law. [Amended
7-5-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-5]
(b) In the event of any disciplinary proceedings against the Chief
of Police of the Borough of Penns Grove, the Police Committee
of the Borough of Penns Grove shall be designated as the
hearing authority and in charge of all such proceedings. The
decision of said hearing authority shall be final and binding.
The right of appeal shall be to the New Jersey Superior Court
pursuant to law.
(c) In the event a designated hearing authority is utilized pursuant
to Subsection B(2)(a) above and the designated hearing
authority is to be an officer within the Penns Grove Borough
Police Department (e.g., Chief of Police), only a person of
§ 116-2 PENNS GROVE CODE § 116-2
1:78
greater rank than the person charged may be so designated for
that purpose.
(3) Charging authority.
(a) In the event a Penns Grove Borough Police Department officer
is to be charged in a disciplinary action and said employee is
subordinate to the rank of the Chief of Police, only the Chief of
Police or his designee may initiate such charges (N.J.S.A.
40A:14-118). In the event the office of the Chief of Police has
been abolished through intentional vacancy, then the
Appropriate Authority or his/her designee shall function as the
charging authority. Failure to initiate charges when the same
are indicated may constitute a neglect or dereliction of duty
[Gauntt v. Bridgeton, 194 N.J. Super. 468, 477 A.2d 381 (App.
Div. 1984)], but the function of the charging authority may not
be circumvented. [Amended 6-8-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-7;
7-5-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-5]
(b) In the event the Chief of Police for the Borough of Penns Grove
is to be charged in a disciplinary action, the Appropriate
Authority shall be the charging authority. The Appropriate
Authority is hereby empowered to name a designated special
counsel to function as an alternative charging authority
without prior Council approval in an emergency. This is
necessitated by the statutory time lines involved in the
charging process. Notwithstanding this authority, at the
earliest opportunity the Appropriate Authority shall inform
Council of the action that he has taken and obtain its approval.
[Amended 6-8-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-7]
(c) Any person(s), whether police officer, special counsel, or the
Appropriate Authority, who serves in an investigative capacity
and/or as the charging authority relevant to a Penns Grove
Borough Police Department disciplinary action may not
thereafter be designated as or serve as the hearing authority in
that same disciplinary action. [Amended 7-5-2017 by Ord.
No. 2017-5]
(4) Appeals. [Amended 6-8-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-7]
(a) Any employee seeking to appeal disciplinary charges shall do
so in writing submitted to the office of the Chief of Police. Said
appeal shall be filed within five days, not including Saturdays,
Sundays and holidays, of the date said charges were served
upon said employee. When charges are filed against the Chief
of Police, he shall, within five days, not including Saturdays,
Sundays and holidays, file said appeal with the Police
Committee of the Borough of Penns Grove. In the event an
appeal is filed by any employee, the hearing authority shall
schedule a hearing in accordance with the provisions of this
§ 116-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 116-2
1:79
article and state statute. A preliminary notice of disciplinary
action served on any employee shall contain the date, time and
location for a prospective hearing as required by statute. That
hearing date may be postponed at the discretion of the hearing
authority within the statutory time lines. Any postponement
beyond the statutory thirty-day time line would generally
require a waiver of the thirty-day rule by the employee and a
formal request for said postponement. However, all employees
are put on notice that a failure to submit the required written
request for an appeal would constitute an act of
insubordination and may affect the employee's rights
pertaining to said statutory time lines, the discovery
proceedings, as well as other legal rights and remedies
appurtenant thereto.
(b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in
this article, the grievance procedure respecting disciplinary
charges, and any appeals thereof, against any member of the
Police Department shall follow that established in any
collective bargaining agreement between the Borough of
Penns Grove and any employee of the Police Department
covered under such collective bargaining agreement.
C. Special law enforcement officers. The Appropriate Authority shall, with
the approval and consent of the Borough Council, appoint special law
enforcement officers as he/she or it may deem necessary. They shall be
a part of the Police Department established herein and subject to all the
laws, rules and regulations governing the same. Pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40A:14-146.8 et seq., the term of said appointment shall be at the
discretion of the governing body. The personnel referred to in this
subsection shall be compensated at such hourly rate as designated in

It is hereby declared to be the public policy of this Borough to recognize
the public's general right to know pursuant to the Open Public Records Act
(N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 et seq.). All records kept in the course of official duties
by any Borough officer or employee shall be deemed to be "government
records," as that term is defined by N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1, and such records
shall be subject to inspection by the public unless exempt under the statute
or other regulation, common law practice, executive order of the Governor,
rules of court, federal law or judicial decision.
§ 132-2. Custodian of records.
In accordance with N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1.1, the Municipal Clerk is designated as

as specific as possible, including the type of record and date created, if
known.
B. The Municipal Clerk shall promptly comply with a request to inspect,
examine, copy or provide a copy of a government record. If the Clerk is
unable to comply with a request for access, he or she shall inform the
requestor of the specific basis for such inability to comply.
C. In those instances where the nature of the request or the record itself
leads the Municipal Clerk to doubt whether or not the record is a
"government record" as defined by law or is a record exempt from
disclosure, the Clerk shall request an opinion from the Municipal
Attorney. A copy of the request shall be forwarded to the Attorney, who,
after review and investigation, shall issue an opinion and note such
opinion on the request and promptly return it to the Municipal Clerk.
D. If any part of a particular record is exempt from public access pursuant
to N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 et seq., the Clerk shall delete, redact or excise from a

arrangements to make a copy of the record available.

deny a request for access to a record as soon as possible, but not later than
seven business days after receiving the request, provided that the record
is currently available and not in storage or archived. In the event that the
Clerk fails to respond within seven business days after receiving a request,
the failure to respond shall be deemed a denial of the request, unless the
requestor has elected not to provide a name, address or telephone number,
or other means of contacting the requestor. If the requestor has elected
not to provide a name, address, or telephone number, or other means of
contacting the requestor, the Clerk shall not be required to respond until
the requestor reappears before the custodian seeking a response to the
original request. If the government record is in storage or archived, the
requestor shall be so advised within seven business days after the Clerk
receives the request. The requestor shall be advised by the Clerk when the
record can be made available. If the record is not made available by that
time, access shall be deemed denied.
§ 132-5. Posting of appeals procedure.
The Clerk shall post prominently in public view, in or adjacent to the Clerk's
office, a statement that sets forth in clear, concise and specific terms the
right to appeal a denial of or failure to provide access to a government
record and the procedure by which an appeal may be filed.
§ 132-6. Viewing of government records; removal prohibited.
F. If a request for access to a government record would substantially

accommodates the interests of the requestor and the municipality.
G. As required by N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5e, immediate access shall be granted for
access to budgets, bills, vouchers, contracts (including collective
negotiations agreements and individual employment contracts), and
public salary and overtime information.
A. Upon the approval of a request to view, inspect, examine or copy a
record, the record and the requestor shall remain in the presence of the
Municipal Clerk or his or her authorized representative at all times.
Under no circumstances shall any government record be removed from
the office where it is normally kept unless accompanied by the
custodian or his or her authorized representative.
B. In the event that the nature of a request to view records requires that
the Clerk or other municipal employee observe or monitor such viewing
for a period of time exceeding one hour, the requestor shall be
responsible for reimbursing the municipality for time spent by the Clerk
or other employee.

of duplicating the record, where the nature, format, manner of collation
or volume of printed matter is such that it cannot be reproduced by
ordinary document-copying equipment in ordinary business size or
where such record involves an extraordinary expenditure of time and
effort to accommodate the request. The fee shall be assessed on a caseby-
case basis using the standards and criteria established by the
Government Records Council as may be amended from time to time.
The requestor shall have the opportunity to review and object to the
special service charge prior to it being incurred.

§ 173-13. Purpose.
This article is enacted for the purpose of prohibiting the possession and
consumption of alcoholic beverages in public parks, playgrounds, recreation
areas, and private conveyances on public areas and public ways and,
further, prohibiting the consumption and possession of alcoholic beverages
on private property without the express written permission of the owner.
§ 173-14. Consumption restricted.

with the intent to consume any alcoholic beverages in or upon any public

§ 173-15. Private conveyances.
No person shall consume or offer to another for consumption or possess
with the intent to consume any alcoholic beverage in any private
conveyance while such conveyance is located in or on any public street,

§ 173-20. Violations and penalties. [Amended 6-17-1986 by Ord. No.
86-5; 7-5-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-5]

A. For the purposes of this article, a person shall be deemed to be in
possession of an alcoholic beverage within the meaning of this article if
he intends to or does exercise custody, control or dominion over such
alcoholic beverage; provided, however, that actual physical or manual
possession is not required if the intention to exercise such custody,
control or dominion over the alcoholic beverage is manifested from the

Underage Consumption
[Adopted 7-5-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-6]
§ 173-22. Legislative authority.
Senate No. 692 was duly passed by both houses of the New Jersey
Legislature and signed into law by the Governor on June 26, 2000, to
become effective immediately (P.L. 2000, c. 33). This legislation amends
N.J.S.A. 40:48-1.2 to provide a new section authorizing a municipality to
enact an ordinance making it unlawful for any person under the legal age
to, without legal authority, knowingly possess or knowingly consume an
alcoholic beverage on private property and providing for the assessment of
penalties, including the suspension, revocation or postponement of certain
driving privileges. The Borough of Penns Grove is of the opinion that such
an ordinance is in the public interest and will promote public safety and will
contribute to the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community
at large.
§ 173-23. Underage consumption prohibited.
It shall be unlawful for any person under the legal age to, without legal
authority, knowingly possess or knowingly consume an alcoholic beverage
on private property.
§ 173-24. Violations and penalties.
A. Any person violating the provisions of this article shall, in accordance
with the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:48-1.2, as amended, be punished by a
fine of $250 for a first offense and $350 for any subsequent offense.
B. In addition to the fine authorized for this offense, the court may
suspend or postpone for six months the driving privilege of the
defendant. Upon the conviction of any person and the suspension or
postponement of that person's driver's license, the court shall forward a
report to the Division of Motor Vehicles stating the first and last day of
the suspension or postponement period imposed by the court pursuant
to N.J.S.A. 40:48-1.2, as amended. If a person at the time of the
imposition of sentence is less than 17 years of age, the period of license
postponement, including a suspension or postponement of the privilege
of operating a motorized bicycle, shall commence on the day the
sentence is imposed and shall run for a period of six months after the
person reaches the age of 17 years.
C. If a person at the time of the imposition of a sentence has a valid
driver's license issued by this state, the court shall immediately collect
the license and forward it to the Division of Motor Vehicles along with
the report. If for any reason the license cannot be collected, the court
shall include in the report the complete name, address, date of birth,
§ 173-22 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 173-24
1:111
§ 173-25. Exceptions.
eye color, and sex of the person, as well as the first and last date of the
license suspension period imposed by the court.
D. The court shall inform the person orally and in writing that if the person
is convicted of operating a motor vehicle during the period of license
suspension or postponement, the person shall be subject to the
penalties set forth in N.J.S.A. 39:3-40. A person shall be required to
acknowledge receipt of the written notice in writing. Failure to receive
a written notice or failure to acknowledge in writing the receipt of a
written notice shall not be a defense to a subsequent charge of a
violation of N.J.S.A. 39:3-40.
E. If a person convicted under this article is not a New Jersey resident, the
court shall suspend or postpone, as appropriate, the nonresidential
driving privilege of the person based on the age of the person and
submit it to the Division of Motor Vehicles on the required report. The
court shall not collect the license of a nonresident convicted under this
article. Upon receipt of a report for the court, the Division of Motor
Vehicles shall notify the appropriate officials in the licensing
jurisdiction of the suspension or postponement.
A. Nothing contained in this article is intended, nor shall it be construed,
as prohibiting an underage person from consuming or possessing an
alcoholic beverage in connection with a religious observance, ceremony
or rite or consuming or possessing an alcoholic beverage in the
presence of and with the permission of a parent, guardian or relative
who has attained the legal age to purchase and consume alcoholic
beverages.
B. As used in the preceding Subsection A, the following terms shall have
the meaning set forth:
GUARDIAN  A person who has qualified as a guardian of the underage
person pursuant to testamentary or court appointment.
RELATIVE  The underage person's grandparent, aunt or uncle, sibling
or any other person related by blood or affinity.
C. Nothing contained in this article is intended nor shall it be construed as
prohibiting possession of alcoholic beverages by any such person while
actually engaged in the performance of employment by a person who is
licensed under Title 33 of the Revised Statutes, or while actively
engaged in the preparation of food while enrolled in a culinary arts or
hotel management program at a county vocational school or postsecondary

shall be confined in the enclosure or, if taken out of the enclosure,
securely muzzled and restrained with a tether approved by the
Animal Control Officer and having a minimum tensile strength
sufficiently in excess of that required to restrict the potentially
dangerous dog's movements to a radius of no more than three feet

GENERAL REFERENCES
Subdivision of land  See Ch. 400.
§ 203-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Borough of Penns
Grove 911 Locatable Mailing Address System."
§ 203-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide for a uniform Borough-wide system
for assigning street numbers to all principal buildings in the Borough to
assist fire and rescue companies, law enforcement agencies and other
organizations in the timely and efficient provision of their services to the
residents and businesses of the Borough.
§ 203-3. Administration.
A. The 911 Coordinator, appointed annually, is hereby designated as the
agent responsible for the administration, implementation and
enforcement of this chapter.
B. The agent shall establish street address numbers in accordance with
guidelines established herein as follows:
(1) Street addresses shall be assigned by the agent to each lot on new
final subdivision plats at the time of recordation. The agent shall
then notify the respective developer of these addresses.
(2) The agent shall undertake a systematic renumbering program for
streets within the Borough in accordance with the policies and
guidelines established herein. In the interim, as building permit
applications are filed for development on parcels along streets
which have not yet been systematically renumbered, the agent
shall determine and assign an appropriate street address number
for such development prior to approval of such building permit.
C. As street address numbers are determined and assigned by the agent as
provided above, such number shall be recorded on an Official 911 Map
to be maintained by the agent and kept available for reference in the
office of the 911 Coordinator and in the office of the Clerk. No building
permit shall be approved until a street address has been determined
and assigned from the map.
§ 198-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-3
1:149
§ 203-4. Determination of street address numbers.
Street address numbers shall be determined in accordance with the
following:
D. Property owners or current occupants shall be notified of their street
address numbers as assigned by the systematic renumbering program.
The agent shall notify residents in writing of the change to their address
due to the renumbering. The property owner shall be responsible for
telephoning the Bell Atlantic New Jersey business office to report his
new address in order to incorporate this information into the 911
system.
E. Within 60 days after the receipt of written notification of change or
assignment of address, the owner or occupant shall affix/display the
assigned number as prescribed herein.
F. It shall be the duty of such owner or occupant, upon affixing the new
number, to remove any different address number. The initial set of new
numbers shall be supplied by the Borough. The cost of additional or
replacement numbers shall be the responsibility of the property owner.
A. One correct name shall be used for each street in the Borough, and
where two separate and noncontiguous streets within the Borough have
the exact same name, a distinctive prefix or suffix shall be assigned to
distinguish the streets or a new name shall be assigned to one street. If
two existing streets have names that have resulted in confusion due to
any similarity and a name change is not practical, the property
numbering on the streets shall be made to contrast significantly as an
added safety measure. Numbering by the mile post system may be used
as an alternative, if possible. [Amended 7-5-2017 by Ord. No.
2017-5]
B. Each property with frontage on or access to any street shall be assigned
an official property number, except where one or more buildings or lots
are located on an unnamed private road, lane or way having access to a
street. In that situation, only one official number shall be assigned,
followed by a letter beginning with "A" and continuing alphabetically.
C. Official property numbers shall proceed from a logical point of origin
and shall be in proper numerical sequence in relation to the numbers
assigned to other lots with frontage on or access to the same street.
D. Odd numbers shall be assigned to properties situated on the northerly
and easterly sides of the street and even numbers assigned to
properties on the southerly and westerly sides of the street. There shall
be sufficient flexibility so that the numbering system may accommodate
maximum density as allowed by zoning regulations now in effect. If
existing lot frontage is less than the minimum zoned frontage, the
numbering shall compress to accommodate the existing lot frontage.
§ 203-3 PENNS GROVE CODE § 203-4
1:150
E. Only those properties which have a principal structure shall be
assigned a street address. Numbers shall be reserved for vacant parcels
a minimum of every 18 feet, with the exception of less than the
minimum zoned frontage as described in Subsection D. In plotted
subdivisions, consecutive street numbers shall be assigned to
consecutive lots rather than prescribed intervals. Additional numbers
shall be reserved for oversized lots within subdivisions based on zoning
district frontage requirements to accommodate potential future
divisions.
F. If a county route is comprised of two or more streets that have separate
names, then the name assigned by the Borough shall be used in the
addressing, the 911 database and on the 911 Map and street signs.
Where applicable, the county route number shall also be listed in the
911 data bank. [Amended 7-5-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-5]
G. Signs.
(1) On every major access road that enters the Borough, signs shall be
erected stating "entering Borough of Penns Grove." If the street
name changes or the property numbering is not in sequence on any
street that crosses a municipal boundary, the street name shall stay
the same and the property numbering shall remain in sequence.
The sign shall face traffic as it enters the Borough of Penns Grove.
[Amended 7-5-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-5]
(2) All municipal, county and state roads within the Borough shall have
a street sign as in accordance with the Official Map of the Borough
of Penns Grove.
H. Any new street shall have a unique name which shall be registered in
the office of the 911 Coordinator for entry into the database prior to the
issuance of a construction permit.
I. If a large lot has more than one available property number and it
contains a building, then the property number that best describes the
location of the driveway or access point shall be assigned.
J. In multifamily, commercial, industrial and similar development
situations where density of development may render the abovedescribed
addressing intervals ineffective, a building or building group
may be assigned a single number, and a numerical or alphabetical suffix
may be assigned to each dwelling unit, business or establishment
within such building or building group.
K. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to require the
renumbering of existing streets merely because the existing even and
odd numbers are transposed, nor shall it be required that streets within
existing subdivisions be renumbered unless a substantial problem with
existing addresses has been identified by the agent.
§ 203-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 203-4
1:151
§ 203-5. Size and location of street address numbers.
L. Where major roads enter the Borough from another jurisdiction, street
address numbers shall be assigned as a continuation of the numbering
series used in that jurisdiction.
M. The Borough shall, after implementation and adoption of the 911
locatable mailing address system, forward a correct version of the
Official Municipal Tax Map and House Numbering Map, where
available, to each United States post office serving the Borough and to
all emergency services. The Borough shall take any steps which it
deems necessary to inform the residents and businesses of the changes
in their addresses. The residents or businesses are responsible for
making the address corrections at their delivering postal facility and all
other notifications. [Amended 7-5-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-5]
N. The legal name of the Borough shall appear on the bottom line of all
mailing addresses within the Borough, and the name of the postal
facility shall not be used unless it is exactly the same as the municipal
name. The existing five-digit zip code that presently delivers the mail
shall be incorporated into the address and remain unchanged.
[Amended 7-5-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-5]
O. Mailing address.
(1) The standard three-line 911 locatable mailing address shall appear
as follows when mail is delivered in to the location:
Resident or Business Name
333 Street Name Apt., Suite, etc.
Municipal Name, NJ Zip Code
(2) The standard three-line 911 locatable mailing address shall appear
as follows for a location when the occupant receives mail delivered
to a post office box within a postal facility:
Resident or Business Name
333 Street Name, Municipal Name
P.O. Box 333
Post Office Name, NJ Zip Code
P. In applying the guidelines specified herein, the agent shall have the
authority to make minor adjustments and modifications to ensure a
logical and efficient street address system.
A. Street address numbers for residences shall not be less than five inches
in height and shall be of a durable and clearly visible material. The
numbers shall be conspicuously placed above or at the side of the main

Vacant Property Registration
[Adopted 3-3-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-2]
§ 206-15. Definitions.
For purposes of this article, the following terms are defined as set forth
herein:
MUNICIPAL OFFICER  The Housing Officer or such official as may be
designated by the Mayor and Council.[Amended 7-5-2017 by Ord. No.
2017-5]
OWNER  Includes any private title holder, any agent of a private title
holder having authority to act with respect to a vacant property, any
foreclosing entity that has filed a notice with the Municipal Clerk pursuant
to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 46:10B-51 (P.L. 2008, c. 127, Sec. 17, as
amended by P.L. 2009, c. 296), or any other entity determined by the
Municipal Officer of the Borough of Penns Grove to have authority to act
with respect to the property. This article exempts any municipal, county or
state owner of a vacant building or structure.
VACANT PROPERTY  Any building or structure which is not at present
legally occupied or at which all lawful business or construction operations
or residential or other occupancy has substantially ceased, and which is
in such condition that it cannot legally be reoccupied without repair or
rehabilitation, including but not limited to any property meeting the criteria
for abandoned property in N.J.S.A. 55:19-81; provided, however, that any
habitable property where all building systems are in sound working order,
where the building and grounds are maintained in good condition, and
which is being actively marketed by its owners for sale or rental shall not be
deemed a vacant property for purposes of this article.[Amended 7-5-2017
by Ord. No. 2017-5]
§ 206-16. Registration required.
A. Effective on April 1, 2015, the owner of any vacant property as defined
herein shall, within 30 days after the building becomes vacant property
or within 30 days after assuming ownership of the vacant property,
whichever is later, or within 10 days of receipt of notice by the
municipality, file a registration statement for such vacant property with
the Municipal Officer on forms provided for that purpose by the
Municipal Officer along with any fee required by this article. Failure to
receive notice by the municipality shall not constitute grounds for
failing to register the property.
B. Each property having a separate tax block and lot number shall be
registered separately.
C. The registration shall include the information required under this
section, the insurance certificate required by § 206-20 of this article, as
§ 206-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 206-16
1:161
well as any additional information that the Municipal Officer may
reasonably require.
D. The registration shall remain valid for one year from the date of
registration. The owner shall be required to renew the registration
annually as long as the building or structure remains a vacant property
and shall pay a registration or renewal fee in the amount prescribed in
§ 206-18 for each vacant property registered.
E. The Municipal Officer may establish for purposes of efficient
administration that all registrations shall be renewed by a single date in
each year, which date shall be established by the Municipal Officer, in
which case the initial registration fee shall be prorated for registration
statements received less than 10 months prior to that date.
F. Any owner of vacant property who submits plans to the Municipal
Officer that completely rehabilitate or restore the property to
productive use and occupancy within the twelve-month period following
the date of the initial property registration shall be exempt from
payment of the registration fee if the Municipal Officer deems the
rehabilitation or restoration project may be complete in that twelvemonth
period but shall comply with all other provisions of this article. In
the event that the property has not been restored to productive use and
occupancy at the end of the twelve-month period, the owner shall be
liable for any fee waived. The Municipal Officer may extend the waiver
of the registration fee for not more than one additional year in response
to a written request by the owner where the Municipal Officer finds that
compelling conditions outside the owner's control made it impossible
for the owner to restore the property within the initial twelve-month
period.
G. Where the owner is an entity experienced in rehabilitation or
redevelopment of vacant properties, and where the property subject to
this article is being held for a project of rehabilitation or redevelopment
consistent with municipal plans and ordinances, and where by virtue of
financing, marketing or other conditions that project may require more
than one year for realization, the Municipal Officer may extend the
waiver of the registration fee on an annual basis without limitation upon
written request by the owner as long as the Municipal Officer finds that
the owner is making reasonable progress toward completion of the
project. The owner shall provide the Municipal Officer with such
documentation, which may include plans, financing applications,
applications for land use approval or other evidence of progress.
H. The owner shall notify the Municipal Officer within 30 days of any
change in the registration information by filing an amended registration
statement on a form provided by the Municipal Officer for such
purpose.
I. The registration statement shall be deemed prima facie proof of the
statements therein contained in any administrative enforcement

1:173
A. It is understood that the map approved and adopted pursuant to § 236-1
of this chapter was prepared and is intended to be used as evidence in
prosecutions arising under the criminal laws of this state and that
pursuant to state law such map shall constitute prima facie evidence of
the following:

municipality;
(2) The boundaries of the real property which is owned by or leased to
such schools or a school board;
(3) That such school property is and continues to be used for school
purposes; and
(4) The location and boundaries of areas which are on or within 1,000
feet of school property.
B. All of the property depicted on the map approved and adopted herein as
school property was owned by (or leased to) a school or school board

approved herein to depict the location and boundaries of any property
which is, in fact, used for school purposes and which is owned by or
leased to any elementary or secondary school or school board, whether
the absence of such depiction is the result of inadvertent omission or
the result of any changes in the location and boundaries of such
property which have not yet been incorporated into a revised approved
map, shall not be deemed to be an official finding and record that such
property is not owned by or leased to a school or school board, or that
such property is not used for school purposes.
D. All of the requirements set forth in L. 1988, c. 44, concerning the

Subdivision of land  See Ch. 400.
Zoning  See Ch. 450.
§ 252-1. Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and
objectives.
A. Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has
in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et seq. delegated the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote public
health, safety, and general welfare of their citizenry.
B. Findings of fact.
(1) The flood hazard areas of the Borough of Penns Grove are subject
to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(2) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood
heights and velocities and, when inadequately anchored, cause
damage in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed,
elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute
to the flood loss.
C. Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed to:
(1) Protect human life and health;
(2) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control
projects;
(3) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general
public;
(4) Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
§ 247-8 PENNS GROVE CODE § 252-1
1:180
§ 252-2. Definitions.
(5) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
(6) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize
future flood blight areas;
(7) Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area
of special flood hazard; and
(8) Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
D. Methods of reducing flood losses. In order to accomplish its purposes,
this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
(1) Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards or which
result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or
velocities;
(2) Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;
(3) Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or
channel floodwaters;
(4) Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development
which may increase flood damage; and
(5) Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood
hazards in other areas.
A. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
B. As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AH ZONE  Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance
shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Base flood elevations (BFEs) derived from
detailed hydraulic analyses are shown in this zone.
AO ZONE  Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance
shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average
depths are between one and three feet.

interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a
variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO or AH Zone on
a community's Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) with a onepercent
annual or greater chance of flooding to an average depth of
one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where
the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be
evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  Land in the floodplain within
a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in
any given year. It is shown on the FIRM as Zone V, VE, V1-30, A, AO,
A1-A30, AE, A99, or AH.
BASE FLOOD  A flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled
or exceeded in any given year.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE)  The flood elevation shown on a
published Flood Insurance Study (FIS) including the Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM). For Zones AE, AH, AO, and A1-30 the elevation
represents the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has
a one-percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year. For Zones VE and V1-30 the elevation represents the
stillwater elevation (SWEL) plus wave effect (BFE = SWEL + wave
effect) resulting from a flood that has a one-percent or greater chance
of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
BREAKAWAY WALL  A wall that is not part of the structural support
of the building and is intended through its design and construction to
collapse under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage
to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system.
COASTAL A ZONE  The portion of the special flood hazard area
(SFHA) starting from a Velocity (V) Zone and extending up to the
landward limit of the moderate wave action delineation. Where no V
Zone is mapped, the Coastal A Zone is the portion between the open
coast and the landward limit of the moderate wave action delineation.
Coastal A Zones may be subject to wave effects, velocity flows, erosion,
scour, or a combination of these forces. Construction and development
in Coastal A Zones is to be regulated the same as V Zones/coastal highhazard
areas.
COASTAL HIGH-HAZARD AREA  An area of special flood hazard
extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune
along an open coast and any other area subject to high-velocity wave
action from storms or seismic sources.
DEVELOPMENT  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved
real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures,
§ 252-2 PENNS GROVE CODE § 252-2
1:182
mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling
operations, or storage of equipment or materials located within the
area of special flood hazard.
DIGITAL FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (DFIRM)  The official map
on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the
areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to
the community.
ELEVATED BUILDING  A non-basement building built, in the case of
a building in an area of special flood hazard, to have the top of the
elevated floor or, in the case of a building in a coastal high-hazard
area or Coastal A Zone, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal
structural member of the elevated floor elevated above the base flood
elevation plus freeboard by means of piling, columns (posts and piers),
or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water and adequately anchored
so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a
flood up to the magnitude of the base flood. In an area of special flood
hazard, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means
of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In areas of coastal
high hazard and Coastal A Zones, "elevated building" also includes a
building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building" even
though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls.
EROSION  The process of the gradual wearing away of land masses.
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION  A
manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are
to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the
construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of
concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain
management regulations adopted by a community.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM)  The official map on which
the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas
of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the
community.

1:183
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS  Zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special
purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance
and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power.
The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination
thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage
prevention and reduction.
FLOODPROOFING  Any combination of structural and nonstructural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or
eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water
and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.
FREEBOARD  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends
to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to
flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood
and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the
hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed.
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE  The highest natural elevation of the
ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed or existing
walls of a structure.

1:184
LOWEST FLOOR  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable
solely for the parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an
area other than a basement is not considered a building's lowest floor
provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure
in violation of other applicable non-elevation design requirements of 44
CFR 60.3.
MANUFACTURED HOME  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use

SUBDIVISION  A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into
two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
NEW CONSTRUCTION  Structures for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain regulation
adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to
such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION  A
manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are
to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the

of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the
floodplain management regulations adopted by the municipality.
PRIMARY FRONTAL DUNE  A continuous or nearly continuous
mound or ridge of sand with relatively steep seaward and landward
slopes immediately landward and adjacent to the beach and subject
to erosion and overtopping from high tides and waves from coastal
storms. The inland limit of the primary frontal dune occurs at the point
where there is a distinct change from the relatively steep slope to a
relatively mild slope.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE  A vehicle which is built on a single
chassis, 400 square feet or less when measured at the longest
horizontal projections, designed to be self-propelled or permanently
towable by a light-duty truck, and designed primarily not for use as a
permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational,
camping, travel, or seasonal use.
SAND DUNES  Naturally occurring or man-made accumulations of
sand in ridges or mounds landward of the beach.
START OF CONSTRUCTION  For other than new construction or

improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond
the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation,
such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation
of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings or piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary
forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory
buildings, such as garages or sheds, not occupied as dwelling units
or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the
actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE  A walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, or
a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE  Damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its condition
before damage would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals
or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of

F. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
(1) The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by
man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land
outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within
such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages.
(2) This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Borough of
Penns Grove, any officer or employee thereof or the Federal
Insurance Administration for any flood damages that result from
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.
A. Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be
obtained before construction or development begins, including
placement of manufactured homes, within any area of special flood
hazard established in § 252-3B. Application for a development permit
shall be made on forms furnished by the Borough Engineer and may
include, but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing
the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question;
existing or proposed structures; fill; storage of materials; drainage
facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following
information is required:
(1) Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor (including
basement) of all structures;
(2) Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure has
been floodproofed;
(3) Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect that
the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet
the floodproofing criteria in § 252-5B(2); and
(4) Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development.
B. Designation of the local administrator. The Borough Engineer is hereby
appointed to administer and implement this chapter by granting or
denying development permit applications in accordance with its
provisions.
C. Duties and responsibilities of the administrator. Duties of the Borough
Engineer shall include but not be limited to:
(1) Permit review. The Borough Engineer shall:
§ 252-3 PENNS GROVE CODE § 252-4
1:188
(a) Review all development permits to determine that the permit
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
(b) Review all development permits to determine that all
necessary permits have been obtained from those federal,
state or local governmental agencies from which prior
approval is required.
(c) Review all development permits in the coastal high-hazard and
Coastal A Zone area of the area of special flood hazard to
determine if the proposed development alters sand dunes so as
to increase potential flood damage.
(d) Review plans for walls to be used to enclose space below the
base flood level in accordance with § 252-5C(2)(d).
(2) Use of other base flood data. When base flood elevation data has
not been provided in accordance with § 252-3B, Basis for
establishing the areas of special flood hazard, the Borough
Engineer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation data available from a federal, state or other source in
order to administer § 252-5B(1), Specific standards, residential
construction, and § 252-5B(2), Specific standards, nonresidential
construction.
(3) Information to be obtained and maintained.
(a) The Borough Engineer shall obtain and record the actual
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all new or substantially improved
structures and whether or not the structure contains a
basement.
(b) For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures
the Borough Engineer shall:
[1] Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean
sea level); and
[2] Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in
Subsection A(3).
(c) In coastal high-hazard and Coastal A Zone areas, certification
shall be obtained from a registered professional engineer or
architect that the provisions of § 252-5C(2)(a) and (b)[1] and
[2] are met.

§ 252-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 252-4
1:191
§ 252-5. Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing
items in Subsection D(1)(d)[1] to [11] have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre,
the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
(b) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a historic structure and the variance
is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character
and design of the structure.
(c) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood
hazard, to afford relief.
(d) Variances shall only be issued upon:
[1] A showing of good and sufficient cause;
[2] A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
[3] A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as
identified in Subsection D(1)(d), or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
(e) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built
with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and
that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the
increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.

B. Should the owner or retailer of the impounded shopping cart fail to
retrieve the shopping cart upon notification, upon conviction of
violation of this chapter, the Municipal Court shall impose a fine not
exceeding $50 for each occurrence for failure to retrieve shopping
carts. An occurrence includes all shopping carts impounded in
accordance with this section during a twenty-four-hour period.
C. The Borough shall allow the owner or retailer a minimum of five
business days following receipt of notice that a shopping cart has been
impounded to retrieve the shopping cart before a violation is issued and
before the cart is sold or otherwise disposed of.
A. The Borough may impound a shopping cart without compliance with
§ 371-5 under the following circumstances:
§ 371-4 PENNS GROVE CODE § 371-6
1:266
§ 371-7. Notice of public auction; redemption fee and costs; sale.
When any shopping cart remains in the possession of the Borough for a
period set forth in § 371-5 above after removal and with respect to which no
person has retrieved said cart from the Borough with proof establishing to
the Borough's satisfaction that the person retrieving the cart has sufficient
proof of ownership or right of possession, then the Borough shall give public
notice in its official newspaper that, at a specified place and time, not less
than five days after such notice is published, such shopping cart shall be
sold at public auction for not less than $25, plus the cost of advertising the
sale. If, after such notice of sale is given, any person desires to redeem any
cart prior to sale, such person shall pay to the Borough for redemption the
sum of $25 plus the cost of advertising the sale. A general description of the
cart shall be sufficient. The sale shall be conducted by the Borough Clerk
or such person as the governing body may designate. The redemption costs
shall not be exclusive of any penalty or fine issued as a result of a violation
of this chapter.
(1) The Borough may impound a shopping cart that has a sign or notice
identifying the owner of the shopping cart, or the retailer who has
written consent from the owner to use the cart, and lists a valid
telephone number or address through which the owner or retailer
can be contacted, without meeting the conditions required by
§ 371-5 of this chapter if the Borough follows the following

ARTICLE III
Design Standards
[Amended 7-5-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-5]
§ 375-6. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to provide design standards for improvements
that are proposed or required as part of site plan, subdivision, variance, and
other applications for development made pursuant to this chapter. These
standards will apply to all matters that are not subject to the requirements
of the New Jersey Residential Site Improvement Standards.
§ 375-7. New Jersey Residential Site Improvement Standards.
Residential and nonresidential subdivision, site plan and variance
applications are subject to the New Jersey Residential Site Improvement
Standards (RSIS), codified at N.J.A.C. 5:21-1.1 et seq. Applicants who wish
to deviate from the RSIS must apply for exceptions or waivers pursuant
to RSIS requirements. If recommended by the Planning Board Engineer,
the Planning Board may apply the RSIS design specifications and other
requirements to commercial or industrial major subdivision, site plan,
variance, or other applications for development of nonresidential projects.
§ 375-8. Review criteria.
Subject to the requirements of the Residential Site Improvement Standards,
and applying generally accepted design standards and principles, the
following factors in § 375-9 et seq. of this article shall be considered in the
review and development of all subdivision, site plan, variance, and other
applications for development.
§ 375-9. Site design.
The design and layout of structures and improvements shall be reviewed
so as to provide aesthetically pleasing design, efficient arrangement, and
proper function. In the orientation and placement of structures and
improvements, the unique characteristics of the site shall be taken into
account, with consideration given to relating structures and improvements
to the natural terrain and other site features, creating desirable focal
points, preserving natural views, and respecting the established character
of the neighborhood and areas reserved for public use. The development
plan shall provide for a unified design with features that tie principal
and accessory structures together and relate site features successfully
and harmoniously to similar elements and surrounding buildings, using
generally accepted design standards and principles in conformance with the
requirements of this chapter and the Borough Master Plan.
§ 375-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 375-10
1:277
§ 375-10. Circulation.
Proposed pedestrian and vehicular traffic movement within and adjacent to
the site shall be reviewed, applying generally accepted design standards
and principles, with particular emphasis on the provision and layout of
properly designed parking areas, off-street loading and unloading areas,
and the movement of people, goods and vehicles within and near the site.
The Planning Board shall ensure that all parking spaces and driveways
are usable and safely and conveniently arranged. Access to the site from
adjacent roads shall be designed so as to interfere as little as possible with
traffic flow on these roads and to permit vehicles a rapid and safe entrance
and exit to and from the site. Streets and driveways in a subdivision or other
development must be of sufficient width and suitable grade and suitably
located to accommodate prospective traffic and to provide access for firefighting
and emergency equipment to buildings. New streets meeting all
requirements of this chapter and other applicable laws must be coordinated
with the Official Map, if any, and the circulation element of the Master
Plan, if any, and oriented so as to permit, consistent with the reasonable
utilization of land, the buildings constructed thereon to maximize solar
gain. Streets wider than 50 feet will not be required unless the street is
an extension of an existing street at the greater width, or already has
been shown on the Master Plan at the greater width, or already has been
shown in greater width on the Official Map. The site also must conform
to applicable state and county and municipal highway/road/street access
management codes. Upon recommendation of its Engineer, the Planning
Board may require a traffic study for any application for development.
§ 375-11. Parking and loading area design standards.
Any new or changed use, structure, or other development which is the
subject of an application pursuant to this chapter must meet the following
off-street parking and loading requirements:
A. Parking spaces must be a minimum of nine feet wide and 18 feet long.
B. Parking areas must be no less than 50 feet from driveway intersection
with public road or street.
C. No parking spaces are allowed in a driveway, unless it is wide enough to
prevent vehicles from backing into the travel lane.
D. Curbing and guttering is required to ensure adequate drainage,
delineate the borders of the parking area and separate parking spaces
from driveways and aisles.
E. Off-street parking for more than two vehicles must be designed so no
vehicles will back into the street.
F. Aisles within parking areas must meet the following minimum width
requirements:
(1) Parallel parking: 12 feet.

G. Parking spaces, driveways, and aisles must be clearly marked. Areas
must be designated for fire-fighting and emergency equipment and
must be clearly marked as such.
H. One-way internal circulation system is required in all parking areas
having 20 or more parking spaces.
I. Parking areas may not be located within side or rear yard setback areas
or within 10 feet of any street.
J. At least 5% of the parking area must be landscaped along walkways,
center islands and at the end of bays, in addition to the general
landscaping requirement per site plan, subdivision or other
development approval.

number of spaces provided equals or exceeds the combined total of all
of the spaces that are required for each use or structure. See also
Chapter 450, Zoning, § 450-62E.
O. Off-street parking must be on lot or contiguous to the lot and adjacent
to the principal uses. For nonresidential uses in commercial districts,
parking may be up to 300 feet away, measured from the nearest point of
the parking facility to the nearest point of the principal building. See
also Chapter 450, Zoning, § 450-62G.
P. New off-street loading must not affect existing off-street loading in a
way that would make it deficient for the uses served. Surface must be
asphaltic or portland cement concrete. Off-street loading spaces must
be designed so that no vehicles will back into public streets or internal
access roads or a parking area. Loading areas must be located or
screened so they cannot be seen from adjacent land uses or from the

§ 375-11 PENNS GROVE CODE § 375-12
1:280
§ 375-12. Drainage.
The drainage system should be adequate to convey the stormwater and
natural drainage water which originates not only within the developed lot's
boundaries but also that which originates from the total natural watershed
surrounding the property in question.
A. The drainage system shall be designed to control the amount and rate
of stormwater runoff. A general principle for development design shall
be to not increase the parcel's rate of stormwater runoff by the use of
structural and nonstructural measures.
B. Whenever possible, any development's drainage system shall be
designed for the recharge of groundwater and the retention of
stormwater on site.
C. Provisions shall be made to limit the amount of sedimentation and other
pollutants that may enter a natural watercourse as a result of the
development.
D. Where possible, a development's stormwater management design shall
preserve stream channels, floodplains, and wetlands in their natural
condition to act as buffers against flooding and pollution.
E. No stormwater runoff or natural drainage water shall be so diverted as
to overload existing drainage systems, create flooding, or require the
construction of additional drainage facilities in other private or public
lands without proper and approved provisions being made for
remedying these off-site or off-tract conditions.
F. For all developments, land subject to periodic or occasional flooding
(floodplain areas) shall not be plotted for residential occupancy nor for
any other purpose which may endanger life or property or aggravate
the flood hazard. Such land within a plat shall be considered for open
land use.
G. All streets shall be provided with catch basins and pipes where
necessary for proper surface drainage. Dry wells are specifically
prohibited as alternatives to catch basins, or as a method of recharge.
H. The materials used for drainage facilities and appurtenances shall be in
conformance with N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.4, as the same may be revised from
time to time, particularly with low points in the streets and no overland
relief. Otherwise, such materials shall be in conformance with the
Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction of the New
Jersey Department of Transportation, and all addenda. The technique
for calculations and design parameters shall be by the rational method
for drainage sheds less than four acres and the Natural Resources
Conservation Service method for drainage sheds above four acres.
I. For storm sewer design, a ten-year to twenty-five-year storm frequency
consistent with localized circumstances should be considered as a
§ 375-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 375-12
1:281
minimum, unless special circumstances are involved such as
inadequate downstream stormwater facilities, lack of positive overland
relief, or evidence of local flooding. In such special circumstances,
engineers shall design facilities to accommodate, as a minimum, the
following storm frequencies:
(1) Ten-year storm drain systems where excess flow can continue
downgrade in the street or parking lot and not exceed the gutter
capacity. Also, ten-year storms shall be used at low points in storm
drain systems with overland relief.
(2) Twenty-five-year storm where flow in a storm drain is totally
carried by pipe when conditions above do not apply.
(3) Twenty-five-year storm for culvert design where the culvert will be
located in streams shown as a blue line on the New Jersey State
Atlas or the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey maps.
Culverts with an upstream drainage area of 50 acres or more shall
be designed to accommodate a one-hundred-year frequency storm
in accordance with flood hazard area control regulations, N.J.A.C.
7:13.
(4) Twenty-five-year storms for open channels where the upstream
drainage area is less than 50 acres. When the upstream drainage
area is 50 acres or more, design engineers shall design open
channels to accommodate the one-hundred-year storm in
accordance with flood hazard area control regulations, N.J.A.C.
7:13.
J. Storm drain inlets installed as part of new development and
redevelopment projects (public or private) that disturb one acre or
more are subject to the requirements of this subsection. In addition,
retrofitting of existing storm drain inlets to this standard is required
where such inlets are in direct contact with repaving, repairing,
reconstruction or alterations of facilities owned or operated by the
Borough. For exemptions to this standard see Subsection J(3),
Exemptions, below.
(1) Grates in pavement or other ground surfaces.
(a) Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a storm
drain or surface water body under that grate:
[1] The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT)
bicycle-safe grate, which is described in Chapter 2.4 of the
NJDOT Bicycle Compatible Roadways and Bikeways
Planning and Design Guidelines (April 1996).
[2] A different grate, if each individual clear space in that
grate has an area of no more than seven square inches or
§ 375-12 PENNS GROVE CODE § 375-12
1:282
is no greater than 0.5 inch across the smallest dimension.
(In regard to whether the different grate must also be
bicycle safe, the Residential Site Improvement Standards
include requirements for bicycle-safe grates.)
(b) Examples of grates subject to this standard include grates in
grate inlets, the grate portion (non-curb-opening portion) of
combination inlets, grates on storm sewer manholes, ditch
grates, trench grates, and grates of spacer bars in slotted
drains. Examples of ground surfaces include surfaces of roads
(including bridges), driveways, parking areas, bikeways,
plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields, open channels, and
stormwater basin floors.
(2) Curb opening inlets (including curb opening inlets in combination
inlets).
(a) Whenever design engineers use a curb opening inlet, the curb
opening shall be divided (except as provided below) by bars or
other means into individual clear spaces. Each such clear
space shall have an area of no more than seven square inches
or be no greater than two inches across the smallest
dimension.

as to minimize glare and reflection on adjacent properties. Streetlighting
shall be provided in accordance with the recommendations of the Planning
Board Engineer and as required by the Borough Planning Board. Adequate
lighting shall be provided at all intersections and along all roads classified
as Borough collectors. The developer shall pay to the Borough the costs
of operation of said streetlights (as determined by the standard rates of
the utility) until the street upon which said streetlights are installed is
accepted by the Borough Council as a public street. All subdivision, site
plan, variance, and other applications for development must include plans
for proposed exterior lighting, including location, type, pole height, and
luminaire mounting height (all must be depicted in plan detail), radius of
light and intensity in footcandles, and designed in accordance with the
following and other generally accepted standards:
underdrains in addition to storm sewer conduit for the purpose of
adequately underdraining the surrounding soil and stabilizing the
affected subbase.
(5) Slotted drainpipe shall not be permitted, unless approved by the
Municipal Engineer.
R. Any area occupied or to be occupied by a municipal watercourse,
surface or subsurface drainageway, channel or stream must be
established by easement to the Borough. The width of the drainage
easement shall be determined by the Borough Engineer based upon the
width needed to accommodate future stormwater runoff and to allow
sufficient area for maintenance or construction activities. A minimum
width of all drainage easements shall be 40 feet or 20 feet from the
edge of the watercourse.
S. For minimum stormwater management requirements and controls for
major development in the Borough of Penns Grove please see Chapter
387, Stormwater Management.
A. The style, light standard, and height of the light must be consistent with
the architectural style of the principal building. Light height cannot
exceed 35 feet. Lights must be shielded to restrict maximum
illumination apex to 150° and to prevent glare to adjacent land uses.

requirements. Landscaping shall include trees, bushes, shrubs, ground
cover, perennials, annuals and plants and shall be designed according
to generally accepted standards. A landscaping plan must be submitted
with each development application. The landscaping plan must identify
and locate existing and proposed trees, shrubs, bushes, plants and ground
cover. It also must indicate proposed alterations to the terrain. Additionally,
the following principles should be followed:
A. Landscaping must accent and complement buildings and promote
interior climate control.
B. The impact over time of proposed landscaping shall be considered so
that shrubs or trees do not grow to block sight distances, especially at
driveway entrances and in parking areas.
C. Factors to consider include species, texture, color, and shape as well as
resistance to disease, litter, and maintenance requirements.
D. The preservation of existing trees and vegetation is encouraged. Trees
greater than 15 inches in diameter shall be incorporated into the

has been designed according to the approved cross sections.
§ 375-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 375-15
1:289
§ 375-16. Signs.
§ 375-17. Utilities; solid waste disposal.
Sanitary waste disposal, water supply and solid waste disposal shall be
reviewed to confirm conformity with public safety regulations. Stormwater
drainage and detention facilities, stormwater management plans, and all
applicable laws and regulations shall be reviewed and considered,
particularly with respect to land designated as subject to flooding, to avoid
danger to life or property. Particular emphasis shall be given to the
adequacy of all existing utility systems and the need for any on-site or offsite
improvements. Adequate fire protection systems must be included in
all plans. Solid waste disposal must be adequate to minimize infestation by
vermin and rodents and must conform to all applicable Borough recycling
ordinances and other applicable laws and regulations, including but not
limited to § 382-7E of the Borough Code.
(4) To prevent problems with underground utilities and impacts to the
sidewalks, shade trees must be placed five feet to 10 feet behind
sidewalk. Street trees shall be planted 40 feet to 60 feet apart,
parallel to the curb and directly outside any utility easements
which border the project's right-of-way. A ten-foot-wide shade tree
easement shall be created if required by the Board. Trees shall not
be placed in the grass strip between the curb and sidewalk.
(5) Trees shall be balled and burlapped, nursery grown, free from
insects and disease and true to species and variety.
A. To facilitate the safe and efficient movement of traffic into and out of a
land development, the Borough Planning Board may, as a condition of
the land development approval, require the installation of specified
directional, regulatory or advisory signs or pavement markings at
designated locations on the land development on the Borough right-ofway.
Such signs shall be of a size, color and design as specified in the
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways,
as amended and supplemented by the New Jersey Department of
Transportation.
B. No advertising sign, device or marking may be designed to be erected
on or overhang a Borough right-of-way. Advertising signs which revolve,
move, flash, or give the illusion of movement shall be prohibited within
25 feet of the existing or proposed future curbline.
A. Plans must include depictions of all public services being connected to
an approved public utility system. Development applicants must submit
written approval from each serving utility to confirm compliance with
this section.

installation of the utilities, distribution supply lines, and service
connection. Service connections shall be made underground for all
§ 375-15 PENNS GROVE CODE § 375-17
1:290
§ 375-18. Environmental considerations.
Environmental elements relating to soil erosion, preservation of trees, and
protection of watercourses, topography, soil, and wildlife shall be reviewed
and the design of the plan shall minimize any adverse impact on these
elements. Whenever possible, the natural features of a site are to be
preserved, floodplains respected, and excessive cut or fill avoided. In
reviewing a development application, the Planning Board shall take into
consideration the effect of the development upon all aspects of the
environment as outlined in the environmental impact statement
requirements, as well as the sufficiency of the applicant's proposal in the
environmental impact statement for dealing with any immediate or
projected adverse effects. The reviewing authority may require, as a
condition of approval or the application, that steps be taken to minimize
all adverse environmental impacts during and after construction, and no
final approval shall be issued until all such requirements shall have been
complied with or compliance is guaranteed by a performance guarantee.
§ 375-19. Natural features.
The important natural features of a site shall be preserved in the design of
all development projects in accordance with generally accepted standards.
Natural features that shall be protected include the natural terrain,
wetlands, wooded area, vistas, natural drainageways, and lakes. A
developer shall only be permitted to significantly alter or encroach on
the existing natural features if the Planning Board is convinced that the
alteration is the minimum necessary to allow the use of the land for the
intended purpose and that there are no alternatives to the development
project design which would eliminate or mitigate any adverse impact on
natural features.
§ 375-20. Topsoil protection.
No topsoil shall be removed from the site or used as spoil. Topsoil moved
during the course of construction shall be redistributed within the
development project so as to provide at least four inches of cover to all
areas of the development project and shall be stabilized by seeding or
planting.
§ 375-21. Lot configuration.
developments. Whenever the widening or extension of a street requires
the replacement or relocation of utilities, such replacement or
relocation shall be underground. Common trenches shall be utilized
where appropriate according to generally accepted standards.
C. Utility easements along rear or side property lines may be required.
Such easements shall be at least 20 feet wide and, to the extent
possible, be centered on or adjacent to rear or side lot lines.
§ 375-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 375-21
1:291
§ 375-22. Monuments.
Monuments shall be installed in compliance with the requirements of the
Map Filing Law (N.J.S.A. 46:26B-1 et seq.). All lot corners shall be marked
with a durable metal alloy pin.
§ 375-23. Improvements to be within municipal boundaries.
No cul-de-sac or loop street, or any part thereof, or any building or site
improvements for any site plan or subdivision project may extend from
Penns Grove into another municipality, or from another municipality into
Penns Grove. All streets and portions thereof, including cul-de-sac streets,
loop streets, and portions of all other types of streets within Penns Grove,
must provide access only to lots that meet all applicable lot area, dimension
and configuration requirements.
§ 375-24. Private storm drain inlet retrofitting.
See Chapter 390, Stormwater Pollution Control, Article VII, Private Storm
Drain Inlet Retrofitting.
§ 375-25. Dumpster enclosures.
Dumpsters must be surrounded by a masonry wall or vinyl fence which
shall be at least six feet high and which structure shall have a self-closing
gate for access (side or rear access door or doors optional). The enclosure
shall be situated on a paved surface, and if it is constructed with chain-link
fencing it shall have vinyl slatting to obscure the interior from passersby. In
A. Lot dimensions and area shall not be less than the requirements of
Chapter 450, Zoning, of the Borough Code unless approved by variance.
B. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight
streets and radial to curved streets.
C. Where additional right-of-way has been required to bring existing
rights-of-way up to standard, lots shall begin at the proposed right-orway
line and all setbacks shall be measured from that line.
D. For proper development of the land within the Borough, lots shall have
an average length no greater than 250% of the average width, except
where the width exceeds three times the zoning requirements.
E. Where there is a question as to the suitability of a lot or lots for their
intended use due any failure to meet the above lot configuration
standards, or due to factors such as poor drainage conditions or where
percolation tests or test borings show the ground conditions to be
inadequate for proper on-lot sewage treatment, the Planning Board
may, after adequate investigation, withhold approval of such lots. If
approval is withheld, the Planning Board shall specify the reasons for
such denial in its memorializing resolution.
§ 375-21 PENNS GROVE CODE § 375-25
1:292
addition, steel bollards shall be placed in the interior of the enclosure, the
exact location of which shall be determined by the Planning Board Engineer.

For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
ASBESTOS-CONTAINING WASTE  All materials manufactured from
asbestos, including but not limited to asbestos insulation, asbestos shingles,
A. The Borough of Penns Grove finds that it is in the public interest to
require the separation of designated waste materials from trash,
garbage and other waste products which are collected by the Borough
and are disposed of in a solid waste landfill facility. Obvious
environmental and cost benefits will be derived from practicing waste
minimization, and its importance as part of a comprehensive solid
waste management plan cannot be overestimated. Hence, the Borough
encourages all residents, along with commercial and institutional solid
waste generators, to reduce waste at the source, to reuse materials
when practical and to recycle waste when possible.
B. The Borough also recognizes its obligation to establish a mandatory
recycling program under the provisions of P.L. 1987, c. 102, as
amended.34 In order to fulfill its obligations under state statute, to
conserve recyclable materials for sale and reuse to the public benefit
and to reduce the amount of solid waste to be disposed of in a sanitary
landfill and thus to reduce the cost of disposal fees incurred by the
Borough and its residents, the within chapter is hereby adopted and
amended to comply with the provisions of the County Solid Waste
Management Plan.

A. Policy statement. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant
reduction through nonstructural stormwater management strategies
per this chapter, and all low-impact stormwater management
strategies, shall be explored before relying on structural BMPs.
Structural BMPs should be integrated with nonstructural stormwater
management strategies and proper maintenance plans. Nonstructural
strategies include both environmentally sensitive site design and
source controls that prevent pollutants from being placed on the site or
from being exposed to stormwater. Source control plans should be
developed based upon physical site conditions and the origin, nature,
and the anticipated quantity or amount of potential pollutants. Multiple
stormwater management BMPs may be necessary to achieve the
established performance standards for water quality, quantity, and
groundwater recharge.
B. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for major
development, as defined in § 387-2.
C. Applicability. This chapter shall be applicable to all site plans,
subdivisions, variance, conditional use, and general development plans
for the following major developments that require preliminary or final
site plan or subdivision review:
(1) Nonresidential major developments; and
(2) Aspects of residential major developments that are not preempted
by the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21 et
seq.
D. Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements.
Compliance with the requirements of this chapter is to be considered an
integral part of development approvals under the review process for
applicable major developments and does not relieve the applicant of the
responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for activities
regulated by any other applicable code, rule, act, or ordinance. In their
interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be
held to be the minimum stormwater management requirements for the
promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare. This
chapter is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other
ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law, except
that, where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different
from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other
provision of law, the more restrictive provisions or higher standards
shall control.
E. Residential development subject to Residential Site Improvement
Standards. All residential development shall remain subject to
applicable requirements of the Residential Site Improvement Standards
at N.J.A.C. 5:21 et seq.

existing conditions are maintained to the maximum extent
practicable; and
(3) The construction of a public pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk
or trail with a maximum width of 14 feet, provided that the access
is made of permeable material.
D. The Planning Board may grant a waiver from strict compliance with the
groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater
runoff quality requirements of Subsections F and G below for the
enlargement of an existing public roadway or railroad, or the
construction or enlargement of a public pedestrian access, provided
that all of the following conditions are met: [Amended 7-5-2017 by
Ord. No. 2017-5]
(1) The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the
project that cannot be accomplished by any other means;

through the use of nonstructural and structural stormwater
management strategies and measures, the option selected
complies with the requirements of Subsections F and G to the
maximum extent practicable;
(3) The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the requirements
of Subsections F and G, existing structures currently in use, such

(4) The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other
rights to areas, including the potential to obtain through
condemnation lands not falling under Subsection D(3) above,
within the upstream drainage area of the receiving stream that
would provide additional opportunities to mitigate the
requirements of Subsections F and G that were not achievable on
site.
E. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in Subsections F
and G shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
§ 387-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 387-4
1:317
management strategies set forth in this subsection into the design.
The applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures
incorporated into the design of the project. If the applicant
contends that it is not feasible for engineering, environmental,
or safety reasons to incorporate any nonstructural stormwater
management measures identified in Subsection E(2) below into
the design of a particular project, the applicant shall identify the
strategy considered and provide a basis for the contention.

For exemptions to this standard see Subsection E(3)(c) below.
(a) Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a storm
drain or surface water body under that grate:
[1] The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT)
bicycle-safe grate, as described in the NJDOT Bicycle
Compatible Roadways and Bikeways Planning and Design
Guidelines, as amended; or
[2] A different grate, if each individual clear space in that
grate has an area of no more than seven square inches, or
is no greater than 0.5 inch across the smallest dimension.
Examples of grates subject to this standard include grates
in grate inlets, the grate portion (non-curb-opening
portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm sewer
manholes, ditch grates, trench grates, and grates of spacer
bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground surfaces
include surfaces of roads (including bridges), driveways,
parking areas, bikeways, plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields,
open channels, and stormwater basin floors.
(b) Whenever design engineers use a curb opening inlet, the clear
space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if
the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an
area of no more than seven square inches or be no greater than
two inches across the smallest dimension.
(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the Planning Board determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in Subsection G(1) are conveyed through any
device (e.g., end of pipe netting facility, manufactured
treatment device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed,
§ 387-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 387-4
1:319
at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
[a] A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches
wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inch;
[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars, to
the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified
in Subsection G(1); or
[4] Where the NJDEP determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register listed historic property.
(4) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in Subsections F and
G below shall be dedicated to a government agency other than the
Borough of Penns Grove, subjected to a conservation restriction
filed with the Salem County Clerk's office, or subject to an
approved equivalent restriction that ensures that measure or an
equivalent stormwater management measure approved by the
Planning Board is maintained in perpetuity.
(5) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 387-7 or found on the Department's website
at www.njstormwater.org.
F. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at § 387-5, either:
§ 387-4 PENNS GROVE CODE § 387-4
1:320
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain 100% of the average annual preconstruction
groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from pre-construction to post-construction for the
two-year storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects with any urban redevelopment areas or to
projects that are subject to Subsection F(1)(b)[3] below.
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or
applied; areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than "reportable
quantities" as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4, or any subsequent amendments thereto; areas
where recharge would be inconsistent with a NJDEP
approved remedial action work plan or landfill closure
plan; and areas with high risks for spills of toxic
materials, such as gas stations and vehicle
maintenance facilities; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
"Source material" means any material(s) or machinery
located at an industrial facility that is directly or
indirectly related to process, manufacturing or other
industrial activities, which could be a source of
pollutants in any industrial stormwater discharge to
groundwater. Source materials include, but are not
limited to, raw materials; intermediate products; final
products; waste materials; by-products; industrial
machinery and fuels; and lubricants, solvents, and
detergents that are related to process, manufacturing,
or other industrial activities that are exposed to
stormwater.
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
§ 387-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 387-4
1:321
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
downgradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the methods and procedures for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 387-5, complete one of the
following to the Board's satisfaction:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, post-construction
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten- and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
pre-construction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events.
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the preconstruction
condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten- and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
and projected land uses assuming full development under
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage
area.
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
post-construction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten-, and
one-hundred-year storm events are 50%, 75% and 80%,
respectively, of the pre-construction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the post-construction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
site on which the proposed development or project is to be
constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to postconstruction
stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge.
[4] In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with Subsection F(1)(c)[1], [2] and
[3] above shall only be applied if the increased volume of
stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the
point of discharge.
(2) A minimum of two soil borings shall be required for each basin. For
each basin with surface area of 1/2 acre or more, borings will be
§ 387-4 PENNS GROVE CODE § 387-4
1:322
required at a rate of one soil boring per each 1/2 acre in addition
to the initial two borings per facility.
(3) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of "major development" for purposes of this chapter shall
be submitted to the appropriate Soil Conservation District for
review and approval in accordance with the requirements of this
section, any applicable Soil Conservation District guidelines for
stormwater runoff quantity and erosion control, and the Rutgers
Farmland Management Best Management Practices. For the
purposes of this section, "agricultural development" means land
uses normally associated with the production of food, fiber and
livestock for sale. Such uses do not include the development of land
for the processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of
agriculturally related products.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
post-construction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in
stormwater runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the
developed site, expressed as an annual average. Stormwater
management measures shall only be required for water quality
control if an additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being
proposed on a development site. The requirement to reduce TSS
does not apply to any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated
under a numeric effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New
Jersey Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules,
N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in a discharge specifically exempt under a
NJPDES permit from this requirement. The water quality design
storm is 1.25 inches of rainfall in two hours. Water quality
calculations shall take into account the distribution of rain from the
water quality design storm, as reflected in Table 1 of the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual Chapter 5,
as amended. The calculation of the volume of runoff may take into
account the implementation of nonstructural and structural
stormwater management measures.
(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 4-1 in Chapter 4
of the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual,
as amended, presents the presumed removal rates for certain
BMPs designed in accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater
Best Management Practices Manual. The BMP Manual and other
sources of technical guidance are listed in § 384-7 or found on the
Department's website at www.njstormwater.org. Total suspended
solids reduction shall be calculated based on the removal rates for
the BMPs in the aforementioned Table 4-1 as amended. Alternative
removal rates and methods of calculating removal rates may be
used if the design engineer provides documentation demonstrating
the capability of these alternative rates and methods to the review
agency. The applicant must provide a copy of any approved
§ 387-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 387-4
1:323
alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate to the
NJDEP at the following address prior to signature of plans or any
clearing, grading, demolition, installation of improvements or other
construction-related activities at the site: Division of Watershed
Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, P.O. Box 418, Trenton, New Jersey 08625-0418.
(3) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
80% TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize the
following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A + B - (A x B)/100
Where:
R = Total TSS percent load removal from application of
both BMPs.
A = The TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first
BMP.
B = The TSS percent removal rate applicable to the
second BMP.
(4) If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the 80% TSS
removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the runoff
from the subareas converges on site, in which case the removal
rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a weighted
average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed
according to standards set forth in Subsections B and C above to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the post-construction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in Subsections F and G
above.
(6) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, as
amended.
(7) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,

quadrangle maps or in the county soil surveys, within the
§ 387-4 PENNS GROVE CODE § 387-4
1:324
associated HUC14 drainage area. These areas shall be established
for the protection of water quality, aesthetic value, exceptional
ecological significance, exceptional recreational significance,
exceptional water supply significance, and exceptional fisheries
significance of those established Category One waters. These areas
shall be designated and protected as follows:
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A three-hundred-foot special water resource protection
area shall be provided by means of conservation
easements and conservation restrictions in favor of the
Borough on each side of the waterway, measured
perpendicular to the waterway from the top of the bank
outwards or from the center line of the waterway where
the bank is not defined, to preserve existing vegetation
and/or to promote the natural succession of new
vegetation.
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under Subsection G(8)(a)[1]
above shall only be allowed where previous development
or disturbance has occurred (for example, active
agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn area).
The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable. In no case shall the remaining special water
resource protection area be reduced to less than 150 feet
as measured perpendicular to the top of bank of the
waterway or center line of the waterway where the bank is
undefined. All encroachments proposed under this
subsection shall be subject to review and approval by the

seq.
(c) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
standard for off-site stability in the Standards for Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under the Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq.,
then the stabilization measures in accordance with the
§ 387-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 387-4
1:325
§ 387-5. Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater
recharge.
requirements of the above standards may be placed within the
special water resource protection area, provided that:
[1] Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150 feet
of the Category One waterway;
[2] Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
section shall achieve a 95% TSS post-construction removal
rate;
[3] Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
[4] The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable;
[5] A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate NJDEP staff and Soil Conservation District
staff to identify necessary stabilization measures; and
[6] All encroachments proposed under this section shall be
subject to review and approval by the NJDEP.
(d) A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning council as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan or by the
Borough through an adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to Subsection G(8) has been approved by the
NJDEP, then the provisions of the plan shall be the applicable
special water resource protection area requirements for that
waterway. A stream corridor protection plan for a waterway
subject to Subsection G(8) shall maintain or enhance the
current functional value and overall condition of the special
water resource protection area as defined in Subsection
G(8)(a)[1] above. In no case shall a stream corridor protection

protection area to less than 150 feet as measured
perpendicular to the waterway subject to this subsection.
(e) Subsection G(8) does not apply to the construction of one
individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
§ 387-4 PENNS GROVE CODE § 387-5
1:326
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
(a) The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) methodology,
including the NRCS runoff equation and dimensionless unit
hydrograph, as described in the NRCS National Engineering
Handbook Section 4, Hydrology, and Technical Release 55, as
amended, Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds; or
(b) The rational method for peak flow and the modified rational
method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the pre-construction
condition of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at Subsection A(1)(a) and the rational and
modified rational methods at Subsection A(1)(b). A runoff
coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing
condition may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design
engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has existed on the
site or portion of the site for at least five years without interruption
prior to the time of application. If more than one land cover has
existed on the site during the five years immediately prior to the
time of application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential
shall be used for the computations. In addition, there is the
presumption that the site is in good hydrologic condition (if the
land use type is pasture, lawn, or park), with good cover (if the land
use type is woods), or with good hydrologic condition and
conservation treatment (if the land use type is cultivation).
(3) In computing pre-construction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or
culverts, that may reduce pre-construction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55, Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds, and other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
§ 387-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 387-5

recharge. Trash racks shall be installed at the intake to the outlet
structure as appropriate and shall have parallel bars with one-inch
spacing between the bars to the elevation of the water quality
design storm. For elevations higher than the water quality design
storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure shall be spaced no
greater than 1/3 the width of the diameter of the orifice or 1/3 the
width of the weir, with a minimum spacing between bars of one
inch and a maximum spacing between bars of six inches. In
addition, the design of trash racks must comply with the
requirements of § 387-8B.

40:55D-47.
X. Standards encouraging and promoting flexibility, economy and
environmental soundness in layout and design in accordance with
which the Planning Board may approve the varying, within a
conventional subdivision, of lot areas and dimensions and yards and
setbacks otherwise required by municipal development regulations in
such a way that the average lot areas and dimensions, yards and
setbacks within the subdivision conform to the conventional norms of
the municipal development regulations, provided that such standards
shall be appropriate to the type of development permitted.
Y. Promoting any other purposes or objectives of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq.,
the Penns Grove Borough Master Plan, and this chapter.
§ 400-1 PENNS GROVE CODE § 400-2

Borough official, that all approved existing monuments remain in place and
that all required new or reset monuments have been set or reset consistent
with the approved plan.
§ 400-3. Exemptions.
The following shall not be considered subdivisions within the meaning of
this chapter, if no new streets are created:
§ 400-4. Waiver of specific subdivision submission and design
requirements.
The Planning Board, when acting upon applications for preliminary or
minor subdivision approval, shall have the power to grant such exceptions
from applicable submission requirements and design standards as may
be reasonable and within the general purpose and intent of this chapter,
Chapter 450, Zoning, of this Code and the Municipal Land Use Law, if
the literal enforcement of one or more provisions of this chapter is
impracticable or will exact undue hardship because of peculiar conditions
pertaining to the land in question, and if the proposed resulting lots and the
existing and proposed structures and improvements upon them will comply
with all applicable zoning requirements.
§ 400-5. Lot requirements.
A. Divisions of land found by the Planning Board to be for agricultural
purposes where all resulting parcels are five acres or larger in size;
B. Division of property by testamentary or intestate provisions;
C. Divisions of property upon court order, including but not limited to
judgments of foreclosure;
D. Consolidation of existing lots by deed or other recorded instrument;
and
E. Conveyance of one or more adjoining lots, tracts or parcels of land
owned by the same person(s) and all of which are found and certified by
the administrative officer to conform to the requirements of the
municipal development regulations and are shown and designated as
separate lots, tracts, or parcels on the Tax Map or atlas of the Borough.
A. Unsuitable lots. All lots shall be suitable for the purpose for which they
are intended to be used.
(1) In order to prevent the use of lots which are not suitable because of
adverse topography, flood conditions, proximity to municipal
boundaries, or similar circumstances, the Planning Board may
require such revisions in the layout of the subdivision as will
accomplish one of the following:
§ 400-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 400-5
1:373
§ 400-6. Minor subdivisions.
(a) The area of any unsuitable lot is included in other lots by
increasing the size of the remaining lots and eliminating the
unsuitable lot;
(b) The unsuitable lot is included in an area to be deeded to the
Borough and held in its natural state for conservation and/or
recreation purposes;
(c) The unsuitable lot is deed restricted against unsuitable uses
and limited only to suitable uses subject to zoning
requirements; or
(d) Some other suitable arrangement is made, such as common
ownership made permanent by deed covenants running with
the land.
(2) No building or structure in a municipality other than the Borough
of Penns Grove will have street access only in Penns Grove, and no
building or structure in the Borough of Penns Grove will have street
access only in another municipality.
B. Block and lot numbers. Block and lot numbers shall be assigned for
each lot by the Tax Assessor.
C. Driveways. Existing and proposed driveway locations must be depicted
on all subdivision plans. Driveways must be located at safe distances
from all roadway intersections when applying generally accepted
engineering or other design or safety standards. Driveways must also
conform to all applicable zoning regulations.
D. Sidewalks, curbs, gutters and other improvements. Sidewalks, curbs,
gutters and other improvements are required for all subdivisions, minor
and major, as set forth in this chapter or in the Residential Site
Improvement Standards (N.J.A.C. 5:21-1.1 et seq.), as applicable, unless
waived or exempted by the Planning Board or the New Jersey
Department of Community Affairs. In the case of minor subdivisions,
applicants must depict all required improvements on the minor
subdivision plans to the Planning Board Engineer's satisfaction and
then deliver a copy of the approved plan to the Borough Engineer prior
to signature of the minor subdivision deeds by the Planning Board Chair
and Municipal Land Use Secretary. All required improvements at each
lot must thereafter be completely installed by such lot's respective
owner, and inspected and approved by the Borough, prior to issuance of
any certificate of occupancy for such lot.
E. Grading and drainage. Grading and drainage plans for all lots resulting
from minor and major subdivisions must be reviewed and approved.
A. Classification. A minor subdivision is a subdivision of land that does not
involve the creation of more than two lots, in addition to one retained or
§ 400-5 PENNS GROVE CODE § 400-6
1:374
remainder parcel, provided that such subdivision does not involve a
planned development, any new street or the extension of any off-tract
improvement, the cost of which is to be prorated pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-42.
(1) In counting lots to determine whether or not a proposed
subdivision is a minor subdivision, the following lots shall be
counted:
(a) All lots to be created by or resulting from the proposed
subdivision, including all retained or remainder parcels.
(b) All lots created by prior subdivisions out of the original parcel
of contiguous land under common ownership as it existed on
September 1, 1987.
(2) No lots shall be counted twice, and in the case of resubdivisions, lot
line adjustments or lot mergers any lot eliminated shall be
deducted and any lot replaced shall not be recounted.
B. Application requirements. Applications for minor subdivision approval
shall include applicable fees and escrow deposits.
C. Review. If the Planning Board determines that the application for
development is complete and conforms to the above definition of "minor
subdivision" and if the applicant's proposal complies with all applicable
zoning requirements and other requirements for approval, the Board
may hear and decide the application without public notice. Minor
subdivision approval shall be deemed to be final approval of the
subdivision by the Board, provided that the Board shall condition any
minor subdivision approval that it grants upon timely receipt of a
favorable report on the application by the Salem County Planning Board
as may be applicable pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:27-6.3, or approval by the
Salem County Planning Board by its failure to report thereon within the
required time period. The Board may also condition minor subdivision
approval upon ensuring the provision of certain improvements pursuant
to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-38, 40:55D-39, 40:55D-40 and 40:55D-53, as well as
provision of review and inspection escrows relating thereto, and
applicable approvals from other regulatory agencies.
D. Time for decision. Minor subdivision approval shall be granted or
denied within 45 days after completeness is certified or deemed by law,
or within such further time as may be consented to by the applicant.
E. Amendment. Applicants may amend a minor subdivision approval prior
to expiration of the approval or filing of the minor subdivision deed or
plat. Applications for amendment must include all required materials,
information and fees. Any application for amendment of an approval in
which publicly noticed site plan approval or variances were also
granted, or which involves any new site plan approval requiring public
notice or any new variance request, must be heard on public notice
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-11 and 40:55D-12. When approving an
§ 400-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 400-6
1:375
§ 400-7. Major subdivisions.
amendment to a previous approval in which variances or site plan
approval was granted, the Planning Board may modify the nature and
extent and any terms or conditions of such variances or site plan
approval. The engineer's estimate on which any posted performance
or maintenance guarantees have been calculated, and the guarantees
themselves, as well as any easements or restrictions that were required
as part of the earlier approval, should be reviewed to determine
whether any changes are necessary.
F. Expiration. Minor subdivision shall expire 190 days from the date on
which the Planning Board adopts the resolution of approval unless,
within such period, a plat in conformity with such approval and the
provisions of the Map Filing Law (N.J.S.A. 46:26B-1 et seq.), or a deed
clearly describing the approved minor subdivision, is filed by the
developer with the County Recording Officer, the Municipal Engineer
and the Municipal Tax Assessor. Any such plat or deed accepted for
such filing shall have been signed by the Chair of the Planning Board
and the Municipal Land Use Secretary.
(1) In reviewing the application for development for a proposed minor
subdivision the Planning Board may be permitted by ordinance to
accept a plat not in conformity with the Map Filing Law, provided
that if the developer chooses to file the minor subdivision as
provided herein by plat rather than deed, such plat shall conform to
the provisions of said law.
(2) The zoning requirements and general terms and conditions,
whether conditional or otherwise, upon which minor subdivision
approval was granted shall not be changed for a period of two years
after the date on which the resolution of minor subdivision
approval is adopted, provided that the approved minor subdivision
shall have been duly recorded as provided above.
(3) The recording deadline and/or approval expiration period can be
extended by the Planning Board as provided in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-47
or, if there have been no changes in the applicable zoning or the
facts and circumstances of the application, simply reaffirmed for a
new period of 190 days. Any extension or reaffirmation request for
an approval that also included any variance or publicly noticed site
plan approval granted must be heard on public notice pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-11 and 40:55D-12. Applications to extend or
reaffirm a minor subdivision approval must include all required
materials, information and fees. The engineer's estimate on which
any posted performance or maintenance guarantees have been
calculated, and the guarantees themselves, as well as any
easements or restrictions that were required as part of the earlier
approval, should be reviewed to determine whether any changes
are necessary.
§ 400-6 PENNS GROVE CODE § 400-7
1:376
A. Classification. All subdivision applications not classified as minor
pursuant to § 400-6 above shall automatically be classified as major
subdivision applications. All major subdivision applications should be
formally reviewed in two stages, preliminary and final.
B. Preliminary major subdivision application.
(1) Fees and escrow deposits. Applications for preliminary major
subdivision approval shall include all required fees and escrow
deposits.
(2) Review. The Planning Board shall review the preliminary major
subdivision application at a public hearing on public notice as
required by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-11 through 40:55D-12.2 for the
purposes of making an informed decision as to whether the
requirements necessary for preliminary approval have been met.
The plat and any other engineering documents to be submitted
shall be required in tentative form for discussion purpose for
preliminary approval. If the Planning Board requires any
substantial amendment in the layout of improvements proposed by
the developer that have been the subject of a hearing, an amended
application shall be submitted and proceeded upon, as in the case
of the original application for development. The Planning Board
shall, if the proposed subdivision complies with this chapter and
the Municipal Land Use Law, grant preliminary approval to the
subdivision.
(3) Time for decision. For a subdivision of 10 or fewer lots, the
Planning Board must grant or deny preliminary approval within 45
days following the date the application is certified or deemed
complete or within such further time as may be consented to by the
developer. For a subdivision of more than 10 lots, the Planning
Board must grant or deny preliminary approval within 95 days
following the date the application is certified or deemed complete
or within such further time as may be consented to by the
developer. Otherwise, the Planning Board shall be deemed to have
granted preliminary approval to the subdivision.
(4) Denial. In the event the Board denies the preliminary major
subdivision application, such denial must be memorialized in a
written resolution containing a statement of reasons for the denial,
a copy of which shall be given to the applicant.
(5) Other agency approvals. Review or approval by the Planning Board
does not preclude the necessity for submission, review and
approval by other reviewing authorities. These authorities may
include but are not be limited to the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection and the Salem County Planning Board.
(6) Amendment. Applicants may amend a preliminary major
subdivision approval prior to expiration of the approval or the grant
of final major subdivision approval. Applications for amendment
§ 400-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 400-7
1:377
must include all required materials, information and fees. All
applications for amended preliminary major subdivision approval
must be heard on public notice pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-11 and
40:55D-12. When approving an amendment to a previous approval
in which variances or site plan approval was granted, the Planning
Board may modify the nature and extent and any terms or
conditions of such variances or site plan approval. The engineer's
estimate on which any posted performance or maintenance
guarantees have been calculated, and the guarantees themselves,
as well as any easements or restrictions that were required as part
of the earlier approval, should be reviewed to determine whether
any changes are necessary.
(7) Expiration. Preliminary major subdivision approval shall expire
three years following the date the initial resolution of preliminary
subdivision plan approval is adopted. Except as provided in N.J.S.A.
40:55D-49d, preliminary major subdivision approval confers upon
the applicant the following rights during the aforesaid three-year
period:
(a) The general terms and conditions on which preliminary
approval was granted shall not be changed, including but not
limited to use requirements; layout and design standards for
streets, curbs and sidewalks; lot size; yard dimensions; and offtract
improvements, except that nothing herein shall be
construed to prevent the Borough from modifying by ordinance
such general terms and conditions of preliminary approval as
relate to public health and safety;
(b) The applicant may submit for final approval on or before, but
not after, the expiration date of preliminary approval the whole
or a section or sections of the preliminary subdivision plat, as
the case may be, provided that such section or sections were
depicted on and approved with the preliminary subdivision
plat; and
(c) The applicant may apply for extension(s) of preliminary major
subdivision approval as provided in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-49. All
extension requests must be heard on public notice pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-11 and 40:55D-12. Applications to extend or
reaffirm a preliminary major subdivision approval must include
all required materials, information and fees. The engineer's
estimate on which any posted performance or maintenance
guarantees have been calculated, and the guarantees
themselves, as well as any easements or restrictions that were
required as part of the earlier approval, should be reviewed to
determine whether any changes are necessary.
C. Final major subdivision application. Applications for final major
subdivision approval must be filed prior to the expiration of preliminary
approval (that is, within three years, plus any extensions, following the
§ 400-7 PENNS GROVE CODE § 400-7
1:378
date the initial resolution of preliminary major subdivision approval is
adopted). Applications for final major subdivision approval filed after
the expiration of preliminary approval will not be accepted or reviewed.
(1) Fees and escrow deposits. Applications for final major subdivision
approval must include all required fees and escrow deposits.
(2) Review. The Planning Board shall review the final major subdivision
application at a public hearing on public notice pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-11 through 40:55D-12.2 and shall grant final approval if the
detailed drawings, specifications and estimates of the application
for final approval conform to the standards established by this
chapter, the conditions of preliminary major subdivision approval,
and the standards prescribed by the Map Filing Law (N.J.S.A.
46:26B-1 et seq.). The following matters should be addressed as
part of any grant of final major subdivision approval:
(a) All road, sight triangle, drainage or other easements or
restrictions which must be granted or imposed on behalf of the
Borough or any other person or entity.
(b) The installation and maintenance of proposed improvements
that must be secured by performance and maintenance
guarantees pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53 and approval of the
engineer's cost estimate.
(c) The amount and terms of payment for off-tract improvements
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-42.
(d) The completion deadline or schedule of deadlines to be
imposed for installation of improvements that are to be
secured by performance and maintenance guarantees.
(3) Time for decision. Final approval shall be granted or denied within
45 days after the date completeness is certified, or within such
further time as may be consented to by the applicant.
(4) Denial. In the event the Board denies the final major subdivision
application, such denial must be memorialized in a written
resolution containing a statement of reasons for the denial, a copy
of which shall be given to the applicant.
(5) Other agency approvals. Whenever review or approval of the
application by the Salem County Planning Board is required by
N.J.S.A. 40:27-6.3, the Planning Board shall condition any approval
that it grants upon timely receipt of a favorable report on the
application by the County Planning Board or approval by the
County Planning Board by its failure to report thereon within the
required time period. Review or approval by the Planning Board
does not preclude the necessity for submission, review and
approval by other reviewing authorities, including but not limited
to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.

1:379
(6) Amendment. Applicants may amend a final major subdivision
approval prior to expiration of the approval or filing of the final
plat. Applications for amendment must include all required
materials, information and fees. All applications for amended final
major subdivision approval must be heard on public notice
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-11 and 40:55D-12. When approving an
amendment to a previous approval in which variances or site plan
approval was granted, the Planning Board may modify the nature
and extent and any terms or conditions of such variances or site
plan approval. The engineer's estimate on which any posted
performance or maintenance guarantees have been calculated, and
the guarantees themselves, as well as any easements or
restrictions that were required as part of the earlier approval,
should be reviewed to determine whether any changes are
necessary.
(7) Expiration. Final major subdivision approval shall expire two years
following the date the initial resolution of final major subdivision
approval is adopted, or upon such other deadline as may be
imposed by the Board pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-52b, provided
that the approval shall expire within 95 days following the signing
of the final plat if the plat is not thereafter filed in the Salem County
Clerk's office within that period as required by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-54.
Additionally, the zoning requirements applicable to the preliminary
approval first granted and all other rights conferred upon the
developer pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-49, whether conditionally or
otherwise, shall not be changed during the aforesaid two-year
period.
(a) If the developer has followed the standards prescribed for final
approval and has duly recorded the plat as required by N.J.S.A.
40:55D-54, the Planning Board may extend the approval period
for extensions of one year but not to exceed three extensions,
or as may otherwise be provided in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-52 or
40:55D-54. All extension requests must be heard on public
notice pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-11 and 40:55D-12.
Applications to extend a final major subdivision approval must
include all required materials, information and fees. The
engineer's estimate on which any posted performance or
maintenance guarantees have been calculated, and the
guarantees themselves, as well as any easements or
restrictions that were required as part of the earlier approval,
should be reviewed to determine whether any changes are
necessary.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Municipal Land
Use Law or this chapter, the granting of final approval
terminates the time period of preliminary approval pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-49 for the section granted final approval.

Signs
§ 450-50. Purpose.
It is recognized that signs perform important functions in identifying
residences and businesses. It is hereby found and declared, however, that
control of signs is necessary to promote the health, safety and general
welfare by lessening hazards to pedestrian and vehicular traffic, by
preserving property values, by preventing unsightly and detrimental
development which has a blighting influence upon residential, business and
industrial uses, by preventing signs from reaching such excessive size that
they obscure one another to the detriment of all concerned and by securing
certain fundamentals of design for the Borough.
§ 450-51. Definitions. [Amended 9-16-1997 by Ord. No. 97-13;
6-16-1998 by Ord. No. 98-9]
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
SIGN  Any permanent or temporary structure or part thereof or any
device attached, painted or represented directly or indirectly on a structure
or other surface that shall display or include any letter, word, insignia, flag
or representation used as or which is in the nature of an advertisement,
announcement, visual communication, or direction or which is designed to
attract the eye or draw the attention of the public.
§ 450-52. Area.
Exception. Flags patriotic in nature and limited to federal, state and
local government flags are exempted from the provisions of this
chapter, provided that:
The maximum number of patriotic flags in business districts shall
be limited to five for each building; the area of any one flag shall
not exceed 20 square feet.
(1)
Flags shall be displayed no lower than eight feet from the
bottommost portion of the flag to the sidewalk.
(2)
A.
A. The area of a sign shall be construed to include all lettering, wording
and accompanying designs and symbols, together with the background,
whether open or enclosed, on which they are displayed (but not
including any supporting framework and bracing which are incidental
to the display itself).
B. Where the sign consists of individual letters or symbols attached to a
building, wall or window, the area shall be considered to be that of the
smallest rectangle or other regular geometric shape which
encompasses all of the letters and symbols.

1:509
§ 450-53. Illumination.
§ 450-54. Location.
§ 450-55. Types.
C. In computing square foot area of a double-faced sign, only one side
shall be considered, provided that both faces are identical. If the
interior angle formed by the two faces of the double-faced sign is
greater than 45°, then both sides of such sign shall be considered in
calculating the sign area.
A. Directly illuminated sign. A directly illuminated sign shall be a sign
designed to give forth artificial light directly (or through transparent or
translucent material) from a source of light within such sign, including
but not limited to neon and exposed lamp signs. Festoon lighting is a
directly illuminated sign comprised of either:
(1) A group of incandescent light bulbs hung or strung overhead or on
a building or structure; or
(2) Light bulbs not shaded or hooded or otherwise screened to prevent
the direct rays of the light from shining on an adjacent property or
right-of-way.
B. Indirectly illuminated sign. An indirectly illuminated sign shall be a sign
illuminated with a light so shielded that no direct rays therefrom are
visible elsewhere on the lot where said illumination occurs. If such
shielding device is defective, such sign shall be deemed to be a directly
illuminated sign.
C. Flashing sign. A flashing sign shall be an illuminated sign on which the
artificial light is not maintained stationary and constant in intensity and
color at all times when in use.
D. Nonilluminated sign. A nonilluminated sign shall be a sign which is not
illuminated either directly or indirectly.
A. On-premises sign. An on-premises sign shall be a sign which advertises
or otherwise directs attention to an activity conducted on the same lot.
B. Advertising sign. An advertising sign shall be an off-premises sign
which advertises or otherwise directs attention to a commodity,
business, industry, home occupation or other similar activity which is
sold, offered or conducted elsewhere than on the lot upon which such
sign is located.
C. Business sign. A business sign shall be an on-premises sign which
advertises or otherwise directs attention to a business, commodity,
service, industry or other activity which is sold, offered or conducted
other than incidentally on the premises upon which such sign is located
or to which it is affixed.

6-16-1998 by Ord. No. 98-9]
E. Nonconforming signs. Signs existing at the time of passage of this
chapter, which do not conform to the requirements of this chapter, shall
be considered nonconforming signs and may continue in nonconformity.
Once removed for repair, replacement or any other reason, a
nonconforming sign shall not be replaced unless with a conforming
sign; however, nonconforming signs may be repainted or repaired in
place, provided that such action does not exceed the dimensions of the
existing sign. All nonconforming signs must be registered with the
Zoning Office. [Amended 6-16-1998 by Ord. No. 98-9; 7-5-2017 by
Ord. No. 2017-5]
F. Permit required. All signs shall require the issuance of a sign permit
from the Zoning Office before erection or replacement, except for
patriotic signs as described in § 450-51. A building permit shall also be
required by the Construction Code Official for any sign which is
permanently affixed to the ground, the building facade or the inside or

I. Yard requirements. No portion of any freestanding sign shall be located
closer to any lot line than 1/2 the required yard for the district in which
it is located, except for COS and H-C/I Districts. If this requirement
cannot be met, then freestanding signs shall be prohibited on such
properties. [Amended 6-16-1998 by Ord. No. 98-9]
J. Vehicular signs. Any vehicle to which a sign is affixed in such a manner
that carrying of such sign or signs no longer is incidental to the
vehicle's primary purpose but becomes a primary purpose in itself shall
be considered a freestanding sign and as such be subject to the
provisions regarding freestanding signs in the district in which such
vehicle is located.
K. Abandoned signs. For the purpose of this chapter, an abandoned sign(s)
is one that, after one year, said sign(s), including all hangers, brackets
or superstructures used in support or attached to said sign, no longer

of the spaces required for each use individually. However, the number
of spaces required in a common parking facility may be reduced below
this total by special exception if it can be demonstrated to the Board
that the hours or days of peak parking needed for the uses are so
different that a lower total will provide adequately for all uses served by
the facility. [Amended 6-17-1986 by Ord. No. 86-5]
F. Fractional spaces. Where the computation of required parking space
results in a fractional number, any fraction of the next highest number

ARTICLE IX
Performance Standard Subdivisions
§ 450-74. Purpose.
The purpose shall be to:
§ 450-75. Definitions.
A. Provide standards to control the amount of open space and impervious
surfaces within a development; to control the intensity of development
in areas of sensitive natural resources or natural features in order to
reduce or eliminate adverse environmental impacts; to protect the
people's right to clean air, pure water and the natural, scenic, historic
and aesthetic values of the environment; and to protect natural
resources which are a part of the ecological system to which we are all
bound and therefore are the common property of all the people,
including generations yet to come, and must be protected to ensure the
health, safety and welfare of all the people.
B. Provide standards for all types of dwelling units so that all the people
may have access to decent, sound and sanitary housing, and to meet the
goals of the Federal Housing Act of 1949.
C. Provide incentives to meet housing or environmental goals or to provide
public or special facilities.
D. Provide standards of performance which make the unique
characteristics of the land or site the determinants of its capacity for
residential use.
A. The additional definitions which follow are needed for the clarity of this
article.
B. As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ALLUVIAL SOILS  Areas subject to periodic flooding as defined in
Chapter 252, Flood Damage Prevention.
CONDOMINIUM  An ownership arrangement, not a land use;
therefore, it is allowed in any district and under the same restrictions
as the residential land uses that it comprises. A condominium shall not
negate lot or other requirements intended to provide adequate light,
air and privacy. A condominium is a dwelling unit which has all of the
following characteristics:
The unit (the interior and associated exterior areas designated for
private use in the development plan) is owned by the occupant.
(1)
(2) The unit may be any permitted dwelling type.
§ 450-74 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 450-75
1:529
FOREST  Areas, groves or stands of mature or largely mature trees
(i.e., greater than six inches caliper) covering an area greater than
1/4 acre, or groves of mature trees (greater than 12 inches caliper)
consisting of more than 10 individuals.
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE RATIO  A measure of the intensity of use of a
piece of land. It is measured by dividing the total area of all impervious
surfaces within the site by the net buildable site area.
IMPERVIOUS SURFACES  Those that do not absorb rain. All
buildings, parking areas, driveways, roads, sidewalks and any areas in
concrete and asphalt shall be considered impervious surfaces within
this definition. In addition, other areas determined by the Engineer to
be impervious within the meaning of this definition will also be classed
as impervious surfaces.
LAKES and PONDS  Natural or artificial bodies of water which retain
water year round. Artificial ponds may be created by dams or may
result from excavation. The shoreline of such water bodies shall be
measured from the maximum condition rather than permanent pool, if
there is any difference.
LOT AREA PER DWELLING UNIT, AVERAGE  The average lot area
for all dwelling units of a single type. Individual lots may be smaller or
larger than the average, provided that the average size is maintained
and that all other standards of this chapter are met.
OPEN SPACE  Land used for recreation, resource protection, amenity
or buffers, which is freely accessible to all residents and is protected
by the provisions of this chapter and Chapter 400, Subdivision of Land,
to ensure that it remains in such uses. "Open space" does not include
land occupied by buildings, roads or road rights-of-way, nor does it
include the yards or lots of single-family or multifamily dwelling units
or parking areas as required by the provisions of this chapter. Open
space shall be left in a natural state except in the case of recreation
uses which may contain impervious surfaces. Such impervious surfaces
shall be included in the calculation of the impervious surface ratio.
OPEN SPACE RATIO  A measure of the intensity of land use. It is
arrived at by dividing total amount of open space within the site by the
site area.
SITE  A parcel or parcels of land intended to have one or more
buildings or intended to be subdivided into one or more lots.
SITE AREA  All land area within the site as defined in the deed. Actual
area shall be from a survey rather than the deed.
All or a portion of the exterior open space and any community
interior spaces are owned and maintained in accordance with the
provisions for open space, roads or other development features as
specified in this chapter and Chapter 400, Subdivision of Land.

§ 450-76. Optional regulations.
Any landowner in Zone R-1 or R-2 may desire to develop his site under the
regulations set forth below rather than in § 450-17. The developer shall then
be governed by the provisions of this article.
§ 450-77. Performance standards.
All performance standard subdivisions shall meet the standards set forth
in the Table of Performance Standards. The development must meet all of
these standards, depending on the design, mix of units, shape, size and
natural properties of the site. Any one of the performance standards in this
or other sections of this chapter may limit how many units can be placed on
a given site.

STEEP SLOPES  Areas where the average slope exceeds 8% which,
because of this slope, are subject to high rates of stormwater runoff
and, therefore, erosion.
SUBDIVISION, PERFORMANCE STANDARD  A method for
developing land for residential use utilizing performance standards
(including but not limited to open space ratio, density, impervious
surface ratio and other standards as set forth in §§ 450-76 through
450-82) rather than the dimensional requirements set forth in the Table
of Dimensional Requirements.54 "Performance standard subdivisions"
allow the grouping or clustering of dwelling units, permitting a variety
of housing types to encourage better, more flexible designs. The
subdivision as a whole must meet the prescribed standards for open
space, density and impervious surfaces.
WETLANDS  Areas known as "marshes," "swamps" or "wetlands,"
including all areas greater than 1/4 acre, where standing water is
retained for a portion of the year and unique vegetation has adapted to
the area.

Subsection A(2) above shall be granted by the Planning Board upon
proof, by virtue of submission of appropriate maps, drawings, reports
and testimony, that the disturbance protects public health, safety or
welfare; provides an environmental benefit; prevents extraordinary
hardship on the property owner peculiar to the property; or prevents
extraordinary hardship, provided the hardship was not created by the
property owner, that would not permit a minimum economically viable
use of the property based upon reasonable investment. Hardship
variances may be granted by the Planning Board in cases of preexisting
lot (existing at the time of adoption of this article) when there is
insufficient room outside the riparian zone for uses permitted by the
underlying zoning and there is no other reasonable or prudent
alternative to placement in the riparian zone, including obtaining
variances from setback or other requirements that would allow
conformance with the riparian zone requirements.
D. Appeals of a determination by the Borough Engineer made in
accordance with Subsection B above may be made to the Planning
Board. The party contesting the determination or decision shall have
the burden of proof in case of any such appeal.
A. The proposed disturbance in a riparian zone is for a linear development
with no feasible alternative route. If the riparian zone is associated with

ARTICLE XIV
Development Fees
[Added 7-5-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-5]
§ 450-110. When effective.
This article shall take effect upon approval by the Superior Court of the
State of New Jersey or appropriate state regulatory agency of the State of
New Jersey.
§ 450-111. Findings and purposes.
§ 450-112. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AFFORDABLE HOUSING  Any housing unit with an acquisition price or
rent level not exceeding the maximum resale or rent level for low- and
moderate-income housing as set forth in N.J.A.C. 5:94 et seq.
COAH  The New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing, established under
the Fair Housing Act of 1985, and which has primary jurisdiction for the
administration of low- and moderate-income housing obligation in
accordance with sound regional planning considerations in the state.
DEVELOPMENT FEES  Money paid by an individual, person, partnership,
association, company, or corporation for the improvement of property as
permitted in N.J.A.C. 5:94 et seq.
EQUALIZED ASSESSED VALUE  The value of a property determined
by the Borough Tax Assessor through a process designed to ensure that
all property in the Borough is assessed at the same assessment ratio or
ratios required by law. Estimates at the time of building permit may be
A. The New Jersey Supreme Court, in Holmdel Builders Ass'n v. Holmdel
Twp., 121 N.J. 550 (1990), determined that mandatory development
fees are both statutorily and constitutionally permissible. The Court
further anticipated that COAH would promulgate appropriate
development fee rules specifying, among other things, the standards for
these development fees. The purpose of this article is to provide such
rules pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:94 et seq.
B. The Borough Council finds and declares that the creation and
preservation of affordable housing in the Borough serves the public
interest. Maintaining and improving a stock of sound affordable
housing requires affirmative steps by local government working
cooperatively with public bodies at all levels and with the private sector.
The purpose of this article is to create in the Borough of Penns Grove a
trust fund from payment of development fees to assist in the marshaling
of public and private moneys dedicated to affordable housing projects
and programs.
§ 450-110 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 450-112
1:559
obtained by the Tax Assessor utilizing estimates for construction cost. Final
equalized assessed value will be determined at project completion by the
Tax Assessor.
SUBSTANTIVE CERTIFICATION  A determination by COAH approving the
Borough's Housing Element and Fair Share Plan in accordance with the
provisions of the Fair Housing Act and the rules and criteria as set forth
therein. A grant of substantive certification shall be valid for a period of 10
years in accordance with the terms and conditions contained therein.
§ 450-113. Development fee schedule.
§ 450-114. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions.
A. Residential development.
(1) Residential development fees shall be 1.5% of the equalized
assessed value for residential development, within the R-1, R-2,
R-3, COS, M-1 and M-2 Districts, which is not exempt from the
provisions of this subsection as set forth in this article, provided
that no increase in density is permitted.
(2) If a "d" variance is granted by the Borough Planning Board
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d(5), then the additional residential
units realized (above what is permitted by right under the existing
zoning) will incur a bonus development fee of 6% rather than the
development fee of 1.5%. However, if the zoning on a site has
changed during the two-year period preceding the filing of the "d"
variance application, the base density for the purposes of
calculating the bonus development fee shall be the highest density
permitted by right during the two years preceding the filing with
the Borough Planning Board of the "d" variance application.
B. Nonresidential development.
(1) Nonresidential development fees shall be 2.5% of the equalized
assessed value for nonresidential development, within all zoning
districts, which is not exempt from the provisions of this subsection
as set forth in this article.
(2) If a "d" variance is granted by the Borough Planning Board
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d(4), then the additional floor area
ratio (FAR) realized (above what is permitted by right under the
existing zoning) will incur a bonus development fee of 6% rather
than the development fee of 2.5%. However, if the zoning on a site
has changed during the two-year period preceding the filing of the
"d" variance application, the base density for the purposes of
calculating the bonus development fee shall be the highest density
permitted by right during the two years preceding the filing with
the Borough Planning Board of the "d" variance application.
§ 450-112 PENNS GROVE CODE § 450-114
1:560
§ 450-115. Collection of development fees.
The Borough shall collect 50% of the fee on any specific development prior
to and as a condition of the issuance of the building permit therefor. The
remaining portion shall be collected prior to and as a condition of the
issuance of the certificate of occupancy. Once the final equalized assessed
value of a particular development has been determined by the Tax Assessor,
and such final equalized assessed value is greater than the estimated
equalized assessed value, the developer shall, within 10 business days from
receipt of notification from the Borough, pay to the Borough the difference
between the development fees required to be paid by the developer once
such final equalized assessed value has been determined and the estimated
development fees actually paid by the developer. The failure of the
developer to make timely payments of the aforesaid deficiency shall entitle
the Borough to file, without notice to the developer, a lien against the
subject development. In the event that the Borough shall file such lien, the
Borough may add to the aforesaid deficiency amount reasonable attorney
fees to file and discharge such lien, together with any and all costs incurred
A. Except as provided in § 450-113A(2) above, developers of low- and
moderate-income units shall be exempt from development fees.
B. Development fees may only be collected for any residential structure
which requires the installation of a new foundation (excluding
foundations required for an addition to or renovation of an existing
residential structure or a foundation required for an accessory
structure to an existing residential structure).
C. All forms of new nonresidential construction shall be subject to
development fees; provided, however, that development fees may only
be collected for improvements which add usable or rentable footage to
an existing nonresidential structure. In the event that a development
fee is collected for a nonresidential structure and thereafter usable or
rentable footage is obtained through modification of said structure, a
development fee may be collected for the additional usable or rentable
footage based upon the increase in the equalized assessed value of the
improved structure.
D. Developments that have received preliminary or final approval prior to
the adoption and final publication of this article shall be exempt from
development fees unless the developer seeks a substantial change in
the approval.
E. The Borough exempts the following types of development from
imposition of development fees:
(1) Development by the Borough or any of its instrumentalities; and
(2) Development by charitable or not-for-profit entities formed and
legally established in accordance with the laws of the State of New
Jersey.
§ 450-114 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 450-115
1:561
to file and discharge said lien. In the event that the estimated equalized
assessed value proves to have been too high, the Borough shall promptly
refund the difference between the estimated development fees actually paid
by the developer and the development fees required to be paid by the
developer once such final equalized assessed value has been determined.
§ 450-116. Contested fees.
Imposed and collected development fees that are challenged shall be placed
in an interest-bearing escrow account by the Chief Financial Officer of
the Borough. If all or a portion of the contested fees are returned to
the developer, the accrued interest on the returned amount shall also be
returned.
§ 450-117. Housing trust fund.
All development fees shall be deposited with the Chief Financial Officer of
the Borough in a separate designated interest-bearing housing trust fund.
The development fees placed in the housing trust fund shall be deemed
"dedicated revenues" as such term is defined in N.J.S.A. 40A:4-36. In
establishing the housing trust fund, the Borough shall provide written
authorization, in the form of a three-party escrow agreement between the
Borough, the bank and COAH, to permit COAH to direct the disbursement
of the funds as provided for in N.J.A.C. 5:94-6.16(b). This three-party escrow
agreement shall be submitted to COAH within seven days from the opening
of the trust fund account. All interest accrued in the housing trust fund shall
only be used on eligible affordable housing activities approved by COAH.
§ 450-118. Use of money.
A. The Borough shall use revenues collected from development fees for
any activity approved by COAH for addressing the Borough's fair share
obligation. Such activities include, but are not limited to, rehabilitation,
new construction, regional contribution agreements, purchase of new
land for low- and moderate-income housing, improvement of land to be
used for low- and moderate-income housing, extension and/or
improvement of roads and infrastructure to low- and moderate-income
housing sites, assistance designed to render units to be more affordable
and administration of the implementation of the Housing Element and
Fair Share Plan. The expenditure of all money shall conform to a
spending plan approved by COAH.
B. Funds shall not be expended to reimburse the Borough for past housing
activities.
C. After subtracting development fees collected to finance a regional
contribution agreement, a rehabilitation program or a new construction
project that are necessary to address the municipality's affordable
housing obligation, at least 30% of the balance remaining shall be used
to provide affordability assistance to low- and moderate-income
households in affordable units included in a municipal Fair Share Plan.
§ 450-115 PENNS GROVE CODE § 450-118
1:562
§ 450-119. Monitoring.
The Borough shall complete and return to COAH all monitoring forms
related to the collection of development fees, expenditures of revenues,
and implementation of the spending plan (discussed in § 450-120 below)
certified by COAH. Financial reports, annual program implementation, and
monitoring reports shall be completed by the Borough on forms designed by
COAH.
§ 450-120. Spending plans.
The Borough shall submit to COAH a spending plan for the development
fees collected by it prior to the expiration of its substantive certification
period. Plans to spend development fees shall consist of the following
information:
One-third of the affordability assistance portion of development fees
collected shall be used to provide affordability assistance to those
households earning 30% or less of median income by region.
(1) Affordability assistance programs may include down payment
assistance, security deposit assistance, low-interest loans, and
rental assistance.
(2) Affordability assistance to households earning 30% or less of
median income may include buying down the cost of low-income
units in a municipal Fair Share Plan to make them affordable to
households earning 30% or less of median income. The use of
development fees in this manner shall entitle a municipality to
bonus credits pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:94-4.22.
(3) Payments in lieu of constructing affordable units on site and funds
from the sale of units with extinguished controls shall be exempt
from the affordability assistance requirement.
D. No more than 20% of the revenues collected from development fees
shall be expended on administration, including but not limited to
salaries and benefits for Borough employees or consultant fees
necessary to develop or implement a rehabilitation program, a new
construction program, a regional contribution agreement, a housing
element and fair share plan, and an affirmative marketing program.
Administrative funds may be used for income qualification of
households, monitoring the turnover of sale and rental units, and
compliance with COAH's monitoring requirements. Development fees
shall not be used to defray the costs of existing staff.
A. A projection of revenues anticipated from imposing fees on
development, based on historic activity;
B. A description of the administrative mechanism that the Borough will
use to collect and distribute revenues;
§ 450-118 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 450-120

C. A description of the anticipated use of all development fees;
D. A schedule for the creation or rehabilitation of housing units;
E. In the event that the Borough envisions being responsible for public

F. The manner through which the Borough will address any expected or
unexpected shortfall if the anticipated revenues from development fees
are not sufficient to implement the plan;
G. A description of the funds anticipated; and
H. A schedule for spending.
A. In the event that any of the conditions set forth in Subsection B of this
section occur, COAH shall be authorized, on behalf of the Borough, to
direct the manner in which all development fees collected pursuant to
§ 450-117 shall be expended. Should any such condition occur, such
revenues shall immediately become available for expenditure at the
direction of COAH upon the Borough Clerk's receipt of written
notification from COAH that such a condition has occurred.
B. Occurrence of the following may result in COAH taking an action
pursuant to Subsection A of this section:
(1) Failure to submit a spending plan pursuant to § 450-120 above
within the time limits imposed by COAH;
(2) Failure to meet deadlines for information required by COAH in its
review of the Borough's Housing Element and Fair Share Plan, or

§ 450-120 PENNS GROVE CODE § 450-121
1:564
§ 450-122. Effect of expiration of substantive certification.
The ability of the Borough of Penns Grove to impose, collect and expend
development fees shall expire with the expiration of its substantive
certification unless the Borough has filed a revised and adopted Housing
Element and Fair Share Plan, has petitioned for substantive certification
for the succeeding round, and has received COAH's approval of a revised
development fee ordinance prior to the expiration. If the Borough fails to
act before the expiration of its substantive certification, the Borough may
only resume the imposition and collection of development fees by filing
a revised and adopted Housing Element and Fair Share Plan, petitioning
for substantive certification for the succeeding round and after receiving
COAH's approval of a revised development fee ordinance. The Borough of
Penns Grove shall not impose a development fee on a development that
receives preliminary or final approval after the expiration of its substantive
certification, nor shall the Borough retroactively impose a development fee
on such a development. The Borough of Penns Grove shall not expend
development fees after the expiration of its substantive certification.
(9) Revocation of the Borough's substantive certification; or
(10) Other good cause demonstrating that the revenues are not being
used for the intended purpose.
