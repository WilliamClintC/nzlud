Wards
[Adopted 12-20-2004 by L.L. No. 11-2004]
§ 12-1. Legislative intent.
Subdivision 1 of § 85 of the Town Law provides that whenever a proposition
shall have been adopted for the establishment of the ward system and
the election thereafter of one Councilperson from each ward, the Board
of Elections of Rockland County shall divide the Town into wards and fix
the boundaries thereof. Pursuant to the Municipal Home Rule Law § 10,
Subdivision 1(ii)d(3), the Town Board, by local law, can supersede in its
application to it, any provision of the Town Law relating to the property,
affairs or government of the Town, unless the State Legislature shall have
prohibited the adoption of such local law. The boundary of a ward system
is a permissible subject of a local law and there is no state law prohibiting
the adoption of this article. The Town Board believes that the Town is best
suited to fix the boundaries of each ward. Other towns have done so.
§ 12-2. Ward boundaries.
Whenever a proposition shall have been adopted in the Town for the
establishment of the ward system and the election thereafter of one
Councilperson from each ward, the Town Board shall divide the Town into
four wards and fix the boundaries thereof, unless a proposition shall have
been adopted to increase the number of Councilpersons from four to six, in
which instance, the Town Board shall divide the Town into six wards and fix
the boundaries thereof. The division shall be made so that the number of
inhabitants in each ward, based upon the last regular federal census, shall
be substantially equal, with wards composed of convenient and contiguous
territory in as compact form as practicable. No election district heretofore
or hereinafter created under the Election Law shall contain parts of two
or more wards. The Town Board shall make appropriate revisions of the
boundaries of the wards so that they shall contain a substantially equal
number of inhabitants not later than six months after the publication of the
results of a regular federal census which indicated that the districts do not
contain a substantially equal number of inhabitants. When the Town Board
shall have finally determined the boundaries of the wards, it shall cause a
map of the Town to be prepared, showing, in detail, the location of each
ward and the boundaries thereof. The original map so made shall be filed in
the office of the Town Clerk and copies thereof shall be filed in the offices of
the County Clerk and the Board of Elections of Rockland County. The ward
system shall be deemed established after such filing is complete.

§ 37-4. Statutory authority; legislative intent. [Amended 2-6-2012
by L.L. No. 2-2012]
The Deputy Building Inspector is a Town officer position. Pursuant to § 3
of the Public Officers Law and § 23 of the Town Law, a Town officer must
be a resident of the Town. However, pursuant to the Municipal Home Rule
Law, § 10(1)(ii)(a)(1), the Town may adopt a local law in relation to the
qualifications of its officers and permit the Deputy Building Inspectors to
reside outside the Town but within the County of Rockland. The provisions
of § 3 of the Public Officers Law and § 23 of the Town Law as they apply to
residency of Town officers are not general laws but special laws since said
state law provisions have been amended to delete residency requirements
for various Town officers in other towns throughout the state.
§ 37-5. Residency requirement.
Deputy Building Inspectors are authorized to reside outside the Town but
within the County of Rockland to be eligible to hold such position in the
Town of Ramapo.

Director of Purchasing
[Adopted 8-14-1991 by L.L. No. 12-1991]
§ 37-6. Residency requirement.
§ 37-7. Elimination of term of office. [Added 8-5-1998 by L.L. No.
6-1998]
A. The Director of Purchasing is a Town officer position. Pursuant to § 3 of
the Public Officers Law and § 23 of the Town Law, a Town officer must
be a resident of the Town. However, pursuant to the Municipal Home
Rule Law, § 10(1)(ii)(a)(1), the Town may adopt a local law in relation to
the qualifications of its officers and permit the Director of Purchasing to
reside outside the Town but within the County of Rockland. The
provisions of § 3 of the Public Officers Law and § 23 of the Town Law as
they apply to residency of Town officers are not general laws but special
laws since said state law provisions have been amended to delete
residency requirements for various Town officers in other towns
throughout the state.
B. Any person holding the position of Director of Purchasing is authorized
to reside outside the Town but within the County of Rockland to be
eligible to hold such position in the Town of Ramapo.
A. The Director of Purchasing is a Town officer position. Pursuant to
§ 20(3)(e) of the Town Law, the Director of Purchasing shall have a term
of two years. Further, the position of Director of Purchasing is a position
in the competitive class of the classified service. Pursuant to the Civil
Service Law, positions in the competitive class hold permanent
appointment without any term. However, pursuant to the Municipal
Home Rule Law, § 10(1)(ii)(d)(3), the Town Board, by local law, can
supersede in its application to it any provision of the Town Law relating
to the property, affairs or government of the Town, unless the State
Legislature shall have prohibited the adoption of such local law. The
term of office is a permissible subject of a local law. There is no state
law prohibiting the adoption of this article. The Town Board believes

Building Inspector II
[Adopted 12-18-1991 by L.L. No. 17-1991]
§ 37-8. Statutory authority; legislative intent.
The Building Inspector II is a Town officer position. Pursuant to § 3 of the
Public Officers Law and § 23 of the Town Law, a Town officer must be
a resident of the Town. However, pursuant to the Municipal Home Rule
Law, § 10(1)(ii)(a)(1), the Town may adopt a local law in relation to the
qualifications of its officers and permit the Building Inspector II to reside
outside the Town but within the County of Rockland. The provisions of § 3 of
the Public Officers Law and § 23 of the Town Law as they apply to residency
of building inspectors are not general laws but special laws since said state
law provisions have been amended to delete residency requirements for
building inspectors in other towns throughout the state.
§ 37-9. Residency requirement.
Any person holding the position of Building Inspector II is authorized to
reside outside the Town but within the County of Rockland to be eligible to
hold such position in the Town of Ramapo.

Town Constabulary
[Adopted 5-9-2012 by L.L. No. 3-2012]
§ 37-10. Legislative intent.
§ 37-11. Establishment of Town Constabulary.
The Town of Ramapo hereby establishes a Town Constabulary, the members
of which shall be authorized to act in the capacity of uniformed court
officers, and shall have the responsibilities generally associated with such
position in and about the Town Court as hereinafter set forth. Town
Constables shall be appointed by the Town Board, but shall work under the
direct supervision of the Town Justices.
§ 37-12. Status as peace officers.
Persons holding the position of Town Constable shall have the status of, and
shall be granted and exercise the powers of, a "peace officer" under the
general laws of the State of New York.
§ 37-13. Powers and duties of Town Constables, generally.
Town Constables shall have those powers and responsibilities consistent
and generally associated with a court officer in the State of New York,
including but not necessarily limited to:
A. The Town of Ramapo Justice Court, like most local town and village
courts throughout the state, conducts its actual courtroom sessions
(both criminal and civil) on a regular, but generally less than full-time,
schedule. As such, the court does not require full-time courtroom
security, or the personnel costs associated with a staff of full-time court
security officers. That fact notwithstanding, the need for armed security
personnel in and about local courtrooms, in order to ensure that
weapons and other contraband that could pose a significant and
imminent danger not only to court personnel, but to those members of
the public who have business before the court, is more apparent today
than ever before. Relatively minor matters between parties have been
seen to erupt into violence in our courtrooms; and, recently, in one local
Rockland County Village court, a spectator secreted a firearm into the
courtroom and discharged it nearly striking the sitting Justice.
B. The use of full-time police officers for courtroom security is not only
costly, but takes trained officers away from the other duties for which
they were hired. The creation and use of a Town Constabulary,
consisting of part-time peace officers, rather than full-time police
officers, is a cost effective means by which to address a very real need
confronting the Town, without interfering with its other law
enforcement responsibilities.
§ 37-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 37-13
1:39
§ 37-14. Firearms and other training.
No person holding the position of Town Constable shall carry or otherwise
possess a firearm on Town property other than in conformity with state and
federal law, and after having successfully completed such initial training
and instruction, and any required in service of follow-up training and
instruction, required for a peace officer authorized to carry a firearm under
the laws of the State of New York.
A. Attending sessions of the Town Court to maintain order and decorum in
the courtroom;
B. Calming disruptive individuals;
C. Barring entry into secure areas of and about the courtroom;
D. Addressing and attending to disruptive prisoners, litigants and
spectators involved in court proceedings;
E. Escorting, guarding and delivering jurors, witnesses and other
participants of court proceedings to and from the courtroom;
F. Escorting, guarding and delivering the Judge and/or Clerk to and from
the courtroom, as may be required;
G. Delivering materials to sequestered juries;
H. Escorting court clerks with bank deposits to and from the court offices
and courthouse to the bank;
I. Using established search procedures and equipment to assure that no
weapons, contraband or other prohibited items or materials are
brought into the courthouse or courtroom;
J. Carrying, displaying and using a firearm, subject to any permit, training
and certification requirements and qualifications otherwise imposed by
law;
K. Effecting arrests as required and authorized.

Police Officers
[Adopted 7-19-2018 by L.L. No. 4-2018]
§ 37-15. Statutory authority; legislative intent.
This article is adopted pursuant to the provisions of § 10(1)(ii)(a)(1) of the
Municipal Home Rule Law of the State of New York, which grants to local
governments the authority to enact local laws regarding the qualifications
of local officers which are not inconsistent with general state statutes.
Furthermore, this article recognizes that the New York State Legislature
amended Public Officers Law at § 3 exempting certain local officers from
a residency requirement therefore rendering said section of the Public
Officers Law to be a special rather than general law. Therefore, this article
properly sets forth residency requirements for police officers in the Town
of Ramapo. Nothing herein shall abrogate the requirements of New York
State Civil Service Law concerning the other qualifications necessary to be
employed as a police officer. Further, this article shall supersede § 3 of the
Public Officers Law of the State of New York and, to the extent required,
§ 23 of the Town Law of the State of New York in their application to the
Town of Ramapo for the position of a Town of Ramapo police officer.
§ 37-16. Residency requirement.
The person or persons holding the position of a Town of Ramapo police
officer at the same time of the initial administration of the oath of office as
a police officer in the Town of Ramapo shall have been a Town of Ramapo
resident for at least one year immediately before taking said initial oath
of office and shall be required to remain a Town of Ramapo resident at
all times for at least two years after taking said initial oath of office as a
Town of Ramapo police officer. Nothing herein shall preclude the Town of
Ramapo from hiring those applicants from special lists lawfully established
from time to time by the Rockland County Department of Personnel for
necessary individuals with specific language skills without regard to the
aforesaid residency requirements. The terms "resident" or "residency" as
used in this section shall be the same as defined as a "residence" under
New York State Election Law § 1-104(22). Nothing herein shall apply to any
newly hired police officers for the Town of Ramapo as a result of any merger
or disbandment of any police department within the County of Rockland,
New York.

§ 42-4. Legislative intent.
The members of the Planning Board and Zoning Board of Appeals of the

that such individuals have access to all information necessary for them
to properly and knowledgeably accomplish their important function. While
desirous of ensuring that the members of such Boards receive necessary
training, the Town Board is cognizant of the time demanded of such
individuals to accomplish this civic function. Accordingly, while requiring
the members of such Boards to receive training, this article permits
accommodation of individuals who, because of time constraints, are unable
to satisfy its educational requirements within a specified period of time.

Best Value Contracts
[Adopted 6-24-2015 by L.L. No. 2-2015]
§ 51-1. Title.
This article shall be known as the "Ramapo Best Value Contract Award Law"
§ 51-2. Legislative intent.
A. General Municipal Law § 103 provides local governments greater
flexibility in awarding contracts, including contracts for service work on
the basis of best value. The state legislation requires municipalities
with a population of less than $1,000,000 to pass a local law authorizing
the use of the best value award process.
B. Enactment of this legislation provides additional procurement options
to localities in ways that may expedite the procurement process and
result in cost savings. The best value standard for selecting goods and
service vendors, including janitorial and security contracts, is critical to
efforts to use strategic sourcing principles to modernize the supply
chain and ensure that taxpayers obtain the highest quality goods and
services at the lowest potential cost, while also ensuring fairness to all
competitors.
C. With the increased complexity of the goods and services that
municipalities must obtain in order to serve taxpayers, it is critical to
consider selection and evaluation criteria that measure factors other
than cost in the strictest sense.
D. Taxpayers are not well served when a public procurement results in low
unit costs at the outset, but ultimately engenders cost escalations due
to factors such as inferior quality, poor reliability and difficulty of
maintenance. Best value procurement links the procurement process
directly to the municipality's performance requirements, incorporating
selection factors such as useful lifespan, quality and options to
incentives for more timely performance and/or additional services.
E. Even if the initial expenditure is higher, considering the total value over
the life of the procurement may result in a better value and long-term
investment of public funds. Best value procurement also encourages
competition and, in turn, often results in better pricing, quality and
customer service. Fostering healthy competition ensures that bidders
will continue to strive for excellence in identifying and meeting
municipalities' needs, including such important goals as the
participation of small, minority and women-owned businesses, and the
development of environmentally preferable goods and service delivery
methods. Best value procurement will provide much-needed flexibility
in obtaining important goods and services at favorable prices, and will
reduce the time to procure such goods and services.
§ 51-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 51-3
1:51
§ 51-3. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
BEST VALUE  The basis for awarding contracts for services to the offerer
which optimizes quality, cost and efficiency, among responsive and
responsible offerers. Such basis shall reflect, wherever possible, objective
and quantifiable analysis.
§ 51-4. Requirements.
A. Where the basis for award is the best value offer, the Director of
Purchasing shall document, in the procurement record and in advance
of the initial receipt of offers, the determination of evaluation criteria
which, whenever possible, shall be quantifiable, and the process to be
used in the determination of best value and the manner in which the
evaluation process and selection shall be conducted.
B. The Director of Purchasing shall select a formal competitive
procurement process in accordance with guidelines established by the
Town's purchasing policy and document its determination in the
procurement record. The process shall include, but is not limited to, a
clear statement of need; a description of the required specifications
governing performance and related factors; a reasonable process for
ensuring a competitive field; a fair and equal opportunity for offerers to
submit responsive offers; and a balanced and fair method of award.
Where the basis for the award is best value, documentation in the
procurement record shall, where practicable, include quantification of
the application of criteria to the rating of proposals and the evaluation
results or, where not practicable, such other justification which
demonstrates that best value will be achieved.
C. The solicitation shall prescribe the minimum specifications or
requirements that must be met in order to be considered responsive
and shall describe and disclose the general manner in which the
evaluation and selection shall be conducted. Where appropriate, the
solicitation shall identify the relative importance and/or weight of cost
and the overall technical criterion to be considered by the Town in its
determination of best value.
D. The Director of Purchasing shall develop procedures that will govern
the award of contracts on the basis of best value. These procedures
shall be included in the Town's purchasing policy and reviewed annually
by the Town board in conjunction with its annual review and approval of
the Town's purchasing policy.

ALARM SYSTEMS
§ 86-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Automated Alarm Systems Law of the
Town of Ramapo."
§ 86-2. Legislative intent.
The Police Department of the Town of Ramapo has reported to the Town
Board extraordinary numbers of false alarms emanating from automated
alarm systems. These false alarms unnecessarily require that our police
and volunteer fire departments respond in an emergency fashion to signals
which should not have been created in the first place, depriving the citizens
of this Town from the sorely needed services of our emergency forces, and
expose the police and firemen to unnecessary hazards and risks. Therefore,
it is the intent of this chapter to reduce the occurrence of false alarms
and provide a mechanism whereby those responsible for the creation of
these false alarms are to be dealt with in an appropriate fashion. It is not
the intent to discourage the use of automated equipment, but rather to
encourage the use of automated equipment that fulfills the function it is
intended to perform.
§ 86-3. Definitions.
For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:
ALARM DEVICE  A mechanical, electrical or electronic device which,
when activated, will transmit a signal which is intended to create a response
from either a fire department or police department, or other emergency
service, whether or not the signal generated is audible, visible or electronic,
and whether such signal is automatic or otherwise.
ALARM INSTALLER  Any person, firm, corporation or business entity
who or which has installed and/or receives compensation for service or
maintenance of a burglar or fire alarm device from a resident upon whose
property the device has been installed.
ALARM USER  Any person, firm, corporation or business entity upon
whose premises an alarm device is installed or operating.
FALSE ALARM  A signal transmitted to either a fire or police department,
or a central alarm station, or an outside audible signal indicating that a fire
or criminal act or emergency is occurring, when in fact neither a criminal
act nor a fire or emergency is occurring.
POLICE DEPARTMENT  Police Department of the Town of Ramapo.
PREMISES  Any building, dwelling or residence on which an alarm device
has been installed.
§ 86-4. Registration of alarm device or system of alarm devices.
§ 69-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 86-4
1:63
§ 86-5. Alarm installer license.
Any alarm installer contracted to install an alarm device or system of alarm
devices must be licensed to perform home improvement pursuant to a
license issued by the Rockland County Office of Consumer Protection.
§ 86-6. False alarms.
It shall be unlawful for any alarm user or alarm installer to permit or
allow an alarm device to signal a false alarm, whether intentionally or
unintentionally, or whether due to malfunction as otherwise.
§ 86-7. Termination of outside audible signal.
If an alarm device activates an outside audible signal, such outside audible
signal cannot be broadcast for more than 30 minutes after initial activation.
§ 86-8. Penalties for offenses.
A. It shall be unlawful for any alarm installer to install an alarm device or
system of alarm devices or an alarm user to own, have or maintain the
same on a premises without registering the same with the Police
Department within 10 days after the installation of said alarm devices.
Said registration shall provide the following information:
(1) Name, home address and telephone number of the owner(s).
(2) Business address and telephone number of the owner(s).
(3) Name, address and telephone number of any person living within
the Town of Ramapo who shall be deemed to be a caretaker,
handyman or person watching the premises for the owner, if there
is any such person.
(4) Name, address and telephone number of the company which owns,
leases, rents, installs and/or maintains the automatic fire alarm
systems.
B. Each person submitting registration information shall receive an alarm
device system registration permit which must be prominently displayed
on the premises where the alarm device system is located.
C. All existing alarm users must register their alarm device or system of
alarm devices within 90 days of the effective date of this chapter.
A. A violation of §§ 86-4 and 86-5 shall be punishable by a fine of not less
than $100 nor more than $250.
B. A violation of §§ 86-6 and 86-7 shall be punishable by the following

This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Waterfowl Law."
§ 93-12. Legislative intent.
Many public lands of the Town of Ramapo are inhabited by large numbers
of waterfowl. Said waterfowl have become a nuisance to the enjoyment of

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Aquifer and Well Field
Protection Zone Law for the Town of Ramapo."
§ 96-2. Intent and legislative findings.
The Town Board, in adopting this chapter, is desirous of preventing the
introduction to the watershed of materials that pose a threat to the
watershed and hence public health and safety. These include chemicals,
petroleum products and by-products, salts, and hazardous substances.
Since many of the uses generating such products are prohibited by Chapter
376, Zoning, of the Code of the Town of Ramapo, this chapter requires the
identification of any potential point of introduction primarily through the
site plan review process. Many permitted uses use chemicals that can be
introduced through floor drains, septic systems, or even through the sewage
collection and treatment systems. With the advent of on-site stormwater
runoff control systems, there is a potential to introduce these materials to
the watershed if drainage facilities are not designed to prevent potential
contamination.
§ 96-3. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AQUIFER AND WELL FIELD PROTECTION ZONE  The area of the Town
of Ramapo as contained on the Town's Aquifer and Well Field Protection
Zone Map6 representing wells, streams, water bodies, watercourses and
buffers.
FLOOR DRAINS  Any opening in a floor or surface which receives spilled
materials.
HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES  Any substance listed pursuant to Article
37 of the New York State Environmental Conservation Law and the Rules
and Regulations of the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation as a "hazardous substance."

§ 149-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Floodplain and Flood
Hazard Management Law of the Town of Ramapo."
§ 149-2. Findings.
The Town Board of the Town of Ramapo finds that the potential and/
or actual damages from flooding and erosion may be a problem to the
residents of the Town of Ramapo and that such damages may include
destruction or loss of private and public housing, damage to public facilities,
both publicly and privately owned, and injury to and loss of human life. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
and objectives hereinafter set forth, this chapter is adopted.
§ 149-3. Statement of purpose.
A. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1) Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property
due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;
(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation of floodwaters;
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which
may increase erosion or flood damages;
(5) Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally
divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
(6) Qualify and maintain for participation in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
§ 144-40 RAMAPO CODE § 149-3

§ 149-4. Definitions.
B. Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are:
(1) To protect human life and health;
(2) To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
(3) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general
public;
(4) To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, sewer lines, streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
(6) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize
future flood blight areas;
(7) To provide that developers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
(8) To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
A. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
B. As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
APPEAL  A request for a review of the local administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a
variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO, AH or VO Zone on
a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one-percentor-
greater annual chance of flooding to an average annual depth of one
foot to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where
the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be
evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  The land in the floodplain
within a community subject to a one-percent-or-greater chance of
flooding in any given year. This area may be designated as Zone A,
AE, AH, AO, A1-A30, A99, V, VO, VE, or V1-V30. It is also commonly
referred to as the "base floodplain" or "one-hundred-year floodplain."
For purposes of this chapter, the term "special flood hazard area
§ 149-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 149-4
1:131
(SFHA)" is synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special
flood hazard."
BASE FLOOD  The flood having a one-percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT  That portion of a building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
BUILDING  See "structure."
CELLAR  Has the same meaning as "basement."
CRAWL SPACE  An enclosed area beneath the lowest elevated floor,
18 inches or more in height, which is used to service the underside
of the lowest elevated floor. The elevation of the floor of this enclosed
area, which may be of soil, gravel, concrete or other material, must
be equal to or above the lowest adjacent exterior grade. The enclosed
crawl space area shall be properly vented to allow for the equalization
of hydrostatic forces which would be experienced during periods of
flooding.
DEVELOPMENT  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved
real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures,
mining, dredging, filling, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
ELEVATED BUILDING  A nonbasement building i) built, in the case of
a building in Zones A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X or D, to have the
top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in Zones V1-30, VE,
or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of
the elevated floor, elevated above the ground level by means of pilings,
columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the
water; and ii) adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural
integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the
base flood. In the case of Zones A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X
or D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means
of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of Zones
V1-V30, VE or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise
meeting the definition of "elevated building," even though the lower
area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls that meet the federal
standards.

Agency as part of a riverine community's Flood Insurance Study. The
FBFM delineates a regulatory floodway along watercourses studied in
detail in the Flood Insurance Study.
FLOOD ELEVATION STUDY  An examination, evaluation and
determination of the flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding
§ 149-4 RAMAPO CODE § 149-4
1:132
water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and
determination of flood-related erosion hazards.
FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM)  An official map of a
community, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency,

and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.
FLOODWAY  Has the same meaning as "regulatory floodway."
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE  A use which cannot perform its
intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity
to water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading
and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, and ship repair
facilities. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacturing,
sales, or service facilities.

hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or
flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the
Town of Ramapo, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
§ 149-9. Designation of local administrator.
The Building Inspector is hereby appointed local administrator to
administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying floodplain
development permits in accordance with its provisions.
§ 149-10. Floodplain development permit purpose; fees; application
requirements.
A. Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for all
construction and other development to be undertaken in areas of
special flood hazard in this community for the purpose of protecting its
citizens from increased flood hazards and ensuring that new
development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its exposure to
flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any development in an area
of special flood hazard, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
enumerated in § 149-5, without a valid floodplain development permit.
Application for a permit shall be made on forms furnished by the local
administrator and may include, but not be limited to, plans, in
duplicate, drawn to scale and showing: the nature, location,
dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed
structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location
of the foregoing.
B. Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be
accompanied by the required fee in accordance with the Standard
Schedule of Fees of the Town of Ramapo. In addition, the applicant shall
be responsible for reimbursing the Town of Ramapo for any additional
costs necessary for review, inspection and approval of this project. The
local administrator may require a deposit of no more than $500 to cover
these additional costs.
§ 149-7 RAMAPO CODE § 149-10
1:138
C. Application for a permit. The applicant shall provide the following
information as appropriate. Additional information may be required on
the permit application form.
(1) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest
floor (including basement or cellar) of any new or substantially
improved structure to be located in Zones A1-A30, AE or AH, or
Zone A if base flood elevation data are available. Upon completion
of the lowest floor, the permitee shall submit to the local
administrator the as-built elevation, certified by a licensed
professional engineer or surveyor.
(2) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any
new or substantially improved nonresidential structure will be
floodproofed. Upon completion of the floodproofed portion of the
structure, the permitee shall submit to the local administrator the
as-built floodproofed elevation, certified by a professional engineer
or surveyor.
(3) A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that
any utility floodproofing will meet the criteria in § 149-12D,
Utilities.
(4) A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that
any nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the
floodproofing criteria in § 149-12F, nonresidential structures.
(5) A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development. Computations by
a licensed professional engineer must be submitted that
demonstrate that the altered or relocated segment will provide
equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. The
applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
to revise the documents enumerated in § 149-5B, when notified by
the local administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs
assessed by FEMA for this purpose. The applicant must also
provide assurances that the conveyance capacity of the altered or
relocated stream segment will be maintained.
(6) A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, if required
by the local administrator, which shows whether proposed
development to be located in an area of special flood hazard may
result in physical damage to any other property.
(7) In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available from
other sources, base flood elevation data shall be provided by the
permit applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed
developments (including proposals for manufactured home and
recreational vehicle parks and subdivisions) that are greater than
either 50 lots or five acres.
§ 149-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 149-11
1:139
§ 149-11. Duties of local administrator.
Duties of the local administrator shall include, but not be limited to the
following.
A. Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the
following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(1) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 149-10C, Application for a permit, and for
compliance with the provisions and standards of this chapter.
(2) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks, to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard,
all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
applicable standards of § 149-12, General standards, and, in
particular, § 149-12A, Subdivision proposals.
(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special
flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property
(e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood velocities). The local
administrator may require the applicant to submit additional
technical analyses and data necessary to complete the
determination. If the proposed development may result in physical
damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
§ 149-12, General standards, no permit shall be issued. The
applicant may revise the application to include measures that
mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit the
application.
(4) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
state or federal law.
B. Use of other flood data.
(1) When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has designated
areas of special flood hazard on the community's Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced water surface elevation
data (these areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM) nor
identified a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 149-10C(7), as criteria for requiring that
new construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meet the requirements of this chapter.
(2) When base flood elevation data are not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
§ 149-11 RAMAPO CODE § 149-11
1:140
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the purposes
of this chapter.
C. Alteration of watercourses.
(1) Notification to adjacent communities and the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submittal of evidence
of such notification to the Regional Administrator, Region II,
Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(2) Determine that the permit holder has provided for maintenance
within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
D. Construction stage.
(1) In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor or
completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially improved
structure, obtain from the permit holder a certification of the asbuilt
elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation, in
relation to mean sea level. The certificate shall be prepared by or
under the direct supervision of a licensed land surveyor or
professional engineer and certified by same. For manufactured
homes, the permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation
upon placement of the structure on the site. A certificate of
elevation must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it
remains on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is
fully licensed and ready for highway use).
(2) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval of
the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies detected
shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project unless
immediately corrected.
E. Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's engineer or
architect shall make periodic inspections at appropriate times
throughout the period of construction in order to monitor compliance
with permit conditions and enable said inspector to certify, if requested,
that the development is in compliance with the requirements of the
floodplain development permit and/or any variance provisions.

less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items
(a) through (l) in § 149-13A(4) have been fully considered. As the lot
size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
(a) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure; and
(b) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
(3) Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for
the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
(a) The criteria of § 149-13B(1), (4), (5) and (6) of this section are
met; and
(b) The structure or other development is protected by methods
that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create
no additional threat to public safety.
(4) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(6) Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification
of:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and

extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances.
(7) Notification requirements.
(a) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with
the lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given
written notice over the signature of a community official that:
[1] The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below
the base flood level will result in increased premium rates
for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100
of insurance coverage; and

risks to life and property.
(b) Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all
variance actions as required in § 149-11H of this chapter.
A. The Town Board of the Town of Ramapo has concluded a series of public
hearings held by a legislative subcommittee of said Town Board with
respect to the recent Golan Heights failure. It is apparent that there is
an inordinate exposure to loss of contract deposits and other moneys
placed with builders in connection with the construction and purchase
of homes because of the builder's financial failures. It is also apparent
that such losses have an adverse effect on the residential building
construction industry and the orderly development of the Town, which
is more fully set out in the subcommittee's findings.
B. The Town of Ramapo hereby determines that the enacting of this
chapter, pursuant to the powers granted by the Municipal Home Rule
Law and the Town Law of the State of New York, will contribute to the
public welfare and safety, to the orderly development of the Town of
Ramapo and to the protection of future home buyers in the Town of
Ramapo and reinforce public confidence in the financially responsible
builders and controls constructing homes in the Town of Ramapo.

shall deliver the deed pursuant to the written contract, the obligation of
the surety will become void, but otherwise to be firmly bound to the
purchaser for the repayment of any sums paid to the seller. Said bond
shall be unequivocal and provide for no exceptions except the default of
the purchaser and be in a form and content satisfactory to the Town
Attorney's office.

SCENIC ROAD DISTRICT
GENERAL REFERENCES
Zoning  See Ch. 376.
§ 215-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Scenic Road District
Law for the Town of Ramapo."
§ 215-2. Intent and legislative findings.
The Town Board of the Town of Ramapo wishes to preserve its historic
resources, stone walls, other natural features, and scenic views from its
roadways and other public areas by channeling new development away
from those areas and onto lands which are not as scenic and historically
significant. The view experienced from these areas contributes significantly
to the overall character of the Town, an attribute the community seeks to
preserve and enhance while accommodating growth and change. Where
development occurs in sensitive scenic areas, the Town wishes to assure
that such development is consistent with the objective of maintaining the
existing scenic character of such areas to the greatest extent practicable.
Specifically, the Town finds:
A. That the natural, open character of the Ramapo Scenic Road District is
a critical feature of the unique heritage of the Town of Ramapo whose
preservation enriches and benefits both residents and visitors;
§ 207-7 RAMAPO CODE § 215-2
1:200
§ 215-3. Establishment of district.
§ 215-4. Plan review and approval.
B. That the Ramapo Scenic Road District is characterized by historic
homes and buildings, mature trees, thick virgin woodlands or fields
which contribute to the overall scenic, historic and quality character of
the Town;
C. That it is desirable to protect panoramic views as well as sensitive
natural habitats on the Ramapo Scenic Road District; and
D. That preservation of these features while providing for appropriate
development can only be achieved by encouraging flexibility in the
design of land use and development projects.
A. In furtherance of the above legislative findings, a Scenic Road District
is hereby established which shall include all property in unincorporated
areas of the Town of Ramapo within 1,000 feet from the center line of
the following public roads: [Amended 6-29-2005 by L.L. No. 4-2005]
(1) Route 202.
(2) Sterling Mine Road.
(3) Route 17, north of the intersection with the New York State
Thruway.
(4) The entire length of the Palisades Parkway.
(5) South Mountain Road.
(6) Spook Rock Road.
(7) Johnsontown Road
(8) Camp Hill Road.
(9) Route 306 north of Grandview.
(10) Seven Lakes Drive.
B. The Scenic Road District is shown on the Town's Scenic Road District
Map.19
A. No construction or material alteration of any principal or accessory use
within the Scenic Road District is permitted unless said use shall have
obtained approval as set forth below.
(1) If it is determined that the use is subject to site development plan
approval, such use shall receive plan approval from the Planning
Board together with the site development plan approval in
19.Editor's Note: Said map is on file in the office of Building, Planning and Zoning.
§ 215-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 215-4

conformity with the regulations set forth below in Subsection A(3)
and (4).
(2) All other uses shall be subject to review and approval by the
Building Inspector. The Building Inspector shall issue a building
permit upon a determination of compliance with the regulation set
forth below in Subsection A(3) and (4), and other applicable zoning
and building code requirements.
(3) Review standards. In order to grant approval, the Building
Inspector or Planning Board, whichever is applicable, must find
that the important scenic and natural features of the site will be
substantially preserved and, except for structures subject to
Architectural Review pursuant to Article X of the Town's Zoning
Law, that such structure or alteration is architecturally compatible
with surrounding structures. To the extent practicable, all
structures to be built on land within the Ramapo Scenic Road
District shall be sited and clustered on the tract in such a way as to
avoid or minimize the obstructing of scenic views in this district.
[Amended 2-11-2015 by L.L. No. 1-2015]
(4) Additional standards of review. The additional regulations set forth
below supplement, but do not replace, the use and bulk regulations
otherwise applicable to the underlying zoning districts.
(a) The minimum front setback requirement, as set forth for the
applicable underlying zoning district, may be doubled for all
structures and parking areas located within the Ramapo
Scenic Road District. The side and rear yard setbacks may also
be doubled by the Planning Board if there are historic or scenic
resources which are to be protected.
(b) The Building Inspector or Planning Board, whichever is
applicable, may require that the front yard shall be managed
by the property owner in a way that preserves significant
existing vegetation, plant specimens, landforms and water
features; nurtures tree planting and other natural landscaping
efforts; creates dense landscaping buffers; preserves stone
walls, existing fields and similar features; and/or ensures both
the protection of visual buffers and the prominence of key
scenic vistas, including views of historic properties and
landscapes.
(c) Any necessary intrusions within the open space area shall be
reduced to the extent practicable by such measures as
common driveways and shared utility services for building
sites that may gain access from the roadways in the Ramapo
Scenic Road District.
(d) Cluster subdivisions in accordance with the Town Law of the
State of New York shall be the preferred residential land
§ 215-4 RAMAPO CODE § 215-4
1:202
development technique for lands within, adjacent to or
affecting the overall character of a Ramapo Scenic Road
District, provided that:
[1] All structures and/or parking areas are effectively
screened on a year-round basis by existing landform and/
or vegetation or by substantial new planting and berming
as viewed from the public right-of-way, provided that such
treatment does not diminish the prominence of key scenic
vistas including views of historic properties and
landscapes.
[2] A conservation easement, satisfactory to the approving
authority, is granted by the landowner to the Town, a land
trust or similarly qualified entity to ensure that the
screening will be properly maintained and managed or a
similarly binding mechanism as acceptable to the Town
Attorney shall be provided.
(e) Existing vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent
possible. Every attempt shall be made to limit cutting so as to
maintain native vegetation as a screen for structures as seen
from road, parks and other public views within the Ramapo
Scenic Road District.
(f) No cutting of trees exceeding eight inches in diameter
(measured at a height of four feet off the ground) shall be
permitted except in accordance with an approved building
permit, site plan, subdivision or timber harvesting plan. In
RR-160, RR-80, RR-50, R-40, R-40A, R-35, R-25, R-15, R-15A
and R-15C Zoning Districts, cutting all trees in a single
contiguous area exceeding 20,000 square feet shall be
prohibited, however, this restriction shall not apply: 1) to
roadways, drainage structures and utility easements in an
approved subdivision; or 2) in subdivisions which have been
subject to review by means of an environmental impact
statement pursuant to the New York State Environmental
Quality Review Act. Where the tree cutting restriction is
applicable, the Planning Board may grant a waiver from this
restriction upon a finding that there are unique characteristics
to the property or other factors creating an undue hardship,
provided the Planning Board makes a specific finding that the
objectives of the Scenic Road District Law are nonetheless
substantially satisfied. In all other zoning districts, cutting all
trees in a single contiguous area exceeding 20,000 square feet
may be permitted in accordance with an approved site plan.
[Amended 5-13-2013 by L.L. No. 2-2013]
(g) Throughout the Ramapo Scenic Road District
telecommunication towers shall be discouraged. In all cases
the Town shall encourage shared use of towers rather than

power, right and authority to issue an appearance ticket, as the same is

York, for the violation of any section of this chapter. In addition, the Town
of Ramapo may institute an appropriate action or proceeding in any court
of competent jurisdiction pursuant to § 268 of the Town Law of the State of
New York.
§ 215-6. Penalties for offenses.
Any person violating any section or provision of this chapter shall be guilty
of a Class 3 violation as defined in Chapter 1, General Provisions, Article
II, Penalties, of the Code of the Town of Ramapo, and shall be punished
according to the provisions thereunder.
§ 215-7. Review of decision.

permit pursuant to this chapter, such decision shall be reviewable by appeal
to the Board of Appeals from the Building Inspector's decision. The appeal

SPDES (STATE POLLUTANT DISCHARGE ELIMINATION SYSTEM)
STORMWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT  A permit issued by the NYS DEC
that authorizes the discharge of pollutants to waters of the state.
SPECIAL CONDITIONS 
STORMWATER  Rainwater, snowmelt, drainage and uncontaminated
groundwater.
303(d) LIST  A list of all surface waters in the state for which beneficial
uses of the water (drinking, recreation, aquatic habitat, and industrial
use) are impaired by pollutants, prepared periodically by the New York
State Department of Environmental Conservation as required by Section
303(d) of the Clean Water Act; 303(d) listed waters are estuaries, lakes and
streams that fall short of state surface water quality standards and are not
expected to improve within the next two years.
DISCHARGE COMPLIANCE WITH WATER QUALITY STANDARDS 
The condition that applies where a municipality has been notified by
NYS DEC that the discharge of stormwater authorized under its MS4
permit may have caused or has the reasonable potential to cause or
contribute to the violation of an applicable water quality standard.
Under this condition the municipality must take all necessary actions
to ensure future discharges do not cause or contribute to a violation of
water quality standards.
A.
LISTED WATERS  TERS  The condition in the municipality's MS4
permit that applies where the MS4 discharges to a 303(d) listed water.
Under this condition the stormwater management program must
ensure no increase of the listed pollutant of concern to the 303(d) listed
water.
B.
TMDL (TOTAL MAXIMUM DAILY LOAD) STRATEGY 
The condition in the municipality's MS4 permit where a TMDL,
including requirements for control of stormwater discharges, has
been approved by the EPA for a water body or watershed into
which the MS4 discharges. If the discharge from the MS4 did
not meet the TMDL stormwater allocations prior to September
10, 2003, the municipality was required to modify its stormwater
management program to ensure that reduction of the pollutant of
concern specified in the TMDL is achieved.
(1)
The condition in the municipality's MS4 permit that applies if a
TMDL is approved in the future by the EPA for any water body or
watershed into which an MS4 discharges. Under this condition the
municipality must review the applicable TMDL to see if it includes
requirements for control of stormwater discharges. If an MS4 is not
meeting the TMDL stormwater allocations, the municipality must,
within six months of the TMDL's approval, modify its stormwater
management program to ensure that reduction of the pollutant of
concern specified in the TMDL is achieved.
(2)
C.
§ 218-34 RAMAPO CODE § 218-34
1:234

authorization.
A. Best management practices. Where the SMO has identified illicit
discharges as defined in § 218-34 or activities contaminating
stormwater as defined in § 218-38, the municipality may require
implementation of best management practices (BMPs) to control those
illicit discharges and activities.
(1) The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment
shall provide, at its own expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into
the MS4 through the use of structural and nonstructural BMPs and
shall keep and maintain records and logs of the inspection and
maintenance of the BMPs and make available for inspection by the
MS4 for a period of three years.
(2) Any person responsible for a property which is, or may be, the
source of an illicit discharge or an activity contaminating
stormwater as defined in § 218-38 may be required to implement,
at said person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural
BMPs to reduce or eliminate the source of the pollutant(s) to the
MS4, including the recordkeeping requirements described in
Subsection A(1).
(3) Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid SPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with
the provisions of this section.
B. Individual sewage treatment systems; response to special conditions
requiring no increase of pollutants or requiring a reduction of
pollutants. Where individual sewage treatment systems are
contributing to the municipality's being subject to the special
conditions as defined in § 218-34 of this article, the owner or operator
of such individual sewage treatment systems shall be required to:
(1) Maintain and operate individual sewage treatment systems as
follows:
(a) Inspect the septic tank annually to determine scum and sludge

§ 218-40. Suspension of access to MS4; illicit discharges in
emergency situations.
the outlet baffle or sanitary tee or the top of the sludge is
within 10 inches of the bottom of the outlet baffle or sanitary
tee. Most tanks should be pumped out every two to three years.
However, pumping may be more or less frequent depending
on use. Inspection of the tank for cracks, leaks and blockages
should be done by the septage hauler at the time of pumping
of the tank contents.
(b) Avoid the use of septic tank additives.
(c) Avoid the disposal of excessive quantities of detergents,
kitchen wastes (including oil and grease), laundry wastes, and
household chemicals.

design professional to the municipality at the completion of
construction of the repair or replacement system. A written
certificate of approval shall be issued by the Rockland County
Health Department after inspection of the construction of the
repair or replacement system.
A. If it is necessary for the SMO to take action, the SMO may, without prior
notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4. The
SMO shall notify the person of such suspension within a reasonable
time thereafter in writing of the reasons for the suspension. If the
person fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency,
§ 218-39 RAMAPO CODE § 218-40
1:238
§ 218-41. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity SPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit shall be required by the
municipality in a form acceptable to the NYS DEC prior to the allowing of
discharges to the MS4.
§ 218-42. Access and monitoring of discharges.
the SMO may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize damage to the MS4 or to minimize danger to persons. All
costs and expenses incurred by the SMO to remedy the situation,
including proper disposal, shall be assessed to the owner of the
property. If the property owner fails to pay same, it may become a lien
against the property, subject to a hearing a minimum of 10 days prior
to the imposition of the tax lien.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the municipality's MS4 in violation of this article may
have his MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or
reduce an illicit discharge. The SMO will notify such person in writing
of the proposed termination of its MS4 access and the reasons therefor.
The person may petition the SMO for a reconsideration and hearing.
Access may be granted by the SMO if he/she finds that the illicit
discharge has ceased and the person has taken steps to prevent its
recurrence. Access may be denied if the SMO determines in writing
that the illicit discharge has not ceased or is likely to recur. A person
commits a violation if the person reinstates MS4 access to property
terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the
SMO.
A. The SMO or his/her designee shall be permitted to enter and inspect all
properties subject to regulation under this article as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a person has
security measures in force that require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the person shall make the
necessary arrangements to allow access to the SMO.
B. All persons shall allow the SMO ready access to all parts of the property
for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of
records as may be required to implement this article.

article to install monitoring equipment as is reasonably necessary to
determine compliance with this article. The property's sampling and
§ 218-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 218-42
1:239
§ 218-43. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a property or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a property or operation, has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies, the municipality,
and the responsible MS4 of the occurrence via emergency dispatch
services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person
shall notify the municipality and responsible MS4 in person or by telephone
or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or
by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to
the municipality within three business days of the telephone notice. If the
discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial
establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain
an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent
its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
§ 218-44. Notice of violation; penalties for offenses.
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition by the person at his own expense. All
devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be
calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
E. Unreasonable delay in allowing the municipality access to a property
subject to this article is a violation of this article. A person who is the
operator of a property subject to this article commits an offense if the
person denies the municipality reasonable access to the property for
the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this
article.
F. If the SMO has been refused access to any part of the property from
which stormwater is discharged and he/she is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with
this article or any order issued hereunder, then the SMO may seek
issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
A. Notice of violation. When the municipality's SMO finds that a person
has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this article,
the SMO may order compliance by written notice of violation by
certified mail and/or posting of the property to the responsible person.
(1) Such notice may require, without limitation:
(a) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;

required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall
further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore
within the established deadline, the work will be done by a
designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense
thereof shall be charged to the violator.
(3) The municipality shall also have the right to issue an appearance
ticket for said violation.
B. Penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided
herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this article
shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000
or imprisonment for a period not to exceed 15 days, or both for
conviction of a first offense; for conviction of a second offense both of
which were committed within a period of five years, punishable by a
fine not less than $1,000 nor more than $2,500 or imprisonment for a

1:241
§ 218-47. Injunctive relief.
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply
with any of the requirements of this article. If a person has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this article, the SMO may petition for
a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities
which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform
abatement or remediation of the violation.
§ 218-48. Alternative remedies.
A. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the notice of violation or, in the event of an appeal, within five
business days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the
decision of the SMO, then the SMO may request the person's
permission for access to the subject property to take any and all
measures reasonably necessary to abate the violation and/or restore
the property. The cost of implementing and maintaining such measures
shall be the sole responsibility of the person.
B. If refused access to the subject property, the SMO may seek a warrant
in a court of competent jurisdiction to be authorized to enter upon the
property to take any and all measures reasonably necessary to abate
the violation and/or restore the property. The cost of implementing and
maintaining such measures shall be the sole responsibility of the
person.

It is the intention of the Town Board of the Town of Ramapo, by the adoption
of this article, to regulate the posting and display of political and other
temporary signs on property within the unincorporated area of the Town
of Ramapo in pursuance of and for the purpose of securing and protecting
the public health, comfort, convenience, safety and welfare and preserving
the peace, good order and physical appearance of the Town of Ramapo and
its inhabitants. The Town Board finds that the streets, highways and other
areas of the Town are becoming increasingly cluttered with political and
other types of signs which are interfering with the natural beauty and traffic
safety of the Town. The substantial possibility exists of a proliferation of
such signs in the Town over extended periods of time with the attendant
problems with pedestrian and vehicular traffic safety, litter, structural and
other hazards. It is the purpose of this article to protect the general public
from the hazards of flying paper or cloth, general debris and litter and the
destruction of, or injury to, property and property rights.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 237-1. Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
§ 237-2. Purpose and objectives.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the
general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing within this
jurisdiction and to address the findings of fact in § 237-1 hereof. This
chapter seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives:
A. Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious
cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and
increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition.
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of
waterborne pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and
other desirable species.
C. Clearing and grading during construction tend to increase soil erosion
and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat.
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby
increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation.
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow.
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on
the waters of the municipality.
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from land development activities.
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the
public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety.
I. Regulation of land development activities by means of performance
standards governing stormwater management and site design will
produce development compatible with the natural functions of a
particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse
effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.
§ 237-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 237-2
1:271
§ 237-3. Statutory authority.
This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authority granted by § 10 of the
Municipal Home Rule Law of the State of New York.
§ 237-4. Applicability.
A. Meet the requirements of minimum measures 4 and 5 of the New York
State Department of Environmental Conservation State Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) General Permit for Stormwater
Discharges from Municipal Separate Stormwater Sewer Systems
(MS4s), Permit No. GP-02-02, or as amended or revised;
B. Require land development activities to conform to the substantive
requirements of the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation
State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) General Permit
for Construction Activities GP-02-01, or as amended or revised;
C. Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development
activities in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream
temperature, and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of
stream channels;
D. Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land
development activities which would otherwise degrade local water
quality;
E. Minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows
from any specific site during and following development to the
maximum extent practicable; and
F. Reduce stormwater runoff rates, volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint
source pollution wherever possible through stormwater management
practices and ensure that these management practices are properly
maintained and eliminate threats to public safety.
A. This chapter shall be applicable to all land development activities as
defined in this chapter.
B. The Town of Ramapo has designated a Stormwater Management Officer
who shall accept and review all stormwater pollution prevention plans
and forward such plans to the applicable municipal board. The
Stormwater Management Officer may:
(1) Review the plans;
(2) Upon approval by the Town Board of the Town of Ramapo, engage
the services of a registered professional engineer to review the
plans, specifications and related documents at a cost not to exceed
a fee schedule established by said governing board; or
(3) Accept the certification of a licensed professional that the plans
conform to the requirements of this chapter.

Except as hereinafter provided, it shall be unlawful for any person, firm,
entity or corporation to:
A. The rapid growth in the Town of Ramapo and consequent improvement
and construction of buildings, paved surfaces, roads and other
improvements has altered in the past and continues to alter the natural
flow of surface waters on the land which, together with the construction
of culverts, drains and ditches for the carrying off of surface water, has
both increased the quantity of storm and surface drainage and
amplified in quantity and intensity the extent of runoff and surface flow,
thus leading to present and potential flooding of property and homes,
soil erosion, danger to health, injury and destruction of property. The
development of appropriate facilities to meet the needs of the
community has been inadequate, with the consequent result that a
serious problem and danger has arisen to the health, welfare, wellbeing
and property in the Town of Ramapo. It is the intention of the
Town Board to protect the citizens of the Town of Ramapo, to prevent
the dangers arising from improper drainage, improper drainage
facilities in areas of poor drainage and high groundwater, inadequate
construction of drainage facilities and unwise diversion, use and
obstruction of streams and watercourses and to plan for the present
and future use of drainage systems and watercourses. [Amended
6-14-1972 by L.L. No. 3-1972]
B. The provisions of this chapter shall be applicable to those portions of
the Town of Ramapo outside the limits of any incorporated village.
A. Place, deposit or permit to be placed or deposited any debris, fill, sand,
stone or other solid materials of any kind or nature or construction of
any kind into or across any stream, pond, ditch, culvert, pipe,
watercourse or other drainage system, whether artificial or natural,
shown on the Official Map of the Town of Ramapo.

L.L. No. 3-1972]
Except as hereinafter provided, all existing obstructions, dams, diversions,
construction of any kind, deposits of debris, fill, sand, stone or other solid
materials or other alterations or diversions of the natural flow of water or
the intensity or quantity of flow through, across or to any stream, pond,
ditch, culvert, watercourse or other drainage system shown on the Official
Map of the Town of Ramapo which causes the inundation of real property
and/or buildings on other premises; or in the determination of the Town
Engineer constitutes an undue burden upon or hampers the proper present
or future course of development of the aforesaid drainage system; or in
the determination of the Town Engineer presently constitutes or in the
reasonably foreseeable future will constitute a danger or hazard to the wellbeing,
safety or general welfare of the residents of the Town or any property
located therein shall be removed or corrected by the owners of the premises
upon which said obstructions, dams, diversions, construction, deposits or
other alterations of the natural flow of water are situated, within a period to
be set by the Town Engineer, not to exceed 60 days after written notice to
remove or correct the same from the Town Board.
§ 240-4. Permitted acts.
B. Construct and/or place any ditch, pipe, culvert or artificial watercourse
of any kind or nature which shall collect and direct the flow of natural
surface waters or drainage or increase in intensity or quantity the flow
of surface waters or drainage from paved surfaces, structures, roads or
improvements directly into any stream, pond, ditch, culvert, pipe or
watercourse or other drainage system shown on the Official Map of the
Town of Ramapo.
C. Fill, obstruct, dam, divert or otherwise change or alter the natural or
artificial flow of waters or drainage or the intensity or quantity of flow
through any stream, ditch, pipe, pond, culvert, watercourse or other
improvement or drainage system shown on the Official Map of the Town
of Ramapo.
A. The prohibited acts and correction of existing conditions set forth in
§§ 240-2 and 240-3 hereof shall have no application to work done
pursuant to the authority of an agency of the Town of Ramapo, County
of Rockland, State of New York and/or United States of America.
B. The acts set forth in § 240-2 hereof are permissible if done pursuant to
the terms and conditions of a permit obtained from the Director of
Building, Planning and Zoning of the Town of Ramapo or pursuant to an
approved and filed subdivision map or a building permit or special
permit carrying site development plan approval by the Planning Board.

shown on the Official Map of the Town of Ramapo, except an applicant
filing a proposed subdivision with the Planning Board, shall present
plans and specifications prepared by a licensed professional engineer
for the proposed change to the Town Engineer. However, where, in the
opinion of the Town Engineer, the cost of the proposed improvement
does not exceed the sum of $100, the plans and specifications do not
have to be prepared by a licensed professional engineer. Wherever an
application for a permit to do an act as set forth above affects land lying
partly within and partly without lands requiring subdivision approval or
site development plan approval, an application for a permit for that part
of the premises lying outside of the subdivision or outside of the land
requiring site plan approval shall be submitted to the Town Engineer.
[Amended 2-6-2012 by L.L. No. 2-2012]
B. Within 45 days after receipt of an applicant's proposed plans and
specifications, the Town Engineer shall communicate his determination
to the applicant and, if the changes are approved, issue a permit
therefor.
C. Wherever the approval of the Town Engineer shall, in the opinion of the
Town Engineer, affect or require a change or addition to the Official
Map, the Town Engineer shall, prior to the issuance of any permit, place
the matter on the agenda of the Town Board for a public hearing. At
least 10 days' notice of a public hearing on the proposed action with
reference to the change in the Official Map shall be published in the
official newspaper of the Town. Prior to making any such addition or

Senior Citizen Tax Exemption
[Adopted 3-28-1979 by L.L. No. 2-1979 as Ch. 299 of the 1979 Code]
§ 253-1. Legislative intent. [Amended 10-26-1983 by L.L. No.
13-1983; 1-24-1990 by L.L. No. 1-1990]
The Town Board of the Town of Ramapo, being ever mindful of its
responsibility and obligation to provide for the welfare and financial
independence of the senior citizens of this Town who have made a vital
contribution to the growth, development and progress of our community,
intends by the enactment of this article to provide protection for the elderly
limited-income homeowner from the increased cost of living. The purpose
of this article is to grant a partial exemption from taxation in accordance
with a graduated schedule, as provided for in § 467 of the Real Property Tax
Law, for real property which is owned by said persons with limited income
who are 65 years of age or over and who meet the requirements set forth in
§ 467 of the Real Property Tax Law.
§ 253-2. Grant of exemption. [Amended 10-26-1983 by L.L. No.
13-1983; 1-24-1990 by L.L. No. 1-1990]
All real property owned by persons 65 years of age or over shall be exempt
from Town of Ramapo taxes in accordance with a graduated schedule, as
provided for in § 467 of the Real Property Tax Law, provided also that the
requirements set forth in § 253-3 below are complied with.
§ 253-3. Qualifications for exemption.
In order to qualify for an exemption, the following requirements must be
met:
A. All of the owners of real property must be 65 years of age or over on the
date the application is filed. However, where said property is owned
jointly by a husband and wife, only one spouse must be 65 years of age
or over on the date of filing the application. Any person otherwise
qualifying under this section shall not be denied an exemption if he
becomes 65 years of age after taxable status date and before December
31 of the same year. [Amended 1-24-1990 by L.L. No. 1-1990]
B. Title to the property shall have been vested in the owner of the property
or, if more than one, in all of the owners, for at least 24 consecutive
months prior to the date the application is filed; provided, however, that
in the event of the death of either a husband or wife in whose name title
of property shall have been vested at the time of death and then
becomes vested solely in the survivor by virtue of devise by or descent
from the deceased husband or wife, the time of ownership of the
property by the deceased husband or wife shall be deemed also a time
of ownership by the survivor, and such ownership shall be deemed
continuous for the purposes of computing such period of 24 months,
§ 253-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 253-3
1:311
provided further that in the event of a transfer by either a husband
or wife to the other spouse of all or part of the title to the property,
the time of ownership of the property by the transferor spouse shall be
deemed also a time of ownership by the transferee spouse, and such
ownership shall be deemed continuous for the purposes of computing
such period of 24 months, and provided further that where property of
the owner or owners has been acquired to replace property formerly
owned by such owner or owners and taken by eminent domain or other
involuntary proceeding, except a tax sale, and further provided that
where a residence is sold and replaced with another within one year
and is in the same assessment unit, the period of ownership of the
former property shall be combined with the period of ownership of the
property for which application is made for exemption, and such periods
of ownership shall be deemed to be consecutive for purposes of this
section.
C. The property must be used exclusively for residential purposes and
occupied in whole or in part by the owner or owners and constitute the
legal residence of the owner or owners.
D. Pursuant to § 467 of the Real Property Tax Law, the percentage of the
assessed valuation of real property which is exempt from taxation will
be determined on the basis of annual income in accordance with the
graduated schedule set forth below. "Annual income" refers to the
income of the owner or the combined income of all of the owners for the
income tax year immediately preceding the date that the application is
filed. Where title of the property is vested in either a husband or wife,
annual income is the combined income of the husband and wife. In
computing net rental income or net income from self-employment, no
depreciation deduction shall be allowed for the exhaustion, wear and
tear of real or personal property held for the production of income.
Such income shall include social security and retirement benefits,
interest, dividends, total gains from sale or exchange of a capital asset
in the same tax year, net rental income, salary or earnings, and net
income from self-employment but shall not include a return of capital,
gifts or inheritances received during the twelve-month period and
medical and prescription drug expenses that are not reimbursed or paid
by insurance. Veteran's disability compensation shall not be included in
the calculation of income limits for the partial tax exemption contained
in § 467 of the Real Property Tax Law. [Last amended 2-25-2009 by

E. Ownership is limited to dwellings with three or fewer dwelling units or
ownership of a single dwelling unit where title is vested in the owner in
a dwelling containing four or more dwelling units and the dwelling unit
is separately assessed to the individual owner or owners and to trailers
or mobile homes which are separately assessed to the owner or owners
of the property. Exemptions are not available to corporations, to
persons leasing property or to an owner or owners of property with an
interest less than a life estate or to cooperative ownership where title is
held by a corporation.
A. In the event the owner, or all of the owners, of property which has
received an exemption pursuant to § 467 oft the Real Property Tax Law
on the preceding assessment roll fail to file the application pursuant to
§ 467 on or before the taxable status date, such owner or owners may
file the application, executed as if such application had been filed

such person, a sworn affidavit on forms prescribed by the State Board
of Real Property Services must be included with such payment which
shall state that such person continues to be eligible for such exemption.

A. Legislative intent. The Real Property Tax Law provides senior citizens
owning "qualifying real property" with a tax exemption. The scope of
"qualifying residential real property" did not include cooperative
apartments owned by senior citizens. Section 467 of the Real Property
Tax Law has been amended to permit towns, by adoption of a local law,
to include cooperative housing within the meaning of "qualifying
residential real property."
B. Eligible property. Pursuant to § 467 of the Real Property Tax Law, the
percentage of cooperative shares owned by senior citizens in a
cooperative apartment corporation shall be eligible to be included in
"qualifying residential real property" for the purposes of determining
eligibility for a senior citizen's real property tax exemption.

Real Property Tax Limitation
[Adopted 10-6-1981 by L.L. No. 4-1981]
§ 253-9. Legislative intent.
§ 253-10. Tax limitation.
Hereafter, in the Town of Ramapo, the amount of taxes to be raised by the
General Fund, the Part-Town Fund and the Part-Town Police Fund in any
fiscal year, in addition to providing for the interest on and the principal of all
indebtedness, shall not exceed an amount equal to 8/10 of 1% of the average
full valuation of taxable real estate in the Town, based on a prior five-year
average, less the amount to be raised by tax on real estate in such year
for the payment of the interest on and redemption of certificates or other
evidence of indebtedness described in Subdivisions A and D of § 5 of Article
VIII of the Constitution of the State of New York, or renewals thereof.
§ 253-11. Determination of average full valuation.
The average full valuation of taxable real estate of the Town shall be
determined by taking the assessed valuations of taxable real estate on the
last completed assessment roll and the four preceding rolls of the Town and
applying thereto the ratio which such assessed valuation on each of such
rolls bears to the full valuation, as determined by the State Tax Commission
or by such other state officer or agency as the Legislature shall by law
direct. The Legislature shall prescribe the manner by which such ratio shall
be determined by the State Tax Commission or by such other state officer
or agency.
A. In recent years, the real property tax burden on residents of suburban
towns, such as the Town of Ramapo, has approached confiscatory
levels. This is due to the imposition of taxes at various levels of local
government, i.e., county, village, town and school district. Should
present trends continue unchanged, projections indicate no substantial
relief in this regard. Article VIII, § 10, of the Constitution of the State of
New York imposes specific limitations on the amounts which counties,
cities, villages and certain school districts may raise by levies upon real
property. However, towns and central school districts have never been
included in such constitutional provisions, except for debt limitations.
B. The Town of Ramapo believes that the time has come to adopt
restrictions on a town's taxing authority, such as those provided by
Article VIII, § 10, of the State Constitution for other levels of local
government. Therefore, it is the intent of this article to establish a tax
limitation on the Town tax in the Town of Ramapo. It is believed that no
local government should have an unlimited power to tax and that all
local governments should be included within constitutional provisions.
This article is Ramapo's contribution to such an effort.

[Adopted 11-12-1997 by L.L. No. 9-1997]
§ 253-25. Legislative intent.
The Real Property Tax Law provides veterans owning qualifying real
property with a tax exemption. The scope of "qualifying residential real
property" did not include cooperative apartments owned by veterans.
Section 458 of the Real Property Tax Law has been amended to permit
towns, by adoption of a local law, to include cooperative housing within the
meaning of "qualifying residential real property."
§ 253-26. Eligible property.
Pursuant to § 458 of the Real Property Tax Law, the percentage of
cooperative shares owned by veterans in a cooperative apartment
corporation shall be eligible to be included in "qualifying residential real

property tax exemption.

Converted Condominium Units
[Adopted 2-11-1998 by L.L. No. 2-1998]
§ 253-27. Legislative intent.
Condominium units presently receive a beneficial real property tax
assessment pursuant to Real Property Law § 339-y and Real Property Tax
Law § 581. Under the provisions, the aggregate assessment of their units
plus common interests cannot exceed the total valuation of the property
assessed as a parcel. Based on these provisions, condominium units often
pay less property taxes than other real property of similar value. This
has created a situation where certain people are converting property into
condominium ownership to receive the preferential treatment under the
law. Pursuant to an amendment of §§ 581 and 339-y, the Town can, by
local law, provide that the provisions of § 581, Subdivision 1(a), and § 339-y,
Subdivision 1(b) shall not apply to a converted condominium units within
the Town.
§ 253-28. Definition.
For the purposes of this article, a converted condominium unit shall mean
a dwelling unit held in condominium form of ownership that has previously
been on an assessment roll as a dwelling unit in other than condominium
form of ownership and has not been previously subjected to the provisions
of §§ 581 of the Real Property Tax Law and 339-y of the Real Property Law.
§ 253-29. Application.
The provisions of § 581, Subdivision 1(a), of the Real Property Tax Law and
§ 339-y, Subdivision 1(b), of the Real Property Law shall not apply to any
converted condominium unit within the Town of Ramapo.

and whose income is limited by reason of such disability may be partially
exempt from taxation provided the Town, by local law, grants the partial
exemption. Such partial exemption shall be subject to the income limits
established by § 459-c of the Real Property Tax Law.

§ 253-42. Legislative intent.

indicated:

than active duty for training.

Law 105-85, the 1998 National Defense Authorization Act.
LATEST STATE EQUALIZATION RATE  The latest final state equalization
rate or special equalization rate established by the commissioner pursuant
to Article 12 of the Real Property Tax Law. The commissioner shall establish
a special equalization rate if it finds that there has been a material change
in the level of assessment since the establishment of the latest state
equalization rate, but in no event shall such special equalization rate exceed
100. In the event that the state equalization rate exceeds 100, then the
state equalization rate shall be 100 for the purposes of this article. Where
a special equalization rate is established for purposes of this article, the
assessor is directed and authorized to recompute the Cold War veterans
exemption on the assessment roll by applying such special equalization rate
instead of state equalization rate applied in the previous year and to make
the appropriate corrections on the assessment roll, notwithstanding the
fact that such assessor may receive the special equalization rate after the
completion, verification and filing of such final assessment roll. In the event
that the assessor does not have custody of the roll when such recomputation
is accomplished, the assessor shall certify such recomputation to the local
officers having custody and control of such roll, and such local officers are
hereby directed and authorized to enter the computed Cold War veterans
exemption certified by the assessor on such roll.

1:339
for use in a special assessing unit as defined in § 1801 of the Real Property
Tax Law.
QUALIFIED OWNER  A Cold War veteran, the spouse of a Cold War
veteran, or the unremarried surviving spouse of a deceased Cold War
veteran. Where property is owned by more than one qualified owner, the
exemption to which each is entitled may be combined. Where a veteran is
also the unremarried surviving spouse of a veteran, such person may also
receive any exemption to which the deceased spouse was entitled.
QUALIFIED RESIDENTIAL REAL PROPERTY  Property owned by a
qualified owner which is used exclusively for residential purposes; provided,
however, that in the event that any portion of such property is not used
exclusively for residential purposes, but is used for other purposes, such
portion shall be subject to the exemption provided by this section. Such
property shall be the primary residence of the Cold War veteran or the
unremarried surviving spouse of a Cold War veteran; unless the Cold War
veteran or unremarried surviving spouse is absent from the property due to
medical reasons or institutionalization for up to five years.

where the Cold War veteran received a compensation rating from the
United States Veterans Affairs or from the United States Department of
Defense because of a service-connected disability, qualifying residential
real property shall be exempt from taxation to the extent of the product
of the assessed value of such property, multiplied by 50% of the Cold
War veteran disability rating; provided, however, that such exemption
shall not exceed $40,000, or the product of $40,000 multiplied by the
latest state equalization rate for the assessing unit.
C. If a Cold War veteran received the exemption under § 458 or 458-a of
the Real Property Tax Law, the Cold War veteran shall not be eligible to
receive the exemption under this section.
D. The exemption provided by Subsection A of this section shall be granted
for a period of 10 years. The commencement of such ten-year period
shall be governed pursuant to this subsection. Where a qualified owner
owns qualifying residential real property on the effective date of this
§ 253-43 RAMAPO CODE § 253-44
1:340
article, such ten-year period shall be measured from the assessment
roll prepared pursuant to the first taxable status date occurring on or
after the effective date of this article. Where a qualified owner does
not own qualifying residential real property on the effective date of this
article, such ten-year period shall be measured from the assessment
roll prepared pursuant to the first taxable status date occurring at

Filing Requirements for Income-Producing Properties
[Adopted 12-15-2009 by L.L. No. 3-2009]
§ 253-45. Findings; authority.
It is hereby found and declared by the Town Board of the Town of Ramapo
that assessments of all real property should be fair and uniform and that
it is the right of property owners of income-producing property to have
fair and equitable assessments. The Town Board further recognizes that the
valuation of income-producing property is often made by a capitalization
of income approach to market value and, therefore, the Assessor requires
income and expense statements from owners of said income-producing
property in order to properly evaluate the assessments. Finally, the Town
Board recognizes that owners of income-producing property enjoy certain
privacy rights in connection with income and expense statements filed with
the Assessor. This article is pursuant to the authority of Article 2, § 10,
Subdivision 1(ii)d(3) of the Municipal Home Rule Law of the State of New
York.
§ 253-46. Filing of annual income and expense statements for
income-producing property.
A. Income and expense statements. Where real property is incomeproducing
property, the owner shall be required to submit annually to
the Assessor, not later than the first of March 2010 for those statements
due in 2010 and not later than the first day of July on all succeeding
years, a statement of all income derived from all expenses attributed to
the operation of such property as follows:
(1) Where the owner's books and records reflecting the operation of
the property are maintained on a calendar-year basis, the
statement shall be for the calendar year preceding the date the
statement shall be filed.
(2) Where the owner's books and records reflecting the operation of
the property are maintained on a fiscal-year basis for federal
income tax purposes, the statement shall be for the last fiscal year
concluded as of the first day of January preceding the date the
statement shall be filed.
(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection A(1) and (2) of this
section, where the owner of the property has not operated the
property and is without knowledge of the income and expenses of
the operation of the property for a consecutive twelve-month
period concluded as of the first day of January preceding the date
the statement shall be filed, then the statement shall be for the
period of ownership.
§ 253-45 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 253-46
1:343
(4) The Assessor may for good cause shown extend the time for filing
an income and expense statement by a period not to exceed 30
days.
B. Declaration. Such statements shall contain the following declaration: "I
certify that all information contained in this statement is true and
correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. I understand that the
willful making of any false statement of material herein will subject me
to the provisions of law relevant to the making and filing of false
instruments and will render this statement null and void."
C. Form. The form on which such statement shall be submitted shall be
prepared by the Assessor and copies of such form shall be made
available at said Assessor's office in the Town of Ramapo.
D. Failure to file statement; penalties; enforcement procedures.
(1) In the event that an owner of income-producing property fails to file
an income and expense statement within the time prescribed in
Subsection A of the section (including any extension of time for
filing), the Board of Assessment Review shall deny any complaint
filed in relation to the assessment of such owner's property for said
year.
(2) In the event that an income and expense statement required under
the provisions of this section has not been timely filed, the Assessor
may compel by subpoena a production of the books and records of
the owner relevant to the income and expenses of the property and
may also make application to any court of competent jurisdiction
for an order compelling the owner to furnish the required income
and expense statement and the books and records to the income
expenses of the property. In the event that such a order is issued,
the Assessor shall be entitled to recover from the owner the costs
and expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by the Town in
connection with the proceeding to obtain and enforce the order.
E. Definition of "income-producing property." As used in this section, the
term "income producing property" means property owned for the
purpose of securing an income from the property itself, but shall not
include residential property containing three or fewer dwelling units or
property classified in Class one as defined in Article 18 of the Real
Property Tax Law.
F. Penalties for disclosure of information. Except in accordance with
proper judicial order or as otherwise provided by law, it shall be
unlawful for the Assessor, or any official or employee of the Town, any
member of the Board of Assessment Review, any person engaged or
retained by the Town, or any person who, pursuant to this section, is
permitted to inspect any income and/or expense statement or to whom
a copy, an abstract or a portion of any such statement is furnished, to
divulge or make known in any manner the amount of income and/or
expense or any particulars set forth or disclosed in any such statement
§ 253-46 RAMAPO CODE § 253-46
1:344
required under this section. The officers charged with custody of such
statements shall not be required to produce any income and expense
statement or evidence of anything contained in said statement in any
action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the Town or
Assessor. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to
an owner or his duly authorized representative of a certified copy of any
statement filed by such owner pursuant to this section or to prohibit
the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification
of particular statements and the items thereof, or delivery of a copy
to a legal representative or other professional retained by the Town or
Board of Assessment Review retained with respect to a proceeding to
review said assessment and for no other purpose. Any violation of the
provisions of this subsection shall be punished by a fine not exceeding
$1,000 or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both, at the
discretion of the court, and if the offender is an officer or employee of
the Town or member of the Board of Assessment Review, the offender
shall be dismissed from office upon compliance with the Civil Service
Law and/or all applicable laws.

Tax Exemption for Gold Star Parents
[Adopted 2-20-2014 by L.L. No. 2-2014]
§ 253-47. Legislative intent.
Pursuant to § 458-a of the Real Property Tax Law, a Gold Star Parent is
defined as a parent of a child who died in the line of duty while serving in
the United States Armed Forces during a period of war. Section 458-a of the
Real Property Tax Law permits a town to adopt a local law to include a Gold
Star Parent within the definition of a qualified owner to therefore be eligible
for the alternative veterans exemption. The Town wishes to adopt such local
law.
§ 253-48. Inclusion of Gold Star Parent as qualified owner.
For the purposes of eligibility for an alternative veterans exemption
authorized by § 458-a of the Real Property Tax Law, a Gold Star Parent,
as defined by § 458-a of the Real Property Tax Law, is included within the
definition of a qualified owner and to include property owned by a Gold Star
Parent within the definition of "qualifying residential property," provided
that such property shall be the primary residence of the Gold Star Parent.

Late Filing of Renewal Application for Partial Tax Exemption for
Senior Citizens
[Adopted 12-14-2016 by L.L. No. 5-2016]
§ 253-49. Legislative intent.
New York State has recently amended § 467 of the Real Property Tax Law
by adding a new subdivision, 8-a, which permits a municipal corporation
to adopt a local law providing that, where a renewal application for the
exemption authorized by § 467 of the Real Property Tax Law has not been
filed on or before the taxable status date, and the owner believes that
good cause existed for the failure to file the renewal application by that
date, the owner may, no later than the last day for paying taxes without
incurring interest or penalty, submit a written request to the assessor
asking him or her to extend the filing deadline and grant the exemption.
Such request shall contain an explanation of why the deadline was missed,
and shall be accompanied by a renewal application, reflecting the facts and
circumstances as they existed on the taxable status date. The assessor may
extend the filing deadline and grant the exemption if he or she is satisfied
that 1) good cause existed for the failure to file the renewal application
by the taxable status, and that 2) the applicant is otherwise entitled to the
exemption.
§ 253-50. Late filing requirements.
Where a renewal application for the exemption authorized by § 467 of the
Real Property Tax Law has not been filed on or before the taxable status
date, and the owner believes that good cause existed for the failure to file
the renewal application by that date, the owner may, no later than the last
day for paying taxes without incurring interest or penalty, submit a written
request to the assessor asking him or her to extend the filing deadline and
grant the exemption. Such request shall contain an explanation of why the
deadline was missed, and shall be accompanied by a renewal application,
reflecting the facts and circumstances as they existed on the taxable status
date. The assessor may extend the filing deadline and grant the exemption
if he or she is satisfied that 1) good cause existed for the failure to file
the renewal application by the taxable status, and that 2) the applicant
is otherwise entitled to the exemption. The assessor shall mail notice of
his or her determination to the owner. If the determination states that
the assessor has granted the exemption, he or she shall thereupon be
authorized and directed to correct the assessment roll accordingly, or, if
another person has custody or control of the assessment roll, to direct that
person to make the appropriate corrections. If the correction is not made
before taxes are levied, the failure to take the exemption into account in
the computation of the tax shall be deemed a "clerical error," and shall be
corrected accordingly.

appearance ticket or summons issued to the registrant shall be served
upon the operator, who shall be deemed the agent of the registrant only
for the purpose of receiving such appearance ticket or summons. In
addition, a notice containing all pertinent information relating to the
charge which is contained on the summons or appearance ticket shall
be mailed by or on behalf of the person who issued the appearance

address of the registrant on file with the Department of Motor Vehicles
of said state within five days after the date of issuance of the
appearance ticket or summons, but at least five days before the return
date specified on the appearance ticket or summons. Proof of mailing to
the registrant under this section shall be filed with the court in which
the appearance ticket or summons is returnable on or before the return
date. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to owneroperators
of any motor vehicle or to any motor vehicle or trailer which

trailer is being operated by an employee of the registrant or for a
community of interest other than the lease or rental agreement
between the parties to the lease or rental agreement.
P. In any case wherein the charge laid before the court alleges a violation
of this section, any plea of guilty thereafter entered in satisfaction of
such charge must include at least a plea of guilty to a violation of one of
the subsections of this section. No other disposition by plea of guilty to
any other charge in satisfaction of such shall be authorized; provided,
however, that if the prosecuting attorney, upon reviewing the available
evidence, determines that the charge of a violation of this section is not
warranted, he may consent, and the court may allow, a disposition by
plea of guilty to that or another charge in satisfaction of such charge;
provided, however, that the court must impose at least the minimum
fine as authorized in this section for the offense.

other lot.
C. No lot shall be formed from part of a lot already occupied by a building
or use unless such building or use, all yards, setbacks and open spaces
connected therewith and the remaining lot comply with all
requirements prescribed by this chapter for the district in which said
lot is located.
D. Any use not permitted by this chapter shall be deemed to be prohibited.
The list of prohibited uses contained in § 376-33 of this chapter shall not
be deemed to be an exhaustive list but has been included for the
§ 376-22 RAMAPO CODE § 376-23
1:396
purposes of clarity and emphasis and to illustrate, by example, some
of the uses frequently proposed that are deemed undesirable and
incompatible and are thus prohibited. Uses identified as special permit
uses shall be deemed prohibited unless a valid special permit shall be
issued by the Town Board or Planning Board.
E. Preexisting uses identified as special permit uses in this chapter, for
which there exists, on the effective date of this chapter or amendment
thereof, a valid certificate of occupancy, shall not be deemed
nonconforming unless such uses are noncomplying as to the bulk or
supplemental regulations of this chapter.
F. No building permit or certificate of occupancy or certificate of use shall
be granted for any use unless the Building Inspector shall find that the
use shall conform to the standards set forth in this chapter.
G. No land or buildings shall be used in any manner so as to create any
hazard to the public health, peace or comfort or to hinder the most
appropriate use of land in the vicinity.

ARTICLE IV
Bulk Regulations
§ 376-40. General requirements.
The general requirements relating to the arrangement of buildings,
structures and uses occupying a lot for the zoning districts established by
Article II are hereby established.
§ 376-41. Bulk Table.
The accompanying table entitled "Table of Bulk Requirements" shall be a
part of this chapter, is referred to herein as the "Bulk Table" and shall set
forth the minimum bulk requirements of this chapter.33
§ 376-42. Special bulk requirements.
A. The bulk table is divided into columns, each column headed by a
number for reference. The Bulk Table is divided by single horizontal
lines into groups, each group being identified by a letter corresponding
to the letter symbol appearing in the Use Table adjacent to each use or
combination of uses. Each of the uses within each group is regulated by
the bulk regulations for the indicated use group.
B. Other articles herein contain supplemental requirements applying to
bulk, setback and coverage of specified uses.
A. As part of any minimum lot area requirement of this chapter for all
uses, not more than 50% of any land underwater, subject to or within
the one-hundred-year-frequency floodplain, wetlands, within easements
or rights-of-way for overhead utilities, with slopes (unexcavated) of over
25% or within a designated street line of any road shall be counted
towards meeting the minimum lot area. In addition, at least 50% of the
minimum lot area requirement shall consist of land without the abovelisted
impediments. The application of this section to any particular lot
shall be the responsibility of the Town Planning Board at the time of
subdivision or site development plan approval. [Amended 6-14-2006
by L.L. No. 4-2006]
B. Street frontage for lots fronting on culs-de-sac or on a street with a
radius of curvature at the center line of 100 feet or less, or in other
appropriate circumstances, may be reduced by the Planning Board at
the time of subdivision plat approval to no less than 1/2 of the required
dimensions. No portion of the lot, along the access route from its
frontage into the lot, shall be narrower than the approved frontage.
C. In LO and PI Districts, no side setback, no side yard, no rear setback or
no rear yard shall be required where such setback abuts an overhead
utility transmission line right-of-way, railroad or a limited-access
33.Editor's Note: Said table is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 376-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 376-42
1:403
§ 376-43. Clustering.
highway. In such cases, the total width of both side setbacks shall be 75
feet in an LO District and 50 feet in a PI District.
D. The Planning Board, at the time of subdivision approval, may modify
and reduce the required lot width for any lot, but the same may not be
reduced to less than 1/2 of the required lot width.
A. Purpose, intent and applicability.
(1) The purpose of this section is to encourage flexibility of design and
development of land by an alternative method for the layout,
configuration and design of lots, buildings and structures, roads,
utility lines and other infrastructure, parks and landscaping to
preserve the natural and scenic qualities of open land. Cluster
development may provide incidental benefits such as the
facilitation of adequate and economical provision of streets and
utilities.
(2) The standards and procedures hereinafter set forth are adopted
pursuant to Town Law § 278. These standards and procedures are
hereby declared to be the sole manner in which the Town Board or
Planning Board may authorize development in a manner other than
as required by the strict application of this section and other
articles of this chapter.
(3) This section shall apply to all residential districts, except the R-15C
Districts. In multifamily districts, the Planning Board or Town
Board is authorized to approve coherent development of individual
or multiple sites to allow row houses (such as townhouses and patio
houses) and to allow apartments which may be rented or sold and
may be cooperatives or condominiums.
(4) This section may be applied provided that the undeveloped land
resulting from such provision is reserved as open space, and
provided that the entire development (including location and
architectural treatment of buildings and appurtenant facilities and
provisions for recreational areas, parking, egress and ingress, and
for landscaping) be built according to a site development plan
approved by the Planning Board with prior consent of the Town
Board, as required in this section.
(5) The dwelling units constructed pursuant to the standards and
procedures set forth herein may, at the discretion of the Planning
Board and subject to any conditions set forth by the Town Board, be
in detached, semiattached, attached or multistory structures.
(6) The provisions of this section shall not be deemed to authorize a
change in the permissible use of lands as provided for in this
chapter.
§ 376-42 RAMAPO CODE § 376-43
1:404
(7) The application of this section shall result in a permitted number of
building plots or dwelling units which shall in no case exceed the
number which, in the Planning Board's judgment, would be
permitted in a conventional preliminary subdivision plat meeting
requirements for lots conforming to the minimum lot size and
density requirements of this chapter applicable to the district or
districts in which such land is situated, and of the Town Law, as it is
now or may be amended, including Town Law § 276.
(8) The provisions of this section are not intended and shall not be
deemed to give the Planning Board the authority or the power to
apply or remove any other zoning designation or classification to
any area, district, zone, lot or parcel of land within the Town of
Ramapo.
B. Findings; objectives.
(1) The Town Board hereby finds that a substantial proportion of the
remaining undeveloped land in the Town is environmentally
sensitive and topographically difficult, and contains substantial
valuable natural assets deserving of protection. The Town Board
further finds that cluster development is a planning technique that
will significantly cut disturbance or loss of Ramapo's natural assets
by residential development. Clustering can provide for new
housing needs without increasing overall area unit density or
abbreviating landowner rights. Cluster development promotes
conservation of open space protecting its attributes and beauty.
(2) In keeping with the Town's primary goal for cluster development,
the Planning Board is directed to use cluster development to
protect:
(a) Steep slopes, rock outcrop, escarpments and ridgelines.
(b) Unique or distinctive natural or geological formations.
(c) Wetlands.
(d) Flood-prone areas.
(e) Watercourses and water bodies, including rivers, streams,
intermittent streams, lakes and ponds.
(f) Major stands of trees.
(g) Areas of rare, endangered and threatened vegetation.
(h) Wildlife habitat, especially that of rare, endangered or
threatened species.
(i) Historic structures, places or trails.
(j) Significant scenic views, particularly of water bodies, ridge
lines, hillsides, valleys and mountains, especially when visible
§ 376-43 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 376-43
1:405
from highways, roads, streets, parkland and other public
places.
(k) Buffers along roadways and other property boundaries that
will protect community or area character.
(l) Extensions of a public park or other protected open space or
connections between two or more parks or protected open
spaces or a combination of them.
(3) To the extent that they remain incidental to and consistent with the
primary purpose, the Planning Board may also consider providing
for such subordinate benefits as:
(a) Efficient and economical street, water supply, drainage and
sanitary sewer layouts.
(b) Innovation, flexibility and variety in the type, design and layout
of buildings so as to permit greater variety and range in the
choice of housing types, living environment, occupancy tenure
and housing cost.
(c) Flexibility in lot layout to achieve the best possible relationship
between development and existing topography.
C. Authorization to approve plans; application procedure.
(1) The Planning Board is hereby granted authority to modify
provisions of this chapter applicable to cluster development
simultaneously with its approval of a plat or plats, subject to
conditions stated in this section and such other reasonable
conditions as the Town Board in its discretion may add.
(2) An applicant desiring to use the standards set forth in this section
shall file, with the Planning Board, the application and plans
required for subdivision review and approval as set forth in
applicable provisions of this chapter and zoning regulations. Such
application and plans shall have clearly marked upon their face
that said plan is for development in accordance with these
standards. The applicant shall also submit a written, detailed
statement setting forth the nature of modifications, changes or
supplementations of existing zoning provisions and the reasons for
the same. Said statement shall include the manner in which such
modifications, changes or supplementations of existing zoning
provisions will benefit the Town and will further the purpose and
objectives set forth in this section. The applicant may be required,
at various stages of the planning process, to further justify his
request to use the standards and procedures set forth herein.
(3) If an applicant has not requested to use the standards set forth in
this section and seek approval of a cluster development, the
Planning Board may nevertheless require an applicant to submit an
§ 376-43 RAMAPO CODE § 376-43
1:406
application for cluster development subject to the criteria
contained in this section. Prior to the Planning Board determining
whether and to what extent a cluster development is to be
proposed where an applicant has not requested such a
development, the Planning Board shall determine that such a
proposal would benefit the Town by satisfying the purposes set
forth in this section, and that such a development plan is necessary
to satisfactorily achieve one or more of the specific objectives
stated in Subsection B(2) of this section.
(4) The applicant shall file the following maps and data, in a form as
the Planning Board shall require, so that a determination may be
made of the number of dwelling units which may be permitted by
the use of this section:
(a) A conventional sketch plat pursuant to this chapter and the
Town Subdivision Regulations.
(b) Any other data, plans and maps required by the Planning
Board.
(5) The Planning Board shall review the above documents to determine
compliance with the criteria set forth in this section and shall make
a determination of the number of lots or dwelling units which may
be permitted. If, in the Planning Board's judgment, the proposed
development is appropriate for processing pursuant to this section,
said Board shall transmit such application and other relevant
documents to the Town Board with a request for authority to act in
accordance with the standards set forth herein.
(6) After receipt of such request from the Planning Board, the Town
Board shall schedule an informational hearing relative to the
proposed use of the standards set forth herein. The applicant shall
comply with applicable requirements relating to notice to
interested parties. The applicant shall provide the Town Board with
such data, maps and plans as are required by the Town Board.
(7) The Town Board shall review the recommendation of the Planning
Board and determine whether or not to authorize the Planning
Board to process the proposed development pursuant to this
section. Said authorization, if granted, shall specify the lands to
which this procedure shall be applicable and may contain such
other reasonable conditions as the Town Board, in its discretion,
may add thereto.
(8) In the event that such authorization is granted, the Planning Board
shall process the application pursuant to subdivision laws, rules
and regulations, including review at public hearings held pursuant
to Town Law §§ 276 and 277.
§ 376-43 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 376-43
1:407
(9) Town Board authorization for use of the standards set forth in this
section shall expire and become void if any of the following events
do not occur within the time limits as set forth:
(a) The adoption of a resolution, by the Planning Board,
preliminarily approving a plat within nine months of the
aforesaid Town Board authorization. This preliminary approval
may be subject to conditions.
(b) The adoption of a resolution of final approval, by the Planning
Board within 24 months of the aforesaid Town Board
authorization. This final approval may be subject to conditions.
(c) Commencement of construction within 18 months from the
filing of the plat in the Rockland County Clerk's office. A note to
this effect shall be placed on the plat. If construction is not so
commenced, the plat shall be void.
(10) The Town Board may, upon request of the Planning Board, extend
any of the time periods set forth above.
D. Density calculations. The permitted density shall be determined on the
basis of a review of a conventional subdivision plat that, consistent with
applicable zoning regulations and practical considerations, could be
approved by the Planning Board.
E. Site standards.
(1) A "site" means the entire area of land proposed for development.
(2) The site, when developed, shall be served by an approved public
water supply system and an approved public sanitary sewer
system.
(3) The site shall have a minimum of 50 feet of frontage on an existing
public street or highway which is owned or maintained by the Town
of Ramapo, the County of Rockland or the State of New York
("public street").
(4) If the site is to contain attached dwelling units, no more than eight
such units shall be attached in any one cluster.
F. Lot standards.
(1) A "lot" means an area of land upon which detached dwelling is to be
built.
(2) The minimum lot size, regardless of zoning district, shall be not less
than: [Amended 6-14-2006 by L.L. No. 4-2006]
(a) Townhouse: 2,500 square feet.
(b) Semiattached: 5,000 square feet.
§ 376-43 RAMAPO CODE § 376-43
1:408
(c) Detached: 10,000 square feet.
(3) The minimum setbacks for each dwelling (or group of dwellings, in
the event that they are attached) shall be determined by the
Planning Board only after receipt of a recommendation from CDRC.
G. Open space preservation.
(1) In the event that the application of this procedure results in a plat
showing undeveloped lands available for park, recreation, open
space or other purposes, the Planning Board, as a condition of plat
approval, shall establish such conditions on the ownership, use and
maintenance of such lands as it deems necessary to assure the
preservation of such lands for their intended purposes.
(2) Any of such open spaces shall be shown on the plat with a notation
on the face thereof that such open spaces shall not be further
subdivided or used for future building lots.
(3) If any or all of the common open space is not dedicated to and
accepted by the Town, the formation and incorporation of a
neighborhood association, homeowners' association or other entity
approved by the Planning Board shall be required. At the discretion
of the Planning Board, documents indicating said formation shall
be presented, either prior to the signing of the plat, prior to the
granting of building permits or prior to the issuance of the first
certificate of occupancy for a dwelling within the plat. If required
by law, the approval of the Attorney General shall be obtained prior
to the formation of the association.
(4) Covenants for mandatory membership in the association shall be
approved by the Planning Board, filed in the Rockland County
Clerk's office and included, in whole or by reference, in the deed to
each lot.
(5) The association formed shall, in addition to any other rights or
responsibilities, be responsible for maintaining the common open
space(s) and operation and maintenance of any facilities within
such open space(s).
(6) The association shall be empowered to levy and shall levy, when
necessary, annual charges against all owners of lots to defray all
expenses in connection with the maintenance, ownership and
operation of open spaces and facilities placed thereon. The
documents forming such association and the covenant filed in the
Rockland County Clerk's office shall state that such charges, if
unpaid, shall become a lien against the property which is in default.
(7) The documents forming such association and the covenant filed in
the Rockland County Clerk's office shall additionally state that the
Town of Ramapo shall have the right, but not the obligation, by
§ 376-43 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 376-43
1:409
legal action or otherwise, to enforce the property owner's
obligation to pay any charges to the association.
(8) The developer or subdivider shall maintain control of such open
space(s) and be responsible for its maintenance until development
sufficient to support the association has taken place. Such
determination shall be made by the Building Inspector upon
request of the neighborhood association or developer or subdivider,
or the Planning Board may set forth conditions concerning the
transfer of the open space to the association, in its approving
resolution and/or by requiring an appropriate note to be placed
upon the plat.
(9) Prior to the signing of the plat, the subdivider or developer (except
where condominiums are to be constructed) shall execute an
agreement with the Town of Ramapo which the homeowners'
association shall be subject to, provided that, in the event that the
homeowners' association or any successor organization shall, at
any time after approval of the development, fail to maintain the
common land or any improvements thereon in reasonable order or
condition in accordance with the approved plan, the Town of
Ramapo may serve written notice upon such legal entity or
successor organization or upon the property owners within the
development, setting forth the manner in which the association has
failed to maintain the common land or any improvements thereon,
which said notice shall include a demand that such deficiencies be
corrected within a designated time frame. If the deficiencies are
not corrected within the designated time frame, the Town of
Ramapo, in order to preserve the taxable values of the property
within the development and to prevent the common land and
improvements thereon from becoming a public nuisance, may, but
shall not be obligated to, enter upon and take possession of said
common land and improvements and maintain the same until such
time as the Town Board shall determine that the homeowners'
association is ready and able to maintain the common land and
improvements in proper condition. Said entry and maintenance
shall not vest in the public any rights to use the common land or
improvements except when the same is voluntarily dedicated to the
public by the homeowners' association and the offer of dedication is
accepted by the Town Board. The decision of the Town of Ramapo
with respect to the action described in this subsection shall
constitute a final administrative decision subject to review in
accordance with the provisions of Article 78 of the Civil Practice
Law and Rules. The cost to the Town of Ramapo of any such
maintenance shall be assessed against the properties within the
subdivision, and, in the even of the failure or refusal of any such
property owner to pay any such charges when due, the unpaid
amount thereof shall become a lien against that person's property
and together with interest from the due date thereof, shall be
included in the annual tax levy of the Town of Ramapo upon such
§ 376-43 RAMAPO CODE § 376-43
1:410
property for each such fiscal year, and the amount so levied shall
be collected in the same manner as other Town taxes.

A. The Planning Board, in conjunction with site development plan
approval, may permit a reduction in the number of developed parking
spaces where adequate accessible reserve areas are available and
designated on the plan as areas for overflow parking.
B. The Planning Board may reduce the required number of parking spaces
upon demonstration by the applicant that that number exceeds the
design hour requirement and a demonstration that such reduction
would not induce parking on public ways or result in hazardous
conditions for vehicles and pedestrians within or proximate to the site.
This reduction by the Planning Board may not exceed 25% of the
normally required amount.
A. Location. Areas which may be considered as open or enclosed off-street
parking spaces include any private garage, carport or other area
available for parking, other than a street, entrance and exit lanes or a
driveway, except that no vehicle shall be parked or stored in any
required yard or fire lane except as permitted by § 376-51D. A driveway
behind the front house line may be utilized as parking spaces for onefamily,
two-family, and three-family residences. All driveways shall
include an adequate turnaround area to preclude the need for backing
onto a public road. [Amended 6-14-2006 by L.L. No. 4-2006]
B. Size of spaces. Minimum parking stall width shall be nine feet.
A. Access. Unobstructed access to and from a street shall be provided for
nonresidential uses. Such access shall consist of at least one twelve-foot

§ 376-73. Parking spaces adjacent to lots in residence districts.
Wherever a parking area of over five spaces abuts or is within 15 feet of a
lot in any residence district, it shall be screened from such residential lot
by a substantial wall, fence and/or landscaping, approved by the Planning
Board.
§ 376-74. Driveways.
No driveway shall provide access to a lot located in a nonresidential district
across land in a residential district.
§ 376-75. Commercial vehicles.
number of required spaces in such joint facilities shall not be less than
the total required for all such uses.
D. Combined uses. When any lot contains two or more uses having
different parking requirements, the parking requirements for each use
shall apply to the extent of that use. Where one or more such uses will
be generating a demand for parking spaces primarily during periods
when the other use or uses is not or are not in operation, the Planning
Board may reduce the total parking spaces required by 50% of the
parking spaces required for that use with the least requirement.
E. Location and ownership. Required accessory parking spaces shall be
provided upon the same lot as the use to which they are accessory or on
a nearby lot, provided that all spaces on the second lot are located
within 400 feet walking distance of the original lot along the existing
road network. Parking spaces shall conform to all the requirements of
the district in which the parking spaces are located. In no event shall
such parking spaces be located in any residence district unless the use
to which the spaces are accessory is permitted in such residence
district. Such spaces shall be in the same ownership as the use to which
they are accessory and shall be subject to deed restriction in a form
approved by the Town Attorney, binding the owner and his heirs and
assigns to maintain the required number of spaces available, either
throughout the existence of the use to which they are accessory or until
such spaces are provided elsewhere.
F. On lots divided by district boundaries. When a parking lot is located
partly in one district and partly in another district, the regulations for
the district requiring the greatest number of parking spaces shall apply
to the entire lot. Parking spaces on such lot may be located without
regard to district lines, provided that such parking spaces shall not be
located in any residence district unless the use to which they are
accessory is permitted in such district.
A. Not more than one commercial vehicle, of 25 feet or less in length, may

10 feet by 40 feet and a clear height of 15 feet for the first 20,000
square feet of gross floor area and one additional berth for each
additional 40,000 square feet of gross floor area or major portion
thereof. In NS and CS Districts, there shall be one loading berth with
minimum dimensions of 10 feet by 50 feet with a clear height of 15 feet
for the first 10,000 square feet of gross floor area and one additional
berth for each 20,000 square feet of gross floor area or major portion
thereof. In LO, PO and PI Districts, there shall be one loading berth with
minimum dimensions of 10 feet by 50 feet with a clear height of 15 feet
for the first 20,000 square feet of gross floor area and one additional
berth for each 40,000 square feet of gross floor area or major portion
thereof. The Planning Board may modify the minimum requirements
where necessary to ensure proper circulation and traffic safety or
where such change would not create future difficulties in the event that
the structures or uses are changed to any other use permitted by right
in the district.
B. Location and access. Unobstructed access, at least 12 feet wide, to and
from a street shall be provided to off-street loading berths. Such access
may be combined with access to parking areas. No off-street loading
berth shall be located between the street line and principal building. A
loading berth shall not be located in any required yard and shall be
screened where visible from any residential district boundary.

the aggregate of all such requirements.
D. On lots divided by district boundaries. When a lot is located partly in
one district and partly in another district, the regulations for the district
requiring the greater number of loading berths shall apply to the entire
lot. Loading berths on such lot may not be located in any residence
district unless the use to which they are accessory is permitted in such
district.
A. Access near street intersections. No entrance or exit for any accessory
off-street parking area with more than four parking spaces, nor for any
loading berth, shall be located closer than 75 feet to the intersection of
any two designated street lines as determined by the Official Map. This
distance shall be 100 feet for any signalized intersection or an
intersection providing for a designated left-turn lane on the same
intersection leg as the proposed access drive.
B. Screening. Parking areas with more than four spaces in a residential
district shall be screened from all property lines, including any roads
bordering the property. All parking areas and loading berths shall be
screened from any residential district boundary where visible. Such
screening shall not obstruct sight distance. The Planning Board may
require landscaping between nonresidential use parking areas to
prevent massing of such areas and to protect the character and
compatibility of adjacent uses.
C. Requirements for lighting. The Planning Board is empowered, subject
to § 376-190 and pursuant to § 274-a of the Town Law, to adopt rules
and regulations pertaining to lighting systems.

ARTICLE IX
Site Development Plan Review
§ 376-90. Approval required; exceptions.
No site development plan approval shall be required for one- or two- or
three family residential uses or for additions, alterations or structures
accessory thereto, except as provided for conversions of single-family
residences in the R-15C District in § 376-98. No site development plan
approval shall be required for caretaker's cottages, servants quarters, guest
houses and separate living quarters having a separate kitchen within a
one-family residence in the RR-160 and RR-80 Districts. All other principal
uses shall require a site development plan approval prior to the issuance
of a building permit, certificate of occupancy or certificate of use. No lot
or parcel of land shall be used except in conformity with an approved site
development plan, when required.
§ 376-91. Objectives.
In considering and acting upon site development plans, the Planning Board
shall take into consideration the public health, safety and welfare, the
comfort and convenience of the public in general and of the prospective
occupants of the proposed development and of the immediate neighborhood
in particular and may prescribe such appropriate conditions and safeguards
as may be required in order to further the expressed intent of this chapter
and accomplish the following objectives in particular:
A. Traffic access. All proposed traffic access will be adequate but not
excessive in number; adequate in width, grade, alignment and visibility;
not located too near street corners or other major access points; and
other similar safety considerations.
B. Circulation and parking. Adequate off-street parking and loading
spaces will be provided to prevent parking of vehicles on public streets.
The interior circulation system will be adequate to provide safe
accessibility to all required off-street parking.
C. Landscaping and screening. All recreation areas, parking and service
areas will be reasonably screened from the view of adjacent residential
lots and streets at all seasons of the year.
D. Compatibility. Signs and lights will be compatible and in scale with
building elements and will not predominate the overall visual impact of
the project. Textures of buildings and paved areas will be sufficiently
varied to prevent a massive or monolithic appearance, particularly
areas of asphaltic paving for parking.
E. Environment. The design, layout and operational characteristics of the
proposed use will not represent significant impact on the environment
or result in a waste of the land and other natural resources of the Town.
To the greatest possible extent, development will be in harmony with
§ 376-90 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 376-91
1:431
§ 376-92. Procedures.
§ 376-93. Informal submission review.
the natural environment and adequate compensatory devices will be
prescribed to offset potential significant deterioration resulting from
the project.
F. Development. The site development plan elements, including buildings,
parking, drainage, circulation, signs and lighting, will not adversely
affect the potential of adjacent properties or the property under review
from its highest and best use.
A. Prior to application for a building permit, certificate of occupancy or
certificate of use, where required, site development plan approval shall
be secured from the Planning Board. The applicant has the option of
choosing between a formal application for approval and an informal
submission for review. The site development plan rules and regulations
provide detailed specifications as to application materials. For purposes
of an informal submission, the applicant should provide as much
information as he can, keeping in mind the specific criteria specified in
the site development plan rules and regulations. The preapplication
review by the Planning Board shall not constitute a formal application,
and no approval can be granted based on it. At this time the applicant
should outline any modifications he is requesting from the
requirements specified in the site development plan rules and
regulations.
B. Submissions for site development plan review shall be made on forms
prescribed by the Planning Board and accompanied by a fee in
accordance with the Standard Schedule of Fees of the Town of Ramapo.
Such submission shall be submitted to the Director of Building,
Planning and Zoning, or his agent, at least three weeks prior to the
Planning Board meeting at which review is sought. The Director of
Building, Planning and Zoning, or his agent, shall determine if the
submission is in proper form and if so shall cause it to be referred to
such Town department, agencies and consultants as are necessary to
evaluate the proposal and shall cause a consolidated report to be
prepared by the Community Design Review Committee for the next
available Planning Board agenda. Applications not in proper form shall
be rejected, in writing, within 10 days after submission. A copy of such
rejection shall be sent to the Planning Board.
A. An applicant, at his discretion, may submit, prior to a formal application
for final site development plan approval, an application for informal
review. The applicant shall submit all application materials provided for
in the site development plan rules and regulations in as much detail as
he feels is warranted to enable the Planning Board to come to an
informal conclusion as to the merits of the proposal. Should variances
from the requirements of this chapter be contemplated, their nature

and degree should be specified. The application for informal review
shall be made and processed in the manner specified in § 376-92B.
B. The Planning Board will review the proposed plan and may grant
informal concept approval with such conditions as are necessary to
ensure conformity of said plans with the general and specific criteria
set forth in this chapter and other applicable rules and regulations of
the Town of Ramapo. In reviewing a site development plan application
which has been granted a special permit by the Town Board, the
Planning Board shall ensure conformity with any special permit
requirements.
A. An application for final site development plan approval shall be made in
the same manner as prescribed for preliminary approval as specified in
the site development plan rules and regulations.
B. The final site development plan and all supporting materials shall be
subject to review and consultation in the same manner as the
preliminary site development plan, and a consolidated report shall be
prepared and submitted to the Planning Board by the Community
Design Review Committee. The Board shall make a determination on
the application within 62 days of the close of the public hearing. In the
event no determination is made within 62 days and the applicant has
not waived the time requirements, the application shall be deemed
approved. The Board shall include such conditions of approval as were
required and in addition:
(1) The Planning Board shall require that on- or off-site improvements
be installed, including but not limited to on- or off-site drainage
systems, to ensure that all drainage, storm runoff and subsurface
waters are carried into approved watercourses and drainage
systems shown on the Official Map. The Planning Board shall
further require that all such off-site improvements and/or drainage
systems be installed on property granted to the Town by fee,
easement or otherwise, as determined by the Planning Board.
(2) No certificate of occupancy or use shall be issued for the site until
all the improvements shown on the site development plan,
including off-site requirements, required by the site development
plan have been duly installed and all easements and property
interests granted or dedicated to the Town.
(3) A partial certificate of occupancy or use for periods of 90 days, but
not more than one year in the aggregate, for a building, structure
or part thereof may be issued before all the on-site improvements
are complete; provided, nonetheless, that such portion or portions
of the site improvements as are necessary to permit the site to be
occupied safely without endangering life or the public welfare have
been completed. The Building Inspector shall require a cash

approved site plan and file one copy with the Building Inspector, who may
thereafter issue a building permit, certificate of occupancy and certificate of
use in reliance thereon in accordance with Article XIV. A site plan approval
shall be valid for a period of 18 months unless a building permit has been
issued.
§ 376-96. Amendments to approved plans.
An application for an amendment of any approved site development plan for
a site which has received prior final site development plan approval shall
be processed in accordance with the preceding provisions. However, only
those site development plan elements proposed to be modified or changed
need be presented, except where such modifications or changes have a
material and substantial impact on the balance of the site development plan
and functioning of the site. The applicant's licensed design professional
shall submit a letter, and a drawing when necessary, indicating the scope
of the proposed change no later than 20 days before a Planning Board
meeting for a determination by the Planning Board as to whether the
proposed amendment shall require a public hearing. Fees for an amended
site development plan approval shall be in accordance with the Standard
Schedule of Fees of the Town of Ramapo.

approved by the Town Attorney to ensure and guarantee the
completion of the on-site improvements. The Building Inspector
shall determine the sum of such cash deposit or letter of credit or
other security.
(4) The site shall be developed in strict conformity with the approved
site development plan except as provided for below. When the
approval of a field change (see definition of "field change") is
requested of the Building Inspector or other appropriate Town
inspection agency, such request shall be submitted to the
appropriate inspecting agency in writing. No field change shall be
valid unless a copy of the requested change is filed with the
Planning Board, with the approval of the appropriate agency noted

ARTICLE X
Architectural Review
§ 376-100. Purpose.
To ensure high standards for the visual environment of the Town of Ramapo,
architectural review is to be conducted by the Town's Community Design
Review Committee (CDRC) as an integral part of the building, planning and
zoning process. Such an architectural review will promote and protect the
health, safety, economic and general welfare of the community. Effective
action by the CDRC in inhibiting development deleterious to the visual
environment will prevent loss of tax revenue to the Town of Ramapo and
will prevent destruction of the proper balance between the taxable value of
real property and the cost of Town services provided therefor. It is the intent
of the Town Board to prevent excessive uniformity of exterior building
design in commercial and residential structures where such uniformity shall
be deemed inappropriate and detrimental to the visual environment. It is
also the intent of the Town Board to prevent excessive dissimilarity of
exterior building design in commercial and residential structures where
such dissimilarity shall be deemed inappropriate and detrimental to the
visual environment. It is the intent of the Town Board to preserve the
aesthetic value of natural and man-made features and structures and to
prevent the harmful effects of potentially unattractive or inappropriate
projects and the use of potentially unattractive or inappropriate building
materials insofar as they may affect the visual environment. The Town
Board finds that it benefits the interest of public welfare to ensure high
standards of quality of design for commercial, industrial and residential
structures, exterior landscaping and development planning and, by this
article, seeks to achieve these stated purposes.
§ 376-101. Community Design Review Committee.
In addition to its other functions, the CDRC shall act as an architectural
board of review. When meeting in its architectural review capacity, a
majority of its members shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business. A vote of the majority of the Committee is required for the
Committee to act. A record of its proceedings shall be maintained. The
CDRC shall operate under such rules and regulations as it may adopt insofar
as they do not supersede any requirements of this article and insofar as they
guarantee due process to any applicant. The CDRC shall schedule meetings
at regular intervals and in accordance with all provisions of the New York
State Open Meetings Law.37 The Committee members shall designate a
Chairperson from among its members.
§ 376-102. Jurisdiction.
A. The CDRC shall conduct an architectural review and advise on all plans
in the following categories:

the cost to be in excess of $15,000.
(7) All site development plans submitted to the Planning Board.
[Amended 8-15-2013 by L.L. No. 5-2013]
(8) Petitions for special permit uses when CDRC advice on such a
petition is requested by the Town Board.
(9) Plans or proposals which in the opinion of the Building Inspector
violate the spirit and intent of this chapter.
(10) Plans in which approval of design and specifications have been
legally and specifically delegated to the Town Board and/or the
Planning Board may be exempt from mandated CDRC review with
the exception of site plan approvals as designated in Subsection
A(6) above. The Town Board and/or Planning Board may, in its
discretion, request CDRC review in the case of such plans.
B. Where architectural review and approval is required, no building
permit may be issued by the Building Inspector until such approval is
obtained.
A. Where architectural review is required, an applicant should apply as
soon as practicable to enable a prompt review by CDRC and to enable
coordination of review and decisions by the CDRC and other approving

bodies or officials, as may be appropriate. [Amended 8-15-2013 by
L.L. No. 5-2013]
B. The CDRC shall render its decision on the basis of its adopted rules and
regulations with full regard to all requirements of due process and the
following guidelines. The Director of Building, Planning and Zoning
shall assist the applicant and shall collate essential plans and
information already filed with the Planning Board or Building
Department for the purpose of presenting cases to the CDRC. Such

showing contours at two-foot intervals and the project location,
including all setbacks, yards, driveways, parking areas and
adjacent homes.
(5) Area map showing surrounding streets and lots, at a scale deemed
appropriate by the Building Inspector.
(6) Three-dimensional sketch or rendering illustrating significant
aspects of construction and exterior design, when deemed
necessary or useful and requested by the CDRC and at a scale
deemed appropriate by the CDRC.
C. The Building Inspector shall encourage submission by applicants of
preliminary designs for CDRC review and comment prior to final design
submission to avoid the financial burden of completing drawings or
designs that may be questionable.
D. An application fee in accordance with the Standard Schedule of Fees of
the Town of Ramapo shall be submitted to the Building Department by
owner.
E. The CDRC shall make every effort to avoid undue financial hardship on
any applicant in support of the intent of this chapter. However, the
factor of increased construction cost will not automatically be
considered indicative of undue hardship or excessive standards. It is
not the responsibility of the CDRC to provide design services to
applicants. Design guidelines as may be adopted by the Town shall be
made available to all applicants.
F. Any plan disapproved by the CDRC and accompanied by the report
surrounding that disapproval shall be returned to the applicant by the
§ 376-103 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 376-103

§ 376-104. Decision process; actions following decisions.
Building Inspector. It is the intent of this chapter that such a plan be
resubmitted to the CDRC for reconsideration and approval when it has
been appropriately modified to meet stated objections.
G. Failure of the CDRC to report to the referring agency and/or the Town
Clerk within 45 days of its first regular meeting following receipt of an
application and all necessary plans and information required for
approval shall be construed as indication that the CDRC has no
objection to the proposal and intends to issue its approval.
H. Any substantial change in siting or in the exterior appearance of an
approved project may be subject to review and reconsideration by the
CDRC at the discretion of the Building Inspector.
A. The CDRC shall report its decision on each case referred to it, in
writing, within 45 days of its first regular meeting following receipt of
application for approval. Copies of such reports are to be distributed to
any agency of the Town of Ramapo concerned with the project under
consideration. A copy of each such report shall be placed in the Building
Department file.
B. The CDRC may make the following findings:
(1) "Approved." This finding shall be indicative that the plan will not be
detrimental to the visual environment, meets the standards
required by the Town of Ramapo and may proceed through
prescribed channels with the approval of the CDRC.
(2) "Approved with conditions." This finding shall be indicative that the
plan will meet the standards of the "approved" category with minor
adjustments. Projects in this category may be issued a building
permit with the requirement that those adjustments be made and
documented to the satisfaction of the Building Inspector. Further
review and approval by the CDRC shall not be required.
(3) "Action reserved." This finding shall be indicative that insufficient
information is available to the CDRC for a final decision. In such a
case, the CDRC shall indicate what additional information is
required. Upon receipt by the Building Inspector of the additional
data from the applicant, the matter shall be placed on the CDRC
agenda for further consideration at the earliest possible time.
(4) "Disapproved." This finding shall be indicative that the plan is
found to be detrimental to the visual environment and beneath the
standards of design required by the Town of Ramapo. The
disapproved plan is to be returned to the applicant and to the
referring agency, accompanied by a written explanation of the
reasons for the disapproval.

approve or disapprove plans presented to it. Unless repudiated by appeal,
as outlined in § 376-106 of this chapter, decisions of the CDRC represent
the official position of the Town of Ramapo and its elected Town Board in
the effort to maintain high standards for the visual environment as noted in
§ 376-100 of this chapter.
§ 376-106. Appeals.

exterior design or appearance: apparently identical front, side or
other elevation visible from a street; substantially identical size and
arrangement of either doors, windows, porticos or other openings
or breaks in the elevation facing the street, including reverse
arrangement; other significant identical features of design,
including but not limited to material, roofline, height or other
design elements, provided that a finding of excessive similarity
shall not only state that such similarity exists but that it is of such a
nature as to be reasonably expected to cause one or more of the
harmful effects as described in § 376-100 of this chapter.
(2) Excessive dissimilarity or inappropriateness in relation to any other
structures existing or for which a building permit has been issued
or to any other structure included in the same permit application,
facing upon the same or intersecting street within 1,000 feet of the
proposed site as measured along the center lines of streets in a
residential district and within 500 feet of a proposed site in any
district other than residential, in respect to one or more of the
following features: cubical contents, gross floor area, height and
other significant design features, included but not limited to
materials or quality of architectural design, provided that a finding
of excessive dissimilarity shall not only state that such dissimilarity
exists but that it is of such a nature as to be reasonably expected to

appropriate modeling, photography and other pertinent analytical
techniques. Landscaping and/or other screening, including but not
limited to architectural treatment, use of neutral or compatible coloring
and materials or alternative technologies, shall be required to minimize
the visual impact of such facility from pubic thoroughfares, important
viewsheds and vantage points and surrounding properties to the extent
practicable. No signs, other than signs not to exceed six square feet
listing the owner's or operator's name and emergency telephone
number, shall be erected on any wireless communication services
facility.

ARTICLE XIII
Nonconforming Uses, Buildings or Lots
§ 376-130. Applicability of article.
This article applies to lots, buildings, structures and nonbuilding uses in
existence on the effective date of this chapter. The lawful use of any such
premises or uses existing on the effective date of this chapter may be
continued although neither such use conforms nor the bulk of the same
complies with the requirements, except as hereinafter follows.
§ 376-131. Nonconforming buildings, structures or lots.
A. Residential buildings or structures. Any existing one- or two- or threefamily
residential building or structure, or building accessory thereto,
made noncomplying as to bulk by this chapter or any amendment
thereof shall be permitted to comply with the yard and setback
requirements as specified for the highest residential district having the
same or less lot width. In no event, however, shall the yard and setback
requirements of any lot be less than the requirements for the R-15
District. No front setback may in any event be closer to the designated

building permit. Said subdivision or part thereof shall be resubmitted to
the Planning Board for approval in accordance with the applicable
provisions of this chapter. Any lot in a subdivision approved by the
Planning Board after the effective date of this chapter, but which is
made noncomplying as to bulk by any future amendments of this
chapter, shall have three years from the date of filing to obtain a
building permit.
D. Noncomplying lots.
(1) A residential lot, separated from any other land in the same
ownership and noncomplying as to bulk, whether or not located in
§ 376-130 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 376-131
1:467
and part of a subdivision plat approved by the Planning Board and
filed in the office of the County Clerk, and which has a minimum
lot width of 100 feet, may be used for a one-, two- or three-family

following minimum requirements shall apply:
(a) The minimum width of each required side setback shall be 20
feet in the LO and PI Districts and 10 feet in the PO, NS and CS
Districts, except that where any setback abuts a residential
district, the normal requirements for setbacks, yards and
buffers shall apply.

§ 376-132. Additional considerations.
E. A lot shall not be considered noncomplying with respect to the front
setback or front yard requirements of this chapter if said condition is
the result of a street right-of-way widening, reservation or dedication,
whether in fee or easement, required by the Planning Board at the time
of subdivision or site development plan approval.
A. Repair and alterations. Normal maintenance and repair of a building or
structure is permitted if it does not extend the nonconforming use. No
extension, alteration or enlargement shall be made in a building or
structure occupied by a nonconforming use, nor in a nonconforming
nonbuilding use except:
(1) When required pursuant to an order of a court of competent
jurisdiction.
(2) To adapt the building or structure to a conforming use
(3) In a building or structure occupied by a nonconforming use or in a
nonconforming nonbuilding use permitted to extend under
Subsection D of this section.
B. Change of use. Any nonconforming use may be changed to any
conforming use or, on application to and with the approval the Board of
Appeals, to any use which the Board of Appeals deems to be more
similar in character with the uses permitted in the district in which said
change of use is proposed. Any nonconforming building, structure or
nonbuilding use may be changed to a con forming use, regardless of
whether the newly created conforming use is noncomplying as to bulk,
subject to approval by the Board of Appeals, subject to the same
general considerations applicable to the granting of special permits and
subject to site development plan approval.
C. Cessation of use. If active and continuous operations are not carried on
in a nonconforming use during a continuous period of one year, the
building or land where such nonconforming use previously existed shall
thereafter be occupied and used only for a conforming use. Intent to
resume active operations shall not affect the foregoing. The time period
set forth herein shall be tolled for any cessation of use pursuant to a
court order.
D. "Permitted extension or enlargement" shall mean:
(1) In the case of a nonconforming use in a building: the enlargement
or extension of such use so as to create additional floor area within
any existing building to any portion of the floor area therein not
formerly used for such nonconforming use, except where such
additional floor area was manifestly designed for such use at the
time such use became nonconforming.
§ 376-131 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 376-132
1:469
(2) In the case of a nonconforming nonbuilding use: the use of any
additional land on which no substantial operations were previously
conducted, provided that any such extension or enlargement is on
the same lot occupied by the nonconforming use on the effective

nonconforming use or noncomplying bulk, then the Board of Appeals
may grant such an extension of the period prescribed as it shall deem to
be reasonable and adequate for such amortization, provided that no
such period of extension shall exceed 100% of the period prescribed
and that such extension may be granted only once for any use.
G. Continued use after termination date is a violation. The continuation of
a nonconforming use or noncomplying bulk after the termination date

determination by the Board consisting of alternate members shall have
weight and be entitled to the same authority as the act or deed of the
regular Planning Board, and all laws, statutes and regulations shall

appointed pursuant to this section shall be paid for their respective
services as fixed by resolution of the Town Board.

§ 376-151. Powers and duties.
The Board of Appeals shall have all the powers and duties prescribed by
statute and by this chapter, which are more particularly specified as follows,
provided that none of the following provisions shall be deemed to limit any
power of the Board that is conferred by law.
A. Appeals. The Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals from and
review any order, requirement, decision or determination of the
Building Inspector or such other official charged with the enforcement
of this chapter or the Community Design Review Committee acting in
its capacity as an architectural review board. The Board of Appeals

been directed by the Town Board. In addition, the Board of Appeals may
not waive the requirement for site development plan application as
required in any part of this chapter.
B. Interpretation. On an appeal from any order, requirement, decision or
determination made by an administrative official or by the Building
Inspector to decide any of the following questions:

chapter or of any condition or requirement specified or made under
the provisions of this chapter.
(2) Determination of the exact location of any district boundary shown
on the Zoning Map.
C. Variances. On appeal from an order, requirement, decision or
determination made by the Building Inspector, or on referral of an
applicant to the Board by an approving agency acting pursuant to this
chapter, the Board of Appeals is authorized to vary or modify the strict
letter of this chapter as set forth below, except that in no case may a
variance be granted from provisions of the New York State Uniform Fire
Prevention and Building Code and the State Energy Conservation
Construction Code: [Amended 11-10-2016 by L.L. No. 4-2016]
(1) Area variances.
§ 376-150 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 376-151
1:483
(a) The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power, upon an
appeal from a decision or determination of an administrative
official charged with the enforcement of this chapter, to grant
area variances from the area or dimensional requirements of
such ordinance or local law.
(b) In making its determination, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
take into consideration the benefit to the applicant if the
variance is granted, as weighed against the detriment to the
health, safety and welfare of the neighborhood or community
by such grant. In making such determination, the Board shall
also consider:
[1] Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the
character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby
properties will be created by the granting of the area
variance;
[2] Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be
achieved by some method, feasible for the applicant to
pursue, other than an area variance;
[3] Whether the requested area variance is substantial;
[4] Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect
or impact on the physical or environmental conditions in
the neighborhood or district; and
[5] Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which
consideration shall be relevant to the decision of the Board
of Appeals, but shall not necessarily preclude the granting
of the area variance.
(c) The Board of Appeals, in the granting of area variances, shall
grant the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and
adequate and at the same time preserve and protect the
character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and
welfare of the community.
(2) Use variances.
(a) The Board of Appeals, on appeal from the decision or
determination of the administrative official charged with the
enforcement of such ordinance or local law, shall have the
power to grant use variances, authorizing a use of the land
which otherwise would not be allowed or would be prohibited
by the terms of this chapter.
(b) No such use variance shall be granted by a Board of Appeals
without a showing by the applicant that applicable zoning
regulations and restrictions have caused unnecessary hardship
the applicant shall demonstrate to the Board of Appeals that:
§ 376-151 RAMAPO CODE § 376-151
1:484
§ 376-152. Rules of procedure.
[1] Under applicable zoning regulations the applicant is
deprived of all economic use or benefit from the property
in question, which deprivation must be established by
competent financial evidence;
[2] That the alleged hardship relating to the property in
question is unique and does not apply to a substantial
portion of the district or neighborhood;
[3] That the requested use variance, if granted, will not alter
the essential character of the neighborhood; and
[4] That the alleged hardship has not been self-created.
(c) The Board of Appeals, in the granting of use variances, shall
grant the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and
adequate to address the unnecessary hardship proven by the
applicant, and at the same time, preserve and protect the
character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and
welfare of the community.
D. Imposition of conditions. The Board of Appeals shall, in the granting of
both use variances and area variances, have the authority to impose
such reasonable conditions and restrictions as are directly related to
and incidental to the proposed use of the property, or the period of time
such variance shall be in effect. Such conditions shall be consistent with
the spirit and intent of this chapter and shall be imposed for the
purpose of minimizing any adverse impact such variance may have on
the neighborhood or community.
E. Extensions across district boundaries. In appropriate cases where a lot
lies within two districts, the Board of Appeals may permit the extension
of existing or proposed permitted accessory off-street parking space
across a district boundary, under such conditions as will safeguard the
character of the district into which such use is extended. However, no
such extension shall exceed 75 feet, measured at right angles to such
district boundary. The power under this subsection shall not permit the
moving of the zoning district line but only the extension of the
accessory off-street parking space.
F. The Board of Appeals, after a public hearing, shall have the power to
direct the Building Inspector to issue a building permit, certificate of
occupancy or certificate of use, as the case may be, subject to other
applicable laws, codes, rules and regulations.
A. The Board of Appeals may adopt rules and regulations with respect to
procedure before it and with respect to any subject matter over which it
has jurisdiction, subject to approval of the Town Board. Such
regulations shall include provisions for conduct of meetings,
notification of parties, form of applications and filing of decisions.

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that the Town Board of the Town of Ramapo adopted the
following local law at a regular meeting held on the 26th day of February 2020 at the Ramapo Town
Hall, 237 Route 59, Suffern, New York:
LOCAL LAW NO. 2 OF 2020
AMENDING CHAPTER 376, ZONING,
TO CHANGE THE ZONING MAP OF THE TOWN OF RAMAPO
TO REZONE CERTAIN PARCELS OF LAND
FROM THE R-15 ZONING DISTRICT CLASSIFICATION TO
THE MR -12 ZONING DISTRICT CLASSIFICATION
BE IT ENACTED by the Town Board of the Town of Ramapo as follows:
Section 1: Title
This Local Law shall be known and cited as " Local Law No..2 of 2020, Amending the Zoning Map of
the Town of Ramapo to Rezone Certain Parcels of Land from the R- 15 Zoning District Classification
to the MR -12 Zoning District Classification."
Section 2: Legislative Intent
1. The Town Board, upon being petitioned by the owners of certain property, and upon its own
initiative, considered the rezoning of certain lands commonly known as Pascack Ridge, and to that end
directed that proposed amendments to the Town' s 2004 Comprehensive Plan and this proposed local
law be prepared to reclassify certain parcels ofland, presently included in the R-15 Residential Zoning
District ( 15, 000 square feet per lot), into the MR -12 Multifamily Zoning District (maximum 12 units
per acre).
2. The Town Board held initially held a public hearing on the petitions in 2014, at which time it
considered potential amendments to the 2004 Comprehensive Plan and the Town Zoning Map,
thereafter required preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement on the proposed action, accepted
a Draft Environmental Impact Statement and held public hearings on a proposed local law,
Comprehensive Plan amendments and the DEIS on August 15, 2018, accepted a Final Environmental
Impact Statement, referred the proposed zoning amendments to the Rockland County Planning
Department and the Town Planning Board for their recommendations, and held public hearings on a
revised local law, revised Comprehensive Plan amendments, and a Technical Addendum to the FEIS
on August 15, 2019, at which hearing and during the following written comment period, it received
public comment on the revised local law, revised Comprehensive Plan amendments, the FEIS and the
Technical Addendum thereto. On considering the comments ofthe public and involved and interested
agencies, the reports of the County Planning Department and Town Planning Board, as well as the
advice of its planning consultants, the Town Board thereafter directed revisions to the proposed
Comprehensive Plan and zoning amendments.
3. The Town Board has adopted, in its capacity as SEQRA Lead Agency, its SEQRA Findings
Statement setting forth its findings with respect to the environmental review of the proposed SEQRA
action, and alternatives thereto, and has considered therein the recommendation of its consulting
planner that certain properties being considered for rezoning should retain their existing zoning. 
4. Having studied the proposed rezoning action, including the petitions, proposed amendments to the
Town' s 2004 Comprehensive Plan to reflect current conditions in the area of the Town that would be
rezoned, a conceptual development plan known as Pascack Ridge and the environmental review
documents prepared in connection with that action, the Town Board finds that the proposed rezoning,
revised to exclude those parcels identified by its consulting planner, is reasonable and appropriate to
respond to the growth of the Town' s population, meet the current housing needs of the Town and its
residents, and further finds that the proposed rezoning fulfills the purposes of Chapter 376 as stated in
376- 3. A through J, and is consistent with the goals and objectives ofthe Town Comprehensive Plan,
as amended.
5. The adoption of this Local Law is determined to be an exercise of the Town' s powers pursuant to
the Municipal Home Rule Law, and is further considered an proper exercise of the police powers of
the Town to protect the public health, safety and welfare of its residents by acting to increase the supply
of safe housing resources needed to meet the Town' s housing needs.
6. The Town Board finds that the revised local law, which excludes certain parcels that were considered
for rezoning from being rezoned due to size, location and constraints that indicate they are not suitable
for development of multifamily housing and would therefore be rendered nonconforming parcels if
they were subject to the MR -12 zoning regulations, to be entirely within the embrace of the duly
noticed zoning amendment considered at the August 15, 2019 public hearing, and is consistent with
public comment urging the Board to retain the R- 15 zoning district on the east side ofPascack Brook.
Section 3: Amendment to Article II, Section 376- 21, Zoning Map of the Town of Ramapo
Chapter 376, titled "Zoning," of the Code ofthe Town of Ramapo is amended by revising the Zoning
Map of the Town ofRamapo, which was duly established pursuant to § 137-21, titled " Zoning Map,"
to change the zoning district designation of the list of parcels annexed as Exhibit B from the existing
R-15 Residential Zoning District ( 15, 000 square feet per lot) zoning to the proposed MR -12
Multifamily Zoning District (maximum 12 units per acre) zoning, as shown on that portion of the
Zoning Map annexed hereto as Exhibit A entitled, "Proposed Zoning Map Amendments Associated
with Pascack Ridge Rezoning Petition," dated February 7, 2020.
In the event of a conflict between the Zoning Map amendment attached as Exhibit A and the list of tax
map parcels annexed as Exhibit B, the inclusion of a tax map parcel, or any portion thereof, in the area
shown on the Zoning Map shall be dispositive.
Section 4: Severability
If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section or part of this Local Law shall be adjudged by any court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment shall be confined to the clause, sentence,
paragraph, section or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judgment shall
have been rendered, and shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remaining portions hereof, which
shall remain in full effect.
Section 5: Effective Date
This Local Law shall take effect immediately upon filing with the Secretary of State.
