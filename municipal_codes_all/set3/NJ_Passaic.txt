There shall be a Board of Alcoholic Beverage Control.
A. Appointment; composition; term. The Board shall be comprised of three
members, not more than two of whom shall be of the same political
party, who shall be appointed by the Mayor with the advice and consent
of the Council. Each member shall serve for a term of three years,
provided that of those first appointed one shall be appointed to a term

application must be filed with the Municipal Court on a form to be
provided by the City. The Municipal Court Judge shall make a
decision as to whether a defendant is indigent after reviewing each
defendant's application. This determination shall be based upon
whether the defendant has the present financial ability to secure
competent legal representation and to provide all other necessary
expenses of representation.
(2) The Municipal Court Judge shall assess an application fee of not
more than $200 from each defendant who makes an application for
the services of the Public Defender. This fee shall be due regardless
of whether the applicant is found to require the services of the
Public Defender. However, the Municipal Court Judge may waive
this fee, in whole or in part, consistent with N.J.S.A. 28:24-17a, if
the Judge determines, in his/her discretion, upon a clear and
convincing showing by the applicant, that this application fee
represents an unreasonable burden on such defendant.
(3) The defendant's inability to pay the application fee shall in no way
affect or reduce the rendering of service to him/her. In the case of a
defendant who is unable to or unwilling to pay the application fee
and for whom the fee was not waived, such fee shall become a lien
and the City may collect the fee consistent with N.J.S.A. 2B:24-16 or
in any other manner as permitted by law.12

A. Purpose. New Jersey has adopted the Open Public Records Act, N.J.S.A.
47:1A-5, which has as its general purpose making government records
more available to the public than they have been in the past. In certain
instances, the production of voluminous records, archived records or
records in a format which is not the usual format maintained by the
municipality or other special circumstances is costly and time
consuming. The New Jersey Open Public Records Act permits the
municipality to require the payment of fees, special service charges
and/or special charges as a prerequisite to the production of records
§ 5-128 PASSAIC CODE § 5-128.2
1:84
requiring extraordinary time and effort, special equipment or special
formatting.
B. No research or interpretation may be compelled. Nothing in this section
shall require the custodian or deputy custodians of documents or any
other municipal official to examine, analyze, tabulate or interpret
documents which are subject to production under the New Jersey Open
Public Records Act.
C. Special service charge/special charges authorized.
(1) Charges authorized. The City Clerk or deputy custodian producing
governmental records under the New Jersey Open Public Records
Act shall be entitled to collect a special service charge on behalf of
the City and/or special charges as set forth in this section.
(2) Requests to be in writing. Any requests for documents shall be
made to the City Clerk or deputy custodian of records in writing
and preferably on a form established by the City Clerk for such
purposes.
(3) Advance notice of fees, special service charges and special
charges; deposit. Any requester of government records which may
be eligible for the imposition of a fee, special charge or special
service charge under this section shall receive advance notice of
the amount of fees and charges before any work is started. The City
Clerk shall require prepayment of such charges before causing the
work to begin.
D. Fees, special service charges and special charges; when charged;
amounts authorized.
(1) Duplication or other work beyond capability of municipal in-house
work force. Whenever the in-house municipal work force or
available municipal equipment is insufficient to duplicate or
produce government records in a timely fashion, the City Clerk may
cause such duplication or production to be accomplished by outside
vendors such as copy centers or producers of digital images. If the
costs of such duplication or production charged by such vendors
exceeds the routine charges set forth in N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5, the actual
direct cost of same without any additional surcharge for labor costs
shall be paid.
(2) Special service charges authorized. Whenever government records
cannot be reproduced by regular copying equipment or fulfillment
of the request would involve extraordinary time and effort (for
example, where a large number of records must be recovered from
storage or substantive staff time is required to review, redact, sort
and/or assemble records), charges may be imposed as follows:
(a) The actual cost (materials and supplies but no staff labor) of
duplication or reproduction; plus
§ 5-128.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 5-128.2
1:85
§ 5-129. Delivery of funds and records required upon termination of
office.
Upon the termination of the term of office or the employment of any officer
or employee, he shall forthwith deliver to his successor or, if there be no
successor, to the Clerk or other person who may be designated by the Mayor
to receive the same all moneys, papers, books, memorandums, accounts and
data of any nature whatever pertaining to his office.
§ 5-130. Office hours.
The public, administrative and executive business hours shall be open for
the transaction of public business daily, except Saturdays and Sundays and
legal holidays, between such hours as the Council may prescribe, except
as otherwise provided by law. All departments in times of emergency shall
provide municipal services for 24 hours a day. The Administrator or a
department head may require any officer or employee to be in attendance
for work on any day or days whenever he determines that a public exigency
or emergency so requires.
§ 5-131. Residence of officers and employees.
In accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40A:9-138 and N.J.S.A.
40A:9-11, except as otherwise provided by law, department directors may
reside outside the City only with the consent of the Council. As provided
by the cited statutes, any person holding or attempting to hold an office in
violation thereof may be ousted in a proceeding in lieu of prerogative writ.
Members of boards described in Article V shall be residents of the City.
(b) A special service charge of $32 per hour or the actual direct
cost of labor (if less) shall be imposed for each hour of
extraordinary time predicted to be utilized to respond to the
request.
(3) Digital records. If a request for governmental records involves
production or conversion of digital or computerized records or film
which is in a medium not routinely used by the agency (i.e.,
electronic or film); not routinely developed or maintained by an
agency; or requiring a substantial amount of manipulation or
programming of information technology, the requester shall pay
fees and special charges incurred by the City if the conversion is
done directly by the City as follows:
(a) Direct costs (no overhead) to comply with the request; plus
(b) Special charges; the lesser of the cost of technology and labor
actually incurred or $32 per hour.

The following words and phrases, as used in this chapter, shall have the

HEALTH OFFICER — The Health Officer of the City or any of his duly
authorized representatives.
ISOLATION — The physical separation and confinement of an individual or

QUARANTINE — The physical separation and confinement of an individual
or groups of individuals, who are or may have been exposed to a contagious
disease and who do not show signs and symptoms of a contagious disease,
from nonquarantined individuals, to prevent or limit the transmission of the

§ 23-2. Emergency powers.
Whenever the Health Officer finds that public safety will not permit delay,
he may exercise one or more of the following powers without resorting to
legal proceedings and without giving notice of or holding any hearing which
would otherwise be required under any provision of this Code:
A. Condemn any food of a perishable nature and cause to be destroyed or
disposed of in such a manner as to make it impossible thereafter to be
used for human food wherever found:
(1) That the food is exposed or offered for sale or had in possession
with intent to sell in violation of any provision of N.J.S.A. 24:4-1 et
seq.
§ 19-5 PASSAIC CODE § 23-2
23:114
(2) That the food is in a state of rottenness or putrefaction or in any
condition which renders it unwholesome or unfit for use as human
food.
B. To affix to such article a tag to any product, including any food,
cosmetics, drugs or any items intended for human consumption or use,
that is, adulterated or misbranded, until the Health Officer receives
permission from an agent of the State Department or the Court to
remove or dispose of any food, drink, cosmetics, drugs, or other item
intended for human consumption or use which is unwholesome or
dangerous or liable to cause sickness or injury to the persons who
consume it or use it. The tag shall give notice that the article is, or is
suspected of being, adulterated or misbranded and has been detained
and embargoed, and warn all persons not to remove or dispose of such
article by sale or otherwise until permission has been granted from an
agent of the State Department or the Court.
C. Communicable diseases.
(1) Medical examinations, isolation, and quarantine.
(a) Whenever the Health Officer shall deem it necessary to
establish the true character of any disease which in his opinion
may be communicable, a medical examination of the person
infected may be required by a physician designated by the City
of Passaic, and such specimens of excretion or other material
for examination shall be taken from such persons, and it shall
be the duty of the person to submit to the examination and
furnish the necessary specimens. No person shall interfere
with or prevent the securing of such specimens.
(b) The Health Officer may cause any person suspected or known
to be infected with a communicable disease to be isolated or
quarantined until medical or laboratory examinations show
that the person is free of the causative organisms of the
disease.
(c) The Health Officer may, by written order, restrict any person
who has been exposed to a communicable disease, under
conditions he may specify, providing such period of restriction
shall not exceed the period of incubation for the disease.
(2) Carriers.
(a) The Health Officer may, if it shall be deemed necessary, require
a person believed to be a carrier of communicable disease
germs to furnish specimens for examination. It shall be the
duty of such person to furnish the necessary specimens for
examination or to permit the Health Officer or his
representative to collect the specimens.
§ 23-2 HEALTH OFFICER § 23-2
23:115
§ 23-3. Right to inspect premises.
§ 23-4. Notices of violation.
(b) For the purpose of this subsection, all "carriers" shall be
considered as being infected with the disease and shall be
subject to and comply with all provisions of the rules and
regulations of the Division of Health which relate to the
quarantine, isolation and control of persons affected with such
disease.
A. Inspection of premises. The Health Officer shall have the right to
inspect any premises in the City if he has reason to believe that a
provision of this chapter is being violated or as a part of a regular
inspection. No person shall oppose such entry or hinder or interfere
with the Health Officer in the performance of his duty.
B. Search warrant. If the owner or occupant of any premises refuses to
permit entry for the purpose of inspection, the Health Officer may apply
to the Municipal Judge for a search warrant. The application shall be
based on an affidavit setting forth that the inspection is part of a regular
program of inspection or that conditions and circumstances provide a
reasonable basis for believing that a nuisance or unsanitary or
unhealthy condition exists on the premises. If the Municipal Judge is
satisfied that an inspection is necessary, he shall authorize the issuance
of a search warrant permitting access to and inspection of the
premises.
A. Notices of violation of any provision of this chapter or of any ordinance
administered or enforced by the Division of Health shall be issued by
the Health Officer or his designee. Such notice shall contain a brief
statement of the violation charged and, where a structure or premises
or a condition therein is involved, a brief description of the said
structure or premises to which the said notice refers, sufficiently
definite in terms to identify it and its location. Such notice shall direct
the person charged with the violation or his agent to remove the
violation forthwith.
B. The notice of violation may be served upon the person charged with the
violation and who resides in the City of Passaic in person or by leaving it
at his usual place of residence with a member of his family above the
age of 14 years. If the person charged with the violation shall not reside
in the City, then the notice may be served upon him personally or mailed
to his last known residence or business post office address, or it may be
served upon the occupant of the property or upon the agent of the
owner in charge thereof. If the owner of the property is unknown or
service cannot for any reason be made as above directed, notice may be
served by affixing the same in a conspicuous place on the property
where the violation exists and by mailing a copy of the notice to the
§ 23-2 PASSAIC CODE § 23-4
23:116
Chapter 25
INSURANCE
person charged with the violation, to his last known residence or
business address.
C. In cases deemed by the Health Officer to constitute an emergent threat
to public health, the Health Officer may order, by telephone, the owner,
or the owner's agent, or person or persons responsible for the violation
to abate the violation. It shall not be a defense in a Municipal Court
prosecution, where the violation or condition existing on the premises is
of such a nature as to constitute an immediate threat to life or limb or
an emergent threat to the health, safety or welfare of the public, that a
written notice was not served on the defendant if the Health Officer
contacted the owner, or the owner's agent, or person or persons
responsible for the violation by telephone.
D. If no residence or business address or telephone number can be
ascertained by the Health Officer after reasonable diligence for the
owner, or the owner's agent, or person or persons responsible for the
violation, such mailing or telephone call may be dispensed with, and
upon an affidavit of inquiry, the notice of violation shall be deemed
served. Notice to infant owners or owners of unsound mind shall be
served upon their guardians. Where lands are held in trust, service
shall be made upon the trustee. Where lands are held by joint tenants,
tenants in common or tenants by the entirety, service upon one of the
owners shall be sufficient and deemed and taken as notice to all.

The term of the member composing Class I shall correspond with his official
tenure. The terms of the members composing Class II and Class III shall
be for one year or terminate at the completion of their respective terms of
office, whichever occurs first, except for a Class II member who is also a
member of the Environmental Commission. The term of a Class II or a Class
IV member who is also a member of the Environmental Commission shall
be for three years or terminate at the completion of his term of office as a
member of the Environmental Commission, whichever comes first. The term
of a Class IV member who is also a member of the Board of Adjustment or
the Board of Education shall terminate whenever he is no longer a member
of such other body or at the completion of his Class IV term, whichever
occurs first. The terms of all Class IV members first appointed pursuant to
this Part 1 shall be so determined that, to the greatest practicable extent,
the expiration of such term shall be evenly distributed over the first four
years after their appointment as determined by resolution of the governing
body; provided, however, that no term of any member shall exceed four
years and, further, provided that nothing herein shall affect the term of any

term, it shall be filled by appointment as above provided for the
unexpired term. Any member of the Planning Board who shall, during a
calendar year, be absent for three consecutive regularly scheduled
meetings of the Board to which he or she has been appointed shall be
subject to removal by the Mayor and/or City Council in accordance with
the provisions of this section. The Secretary to the Planning Board shall
be required to report to the Mayor and Council three consecutive
absences in the calendar year by any Board member, and when
requested to do by the Mayor and/or Council, the Board member who
missed three consecutive regularly scheduled meetings during the
calendar year shall submit a written explanation for each of his or her
absences. Any Board member may also be removed by the Mayor and/or
Council for cause in accordance with the provisions of this section.

absences are without "reasonable justification" as defined herein, or

the consideration of the City Council to institute removal proceedings.
No member of the Board shall be removed based on his or her absence
at a regularly scheduled meeting where there was a reasonable
justification for the absence. "Reasonable justification" for absence
shall mean illness of the Board member or immediate family member of
the Board member and/or exigent business or personal responsibilities
which render it impracticable for the Board member to be in
attendance. Where the Mayor and/or Council has instituted such
removal proceedings, the proceedings shall be as follows:
(1) A written notice of intention to remove shall be mailed to the Board
member at his or her home address. The notice shall advise the
Board member as to a right to a hearing before the City Council; as
to the right to be represented by counsel; and as to the right to
cross-examine witnesses and present witnesses on his or her
behalf. The notice shall set forth a date for a proposed hearing and
shall notify the Board member that if he or she wishes to contest
the removal, a written notice of intention to contest must be
submitted to the City Clerk at least 10 days prior to the scheduled
hearing. The notice to the Board member shall list the dates of the
regularly scheduled meetings from which the Board member is
alleged to have been absent or shall otherwise set forth the factual
basis for such removal.
(2) The hearing shall be conducted by the City Council in Council
chambers. The Board member shall have a right to participate in
the proceedings, either personally or by counsel, and shall have a
right to examine witnesses and present evidence. Upon conclusion
of all the evidence, the City Council shall make findings of fact and
conclusions as to whether the Board member shall be removed.
C. The Secretary for the Planning Board shall forward the minutes of all
Board meetings to the City Council once approved by the Planning
Board.

determined that, to the greatest practicable extent, the expiration of such
terms shall be distributed, in the case of regular members, evenly over
the first four years after their appointment and in the case of alternate
members, evenly over the first two years after their appointment, provided
that the initial term of no regular members shall exceed four years; and the
term of each alternate member shall be two years.

No. 1859-11]
A. A Board of Adjustment is hereby established pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-69 et seq. consisting of seven regular members and two
alternate members, designated as Alternate No. 1 and Alternate No. 2,
to serve as provided by statute. The seven regular and two alternate
members shall be appointed by the City Council. The regular members
and alternate members shall be residents of the City of Passaic at the
time of their appointments and shall remain bona fide residents during
the term of their appointments. No member may hold any elective office
or position under the municipality. No member of the Board of
Adjustment shall be permitted to act on any matter in which he has,
either directly or indirectly, any personal or financial interest. A
member may, after public hearing, if he requests it, be removed by the
governing body for cause. Alternate members may participate in
discussions of the proceedings but may not vote, except in the absence
or disqualification of a regular member. A vote shall not be delayed in
order that a regular member may vote instead of an alternate member.
In the event that a choice must be made as to which alternate member
is to vote, Alternate No. 1 shall vote. All members shall be deemed
unclassified employees of the City of Passaic and shall receive a salary
of $1 per year and no other compensation or benefit, either directly or

who missed three consecutive regularly scheduled meetings during the
calendar year shall submit a written explanation for each of his or her
absences. Any Board member may also be removed by the Council for
cause in accordance with the provisions of this section.

any appointed Board member, and that the absences are without
"reasonable justification" as defined herein, or that cause otherwise
exists for the removal of such Board member, the Council shall have the
right to introduce a resolution to institute removal proceedings. No
member of the Board shall be removed based on his or her absence at a
regularly scheduled meeting where there was a reasonable justification
for the absence. "Reasonable justification" for absence shall mean
illness of the Board member or immediate family member of the Board
member and/or exigent business or personal responsibilities which
render it impracticable for the Board member to be in attendance.
Where the Council has instituted such removal proceedings, the
proceedings shall be as follows:
(1) A written notice of intention to remove shall be mailed to the Board
member at his or her home address. The notice shall advise the
Board member as to a right to a hearing before the City Council; as
to the right to be represented by counsel; and as to the right to
cross-examine witnesses and present witnesses on his or her
behalf. The notice shall set forth a date for a proposed hearing and

alleged to have been absent or shall otherwise set forth the factual
basis for such removal.
(2) The hearing shall be conducted by the City Council in Council
chambers. The Board member shall have a right to participate in
the proceedings, either personally or by counsel, and shall have a
right to examine witnesses and present evidence. Upon conclusion
of all the evidence, the City Council shall make findings of fact and
conclusions as to whether the Board member shall be removed.

A. Basic powers. The powers of the Board of Adjustment shall be in
accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq. and amendments and
supplements thereto, and with the provisions of this Part 1. The Board
of Adjustment shall have such powers as are granted by law to:
(1) Hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that
there is error in any order, requirement, decision or refusal made
by an administrative official or agency based on or made in the
enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance.48
(2) Hear and decide requests for interpretations of the map or Zoning
Ordinance, or for decisions upon other special questions upon
which such Board is authorized by the Zoning Ordinance to pass.
(3) Variances:
(a) Where, by reasons of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or
shape of a specific piece of property, or by reason of
exceptional topographic conditions of physical features
uniquely affecting a specific piece of property, or by reason of
an extraordinary and exceptional situation uniquely affecting a
specific piece of property or the structures lawfully existing
thereon, the strict application of any regulation pursuant to the
Zoning Ordinance and N.J.S.A. 40:55D-62 through 55D-68
would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties
to, or exceptional and undue hardship upon, the developer of
such property, grant, upon an application or an appeal relating
to such property, a variance from such strict application of
such regulation so as to release such difficulties or hardship.
(b) Where, in an application or appeal relating to a specific piece
of property, the purposes of this Act would be advanced by a
deviation from the Zoning Ordinance requirements and the
benefits of the deviation would substantially outweigh any

detriment, grant a variance to allow departure from
regulations of the Zoning Ordinance; provided, however, that
no variance from those departures enumerated in Subsection
A(4) of this section shall be granted under this subsection
and provided, further, that the proposed development does not
require approval by the Planning Board of a subdivision, site
plan or conditional use in conjunction with which the Planning
Board has power to review a request for a variance pursuant
to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-60a.
(4) In particular cases and for special reasons, grant a variance to
allow departure from regulations pursuant to Article 8 of N.J.S.A.
40:55D-1 et seq. to permit a use or principal structure in a district
restricted against such use or principal structure; an expansion of a
nonconforming use; deviation from a specification or standard
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-67 pertaining solely to a conditional
use; an increase in the permitted floor area ratio as defined in
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-4; and an increase in the permitted density as
defined in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-4, except as applied to the required lot
area for a lot or lots for detached one- or two-family dwelling unit
buildings, which lot or lots are either an isolated undersized lot or
lots resulting from a minor subdivision. A variance under this
subsection shall be granted only by affirmative vote of at least five
members of the Board. No variance or other relief may be granted
under the terms of this Subsection A(4), unless such variance or
other relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the
public good and will not substantially impair the intent and the
purpose of the zone plan and Zoning Ordinance. An application
under this subsection may be referred to any appropriate person or
agency for its report, provided that such reference shall not extend
the period of time within which the Board of Adjustment shall act.
B. Additional powers. Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-76, the Board of
Adjustment shall in addition to the powers specified in § 29-13A of this
article have power given by law to:

building or structure in the bed of a mapped street or public
drainageway, flood control basin or public area reserved on the
Official Map.
(2) Direct issuance of a permit pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-36 for a
building or structure not related to a street.
(3) The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to grant to the same
extent and subject to the same restrictions as the Planning Board
subdivision or site plan approval pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-37
through 55D-59, whenever the Board is reviewing an application
for approval of a use variance pursuant to Article II, § 29-13A(4) of

developer may elect to submit a separate application requesting
approval of the variance and a subsequent application for any
required approval of a subdivision, site plan or conditional use. The
separate approval of the variance shall be conditioned upon grant
of all required subsequent approvals by the Board of Adjustment.
No such subsequent approval shall be granted unless such
approval can be granted without substantial detriment to the public
good and without substantial impairment of the intent and purpose
of the zone plan and Zoning Ordinance. The number of votes of
Board members required to grant any such subsequent approval
shall be as otherwise provided in this Part 1 and the Municipal
Land Use Law, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq., for the approval in
question, and the special vote pursuant to the aforesaid Subsection
A(4) of § 29-13 shall not be required.

Adjustment may be taken by an interested party affected by any
decision of an administrative officer of the municipality based on or
made in the enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance49 or Official Map.

§ 29-23. Hearings.
§ 29-24. Decisions.
A. Rules. The Planning Board and Zoning Board of Adjustment may make
rules governing the conduct of hearings before such bodies, which rules
shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq.
or of this Part 1.
B. Oaths. The officer presiding at the hearing or such persons as he may
designate shall have the power to administer oaths and issue subpoenas
to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant
evidence, including witnesses and documents presented by the parties,
and the provisions of the County and Municipal Investigations Law, P.L.
1953, c. 1938 (N.J.S.A. 2A:67A-1 et seq.), shall apply.
C. Testimony. The testimony of all witnesses relating to an application for
development shall be taken under oath or affirmation by the presiding

thereon in each decision on any application for development and shall
§ 29-21 PASSAIC CODE § 29-24
25:140
reduce the decision to writing. The Board shall provide the findings and
conclusions through:
(1) A resolution adopted at a meeting held within the time provided in
the Municipal Land Use Law for the action by the Board on the
application for development; or
(2) A memorializing resolution adopted at a meeting held not later
than 45 days after the date of the meeting at which the municipal
agency voted to grant or deny approval. Only the members of the
municipal agency who voted for the action taken may vote on the
memorializing resolution, and the vote of a majority of such
members present at the meeting at which the resolution is
presented for adoption shall be sufficient to adopt the resolution.
An action pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-9 (resulting from the failure
of a motion to approve an application) shall be memorialized by
resolution as provided above, with those members voting against
the motion for approval being the members eligible to vote on the
memorializing resolution. The vote on any such resolution shall be
deemed to be a memorialization of the action of the Board and not
to be an action of the Board; however, the date of the adoption of
the resolution shall constitute the date of the decision for the
purposes of the mailings, filings and publications required by
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-10h and 55D-10i. If the Board fails to adopt the
resolution or memorializing resolutions as here and above
specified, any interested party may apply to the Superior Court in a
summary manner for an order compelling the Board to reduce its
findings and conclusion to writing within a stated time, and the cost
of the application, including attorney's fees, shall be assessed
against the municipality.

administrative officer within 10 days of the date of decision to the
applicant or, if represented, then to his attorney, without separate
charge. A copy of the decision shall also be mailed to all persons who
have requested it and who have paid the fee prescribed by the Board for
such service. A copy of the decision shall also be filed in the office of the
Municipal Clerk, who shall make a copy of such filed decision available
to any interested party upon payment of a fee calculated in the same
manner as those established for copies of other public documents in the
municipality.
C. Publication of decision. A brief notice of every final decision shall be
published in the official newspaper of the municipality. Such publication
shall be arranged by the administrative officer. Said notice shall be sent
to the official newspaper for publication within 10 days of the date of
any such decision. The municipality may make a reasonable charge for
the publication.

ARTICLE IV
Application Procedures
§ 29-26. Applicability; word usage.
§ 29-27. Minor subdivisions.
A. The procedures set down in this article apply to applications to the
Planning Board and the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
B. As used in this article, the term "Board" refers to the Planning Board
and the Zoning Board of Adjustment acting pursuant to the Municipal
Land Use Law, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq.
A. Definition. "Minor subdivision" shall be any subdivision of land which
does not involve the creation or reassembly of more than three lots;
which does not involve planned development; which does not involve
any new street; and which does not involve the extension of any off-tract
improvements.
B. Waiver of notice and hearing. The Board may waive notice and public
hearing of an application for development if the Board, or Subdivision
Committee in the case of the Planning Board, finds that the application
for development conforms to the definition of "minor subdivision" set
forth in § 29-27A of this article.
C. Approval. Minor subdivision approval shall be deemed to be final
approval of the subdivision by the Board, provided that the Board or
said subcommittee may condition such approval on terms ensuring the
provision of improvements pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-38, 55D-39,
55D-40 and N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53. Minor subdivision approval shall be
granted or denied within the time limits established for this purpose in
§ 29-33 of this article. Approval of a minor subdivision shall expire 190
days from the date of Board approval unless, within such period, a plat
in conformity with such approval and the provisions of the Map Filing
Law51 or a deed clearly describing the approved minor subdivision is
filed by the developer with the county recording officer, the Municipal
Engineer and the Municipal Tax Assessor. Any such plat or deed must
be signed by the Chairman and Secretary of the Board before it will be
accepted for filing by the county recording officer. In reviewing the
application for development for a proposed minor subdivision, the
Board may accept a plat not in conformity with the Map Filing Act, P.L.
1969, c. 141 (N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq.); provided that, if the developer
chooses to file the minor subdivision as provided herein by plat rather
than deed, such plat shall conform with the provisions of said act. The
zoning requirements and general terms and conditions, whether
conditional or otherwise, upon which minor subdivision approval was
granted, shall not be changed for a period of two years after the date of

minor subdivision approval, provided that the approved minor
subdivision shall have been duly recorded.
A. Definition. "Major subdivision" is any subdivision of land which is not
classified as a minor subdivision.
B. Notice and hearing. For all major subdivisions, the Board shall hold a
public hearing with public notice given by publication in the official
newspaper of the municipality, if there be one, or in a newspaper of
general circulation in the municipality, and a notice of the hearing shall
be given to the owners of all real property as shown on the current tax
duplicate, located within 200 feet in all directions of the property which
is the subject of such hearing and to other persons as required by
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-12 and following the procedures set forth in N.J.S.A.
40:55D-12 and § 29-37 of this article.
C. Improvements. As a condition of subdivision approval, the approving
authority may require the installation and maintenance of on-tract
improvements, and the regulations may require a developer to pay his
pro rata share of the cost of off-tract improvements in accordance with
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-42.
D. Preliminary approval. Upon submission of a complete application for a
major subdivision, the Board shall grant or deny preliminary approval
within the time limits established for this purpose in § 29-33 of this
article. The developer shall submit to the administrative officer a plat
and such other information as is reasonably necessary to make an
informed decision as to whether the requirements necessary for
preliminary approval, as set forth in this Part 1, the Zoning Ordinance
and the Land Subdivision Ordinance have been met, provided that
minor subdivisions pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-47 shall not be subject
to this section. The plat and any other engineering documents to be
submitted shall be required in tentative form for discussion purposes
for preliminary approval. If the Board required any substantial
amendment in the layout of improvements proposed by the developer
that have been the subject of a hearing, an amended application shall
be submitted and proceeded upon, as in the case of the original
application for development. The Board shall, if the proposed
subdivision complies with the Land Subdivision Ordinance52 and
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq., grant preliminary approval to the subdivision.
E. Final subdivision approval. Before consideration of a final subdivision
plat, the Board shall require the posting of adequate performance
guaranties to assure the installation of the improvements required by
the Board pursuant to Article VII of the Land Subdivision Ordinance of
Passaic, or the subdivider shall have installed the improvements. The
Board shall also require the posting of adequate maintenance

guaranties. Application for final subdivision approval shall be granted
or denied within the time limits established for this purpose in § 29-33
of this Part 1. The Board shall grant final approval, if the detailed
drawings, specifications and estimates of the application for final
approval conform to the standards established by ordinance for final
approval, the conditions of preliminary approval and, in the case of a
major subdivision, the standards prescribed by the Map Filing Law, P.L.
1960, c. 141 (N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq.); provided that, in the case of
a planned unit development, planned unit residential development or
residential cluster, the Board may permit minimal deviations from the
conditions of preliminary approval necessitated by change of conditions
beyond the control of the developer, since the date of preliminary
approval without the developer being required to submit another
application for development for preliminary approval. Final approval of
a major subdivision shall expire 95 days from the date of signing of
the plat, unless, within such period, the plat shall have been duly filed
by the developer with the county recording officer. The Board may, for
good cause shown, extend the period for recording for an additional
period not to exceed 190 days from the date of signing of the plat.
A. Procedure for preliminary site plan approval.
(1) The developer shall submit to the administrative officer a site plan
and such other information as is reasonably necessary to make an
informed decision as to whether the requirements necessary for
preliminary site plan approval have been met. The site plan and any
engineering documents to be submitted shall be required in
tentative form for discussion purposes for preliminary approval. If
any architectural plans are required to be submitted for site plan
approval, the preliminary site plans and elevations shall be
sufficient. Any such architectural plans and/or surveys required to
be submitted shall expressly identify all structures of any kind on
the property at the time of the application. [Amended 1-6-2003
by Ord. No. 1556-02]
(2) If the Board requires any substantial amendment in the layout of
improvements proposed by the developer that have been the
subject of a hearing, an amended application for development shall
be submitted and proceeded upon as in the case of the original
application for development. The Board shall, if the proposed
development complies with this Part 1, the Zoning Ordinance53 and
the Municipal Land Use Law,54 grant preliminary site plan
approval.
(3) Upon the submission to the administrative officer of a complete
application for a site plan, preliminary approval shall be granted or

B. Procedure for final site plan approval. The Board shall grant final
approval, if the detailed drawings, specifications and estimates of the
application for final approval conform to the standards established by
ordinance for final approval and provided the conditions of preliminary
approval are met. Final approval shall be granted or denied within the
time limits established for this purpose in § 29-33 of this article.
A. Effect of preliminary approval of a subdivision or site plan. Preliminary
approval of a major subdivision or of a site plan shall, except as
provided in Subsection A(4) of this section, confer upon the applicant
the following rights for a three-year period from the date of the
preliminary approval:
(1) The general terms and conditions, upon which the preliminary
approval was granted, shall not be changed, including but not
limited to use requirements, layout and design standards for
streets, curbs and sidewalks, lot size, yard dimensions and off-tract
improvements and, in the case of a site plan, any requirements
peculiar to site plan approval, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-41,
except that nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the
municipality from modifying by ordinance such general terms and
conditions of preliminary approval as relate to public health and
safety.
(2) The applicant may submit for final approval on or before the
expiration date of preliminary approval the whole or a section or
sections of the preliminary subdivision plat or site plan, as the case
may be.
(3) The applicant may apply for and the Board may grant extensions on
such preliminary approval for additional periods of at least one
year, but not to exceed a total extension of two years, provided that,
if the design standards have been revised by ordinance, such
revised standards may govern.
(4) In the case of a subdivision of or site plan for an area of 50 acres or
more, the Board may grant the rights referred to in Subsection
A(1), (2) and (3) above for such period of time, longer than three
years, as shall be determined by the Board to be reasonable, taking
into consideration the number of dwelling units and nonresidential
floor area permissible under preliminary approval; economic
conditions; and the comprehensiveness of the development. The
applicant may apply for thereafter and the Board may thereafter
grant an extension to preliminary approval for such additional
period of time as shall be determined by the Board to be
reasonable, taking into consideration the number of dwelling units

and nonresidential floor area permissible under preliminary
approval; and the potential number of dwelling units and
nonresidential floor area of the section or sections awaiting final
approval; economic conditions; and the comprehensiveness of the
development, provided that, if the design standards have been
revised, such revised standards may govern.
B. Effect of final approval of a subdivision or site plan.
(1) The zoning requirements applicable to the preliminary approval
first granted and all other rights conferred upon the developer
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-49, whether conditionally or otherwise,
shall not be changed for a period of two years after the date of final
approval; provided that, in the case of major subdivision, the rights
conferred by this section shall expire if the plat has not been duly
recorded within the time period provided in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-54. If
the developer has followed the standards prescribed for final
approval and, in the case of a subdivision, has duly recorded the
plat as required in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-54, the Board may extend such
period or protection for extensions of one year, but not to exceed
three extensions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Part
1, the granting of final approval terminates the time period of
preliminary approval for the section granted final approval.
(2) In the case of a subdivision or site plan for a planned unit
development or planned unit residential development or residential
cluster of 50 acres or more or conventional subdivision or site plan
for 150 acres or more, the Board may grant the rights referred to in
Subsection B(1) of this section for such period of time, longer than
two years, as shall be determined by the Board to be reasonable,
taking into consideration the number of dwelling units and
nonresidential floor area permissible under final approval;
economic conditions; and the comprehensiveness of the
development. The developer may apply for thereafter and the
Board may thereafter grant an extension of final approval for such
additional period of time as shall be determined by the Board to be
reasonable, taking into consideration the number of dwelling units
and nonresidential floor area permissible under final approval; the
number of dwelling units and nonresidential floor area remaining
to be developed; economic conditions; and the comprehensiveness
of the development.

Artists' Certification Board58
[Added 3-5-1998 by Ord. No. 1435-98]
§ 29-49. Creation of Board; purpose.
There is hereby created an Artists' Certification Board (ACB), which shall
serve as a citizens' advisory board to the Planning Board, pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-27a. The ACB is essentially an artists' peer review
committee. In order to reside in the Work and live artist studio (WALAS), an
artist must be so certified by the Planning Board. The Planning Board shall
be guided in this certification by the recommendation made by the ACB. The
Planning Board may reject the recommendation of the ACB, but the reasons
for such rejection must be clearly stated by the Board.
§ 29-50. Composition; appointment; terms.
The ACB shall be comprised of persons knowledgeable in the arts. It shall
consist of three full members, with no more than one additional alternate
member who may vote in the absence of full members. A minimum of two
full members of the ACB shall be professional artists. All members shall be
appointed by the Mayor. The initial appointments shall be for varying terms
of one or two years in order to stagger the expiration of terms. One member
shall be initially appointed to a one-year term, and two members shall be
appointed to two-year terms. One alternate shall be initially appointed to a
two-year term. After the initial appointments are made, all terms shall run
for two years.
§ 29-51. Review of applications.
The ACB shall review applications filed by persons who are interested in
occupying space in the WALAS as either owners, tenants or subtenants, to
determine if the applicant can be certified to occupy such space.
§ 29-52. Criteria for certification.
A. The following shall serve as criteria to be used by the ACB in certifying
an artist:
(1) The artist's commitment to the fine arts as a career.
(2) The need for large loft space in which to create his or her art.
(3) Education.
(4) Current body of work.
(5) Exhibition record.
(6) References from other artists or art professionals.

the reasons for the decision with specific reference to one or more of the
criteria set forth in § 29-52 above.
§ 29-54. Certification of artist; expiration of certification.
Once an artist is certified by the Planning Board, the Planning Board shall
forward a copy of its certification decision to the Director of Housing
Inspection, who shall retain the certification in the Director of Housing
Inspection files. The certification shall expire five years after the date of the
decision by the Planning Board. Renewal applications may be filed.

determine eligibility to occupy work/live space in the WALAS.

lease real property, constructed off-site improvements, constructed
replacement parking facilities, etc., the City Council, in its sole
discretion, may credit the applicant with the reasonable value of such

ARTICLE IV
Antiharassment Policy
[Adopted 9-23-2002 by Ord. No. 1550-02]
§ 35-6. Policy.
The City of Passaic (hereinafter referred to as the "City") has a strong
commitment to provide a work environment free from unlawful harassment
based on sex, affectional or sexual orientation, race, color, religion, national
origin, age, disability, ancestry, atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait
(AHCBT), liability for service in the Armed Forces of the United States,
creed, handicap, marital status, familial status, genetic information, refusal
to submit to genetic testing, refusal to provide genetic information, or
nationality of that person or that person's spouse, partners, members,
officers, managers, superintendents, agents, employees, business
associates, suppliers, or customers (collectively, the "protected
classifications"). The City will not tolerate unlawful harassment. Acts or
incidents of unlawful harassment should be promptly reported in
accordance with the procedures outlined below. The City will promptly
investigate all reports of unlawful harassment. Employees who violate this
policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination
from employment. Employees who violate this policy also risk personal legal
liability.
§ 35-7. Purpose.
The purpose of this policy is to ensure all employees of the City of Passaic
a work environment free of any type of unlawful discrimination, including
freedom from harassment on the basis of any protected classification.
§ 35-8. Improper conduct.
Instances that may violate the City's policy against harassment and which
may result in disciplinary action include the following:
A. Unwelcome remarks and actions based on the protected classifications.
This may include, but is not limited to, inappropriate jokes, comments
or posted materials.
B. Threats or suggestions that an employee's employment work status will
be adversely affected based upon the protected classifications.
C. Affecting or denying employment opportunities or benefits to an
employee based upon the protected classifications.
D. Engaging in a negative tangible employment action based upon the
protected classifications.
E. Retaliation against an employee who has reported any alleged violation
of this policy or participated in an investigation related to this policy.
§ 35-6 (RESERVED) § 35-9
32:185
§ 35-9. Sexual harassment.
§ 35-10. Supervisory personnel.
Special care must be exercised by supervisors and managers whose actions
or remarks may be mistakenly perceived as unlawful harassment. The
subordinate may feel inhibited and may not disclose the unwelcome actions
or remarks by the supervisor or person of higher rank. Unlawful harassment
is not limited, however, to employees of different rank.
§ 35-11. Complaint procedure.
Any employee who feels he or she has been subject to harassment or has
knowledge of a violation of this policy should report the incident directly to
the Business Administrator or his/her designee. The Business Administrator
or his/her designee is hereby designated as the harassment officer. If
circumstances prevent reporting the incident directly to the Business
Administrator or his/her designee, the employee should report the incident
to the employee's department head. The Business Administrator or his/her
designee must be promptly advised of such complaint. If the complaint
involves a direct supervisor, the employee is not required to complain to
that direct supervisor. The complaint should then be made to any of the
other above mentioned individuals. A complaint of harassment shall be
investigated by the Business Administrator or his/her designee in a timely
manner.
A. An important note must be made with respect to sexual harassment.
Sexual harassment is defined as any unwelcome advance or request for
sexual favors or any conduct of a sexual nature where:
(1) Submission is made explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of
employment; or
(2) Submission to or rejection of harassing conduct or communication
is used, or is threatened to be used, as the basis of employment
decisions; or
(3) Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual's work or creates an intimidating, hostile, or
offensive working environment.
B. Sexual harassment is different from sexual attraction or flirtation.
Sexual harassment is unwelcome sexual attention which is demeaning
and causes the recipient distress. Sexual harassment does not refer to
occasional inoffensive compliments. However, comments or behavior
which may be intended to be complimentary may be viewed by the
recipient as unwelcome and a form of sexual harassment.
A. The complaint filed must include the following information:
(1) The name and department of the complainant;
§ 35-9 PASSAIC CODE § 35-11
32:186
§ 35-12. Investigation procedure.
§ 35-13. Privacy.
§ 35-14. City liability.
(2) The name and department of the charged party;
(3) The nature and circumstances, in detail, of the alleged harassment,
including but not limited to the injuries or consequences suffered
by the complainant, the names of any witnesses to such actions and
the duration of the actions questioned; and
(4) Whether such harassment has been previously reported to a
supervisor or other person, and if so, when and to whom.
B. Nothing in this section shall prevent the complainant from providing
other information or documents he/she believes are essential to the fair
adjudication of their case.
C. The initial complaint may be made orally or in writing. If the complaint
is made orally, the Business Administrator or his/her designee shall
reduce same to a written document, which shall, if it is deemed
accurate, be signed by the complainant. If an individual is
uncomfortable in making a written complaint, the City may proceed
with its investigation without a formal, written complaint.
A. Once a complaint has been registered or a harassment situation has
become known to the City, a prompt and thorough investigation will be
conducted to determine the meritorious character of the complaint.
B. If the City determines that unlawful harassment has occurred in
violation of this policy, the individual who engaged in such harassing
conduct shall face immediate and appropriate disciplinary action based
upon the severity of the complaint and any prior history of past charges
made against the individual and disciplinary action involving the
individual. Disciplinary action may include being suspended without
pay pending the hearing, a written warning, suspension, demotion, and/
or termination of employment.
A. The City of Passaic encourages victims of harassment to bring their
complaints to management by ensuring that no reprisals or retaliation
will result against such complaining individual as a result of the good
faith reporting of harassment. In addition, anyone who assists in the
filing of a complaint or in the investigation of a claim of harassment will
be protected from reprisals and retaliation. Reprisal or retaliation may
be the basis of a separate complaint, even if the complaint of
harassment may be found to be without merit.
B. To the fullest extent possible, and so long as it does not inhibit the
conducting of an investigation, all persons involved with a harassment
complaint will be given the utmost protection of privacy.
§ 35-11 (RESERVED) § 35-14
32:187
§ 35-15. False accusations.
Since a charge of harassment is a grave and serious one, false accusations
of harassment are, and will be treated as, a disciplinary offense and will
result in a level of punishment appropriate for a person engaging in such
behavior.
A. Because the City of Passaic prohibits harassment of its employees in
any form, any individual charged with harassment in a civil action or by
way of an administrative complaint shall be solely responsible for
paying all costs of defense and/or any damages resulting therefrom
which are awarded by any proper court of law or after an administrative
hearing.
B. Any employee with questions regarding the City's Harassment Policy
may contact the Business Administrator or his/her designee.

potentially dangerous dog license, municipal registration
number and red identification tag issued pursuant to this act.

dogs shall be confined in the enclosure or, if taken out of the
enclosure, securely muzzled and restrained with a tether
approved by the animal control office and having a minimum

restrict the potentially dangerous dog's movements to a radius
of no more than three feet from the owner and under the direct
supervision of the owner.

schedule of these costs and expenses. The owner shall incur the
expense of impounding the dog in a facility other than the
municipal pound, regardless of whether the dog is ultimately found
to be vicious or potentially dangerous.

furnishings, furniture, equipment, facilities and improvements connected

dwelling which opens directly to the exterior of the premises by way
of a common hallway, common areaway or common stairway or door to the
exterior of the premises without passing through any other rooming unit or

General Provisions
§ 143-1. Statutory authority.
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et seq.
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general
welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Passaic of
New Jersey does ordain as follows.
§ 143-2. Findings of fact.
§ 143-3. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. The flood hazard areas of the City of Passaic are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities
and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected
from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and

relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to the Federal Insurance Administration; and
(2) Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse so the flood carrying capacity
is not diminished.
E. Interpretation of firm boundaries. Make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood
hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting
the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
appeal the interpretation as provided in § 143-15.

which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
§ 143-14 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION § 143-15
143:451
(g) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
(h) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program of that area;
(i) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(j) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave
action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
(k) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water

(6) The City Engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions,
including technical information, and report any variances to the
Federal Insurance Administration upon request.
B. Conditions for variances.
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items
in § 143-15A(4)(a) through (k) have been fully considered. As the lot
size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as an historic structure and the variance is the
minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design
of the structure.
(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
§ 143-15 PASSAIC CODE § 143-15
143:452
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
or extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud
on or victimization of the public as identified in § 143-15A(4),
or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

improvements, and other development, unless a technical evaluation
demonstrates that encroachment shall not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
B. If § 143-18A is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements must comply with § 143-16 and 143-17, provisions for
flood hazard reduction.
§ 143-17 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION § 143-18
143:457
§ 143-19. Fee.
There is hereby established a fee of $10 for the distribution of floodplain
information. The City Engineer shall be authorized to charge and collect
said fee for each request.

PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
GENERAL REFERENCES
General penalty — See Ch. 1, Art. II.
§ 199-1. Findings.
The governing body finds that offenses against the laws of the United
States, the laws of the State of New Jersey and the ordinances of the
City of Passaic by minors under the age of 18 years are increasing at an
alarming rate; that in a great many cases a lack of proper supervision and
control of the minor child by his parents or guardians is evident; and that
the increasing problem of criminal and quasi-criminal offenses by children
will not be solved by sanctions imposed upon the children alone, but it
is necessary that sanctions be imposed upon parents or guardians whose
neglect of their duty to properly supervise and control their children is a
direct and proximate cause of the delinquency of those children.
§ 199-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
MINOR — Any unemancipated person under the age of 18 years.
PARENT — Includes either or both natural parents of a minor, the legal
guardians of such minor or any other adult persons who have voluntarily or
otherwise assumed the responsibilities of a natural parent with respect to
custody, care and control of said minor. For the purposes of the enforcement
of this chapter, the term "parent" shall not apply to natural parents, legal
guardians or other persons whose responsibility for the custody and control
of such minor has been transferred to another person or terminated by
court order or by the emancipation of said minor by marriage, military
services or other circumstances. Persons claiming the benefit of any such
termination or transfer of responsibilities shall bear the burden of
establishing the same in any proceedings hereunder.
VIOLATION OF THE PUBLIC PEACE — Includes any of the following acts:
defacing, damaging or destroying public property or the private property
of another within the City of Passaic; knowingly receiving stolen property;
breaking and entering or entering without breaking into the property of
another with the intent to steal; threatening another with the intention of
extorting money or anything of value; possession and/or use of a controlled
dangerous substance, as same shall be defined under Title 24 of the Revised
Statutes of New Jersey; or juvenile delinquency based upon any of the above
offenses.
§ 197-9 PASSAIC CODE § 199-3
199:600
§ 199-3. Unlawful to contribute to misconduct of minor.
It shall be unlawful for any parent to assist, aid, abet, allow, permit or
encourage a minor to commit a violation of the public peace, as defined
herein, either by overt act, by failure to act or by lack of supervision and
control over such minor. Whenever a minor shall be arrested or detained for
the commission of any such violation of the public peace within the City of
Passaic and said violation of the public peace was substantially contributed
to by the failure of the parent to supervise the minor child or in any way
to assist, aid, abet, allow, permit, suffer or encourage the minor to commit
the violation of public peace, constituting a contribution to the cause of the
juvenile misconduct, it shall be deemed as a violation of this chapter.130
§ 199-4. Additional remedies.
The remedy provisions of this chapter shall be cumulative, not exclusive,
and the state or any other agency or person shall have the right to proceed
under any other legally available remedies.

General Provisions
§ 219-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Property Maintenance Code of the City
of Passaic," and may be referred to in this chapter in the short form as "this
code."
§ 219-2. Findings.
§ 219-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this code is to protect the public health, safety, morals and
welfare by establishing minimum standards governing the maintenance,
appearance, condition and occupancy of dwelling units and nonresidential
premises; to establish minimum standards governing utilities, facilities and
other physical components and conditions essential to making the aforesaid
facilities fit for human habitation, occupancy and use; to fix certain
A. It is hereby found and declared that there exist in the City of Passaic
structures used for residential and nonresidential use which are or may
become in the future substandard with respect to structure, equipment
and/or maintenance or further that such conditions, including, but not
limited to, structural deterioration, lack of maintenance and
appearance of exterior of premises, infestation, lack of essential
heating, plumbing, lack of maintenance or upkeep of essential utilities
and facilities, existence of fire hazards, inadequate provisions for light
and air, insanitary conditions and overcrowding, constitute a menace to
the health, safety, morals, welfare and reasonable comfort of the
citizens and inhabitants of the City of Passaic. It is further found and
declared that, by reason of lack of maintenance and progressive
deterioration, certain properties have the further effect of creating
blighting conditions and initiating slums and that, if the same are not
curtailed and removed, the aforesaid conditions will grow and spread
and will necessitate in time the expenditure of large amounts of public
funds to correct and eliminate the same and that, by reason of timely
regulations and restrictions as herein contained, the growth of slums
and blight may be prevented and the neighborhood and property values
thereby maintained, the desirability and amenities of residential and
nonresidential uses and neighborhoods enhanced and the public health,
safety and welfare protected and fostered.
B. It is further found and declared that, by reason of the peculiar and
special conditions existing in lodging houses, the licensing and
regulation of same is necessary so that the aforesaid regulations may be
better enforced in the public interest for the protection of health, safety
and welfare of the public to prevent slum and blighted conditions from
expanding in the City of Passaic and for the social and economic
stability of the city.

across adjoining premises to permit repairs; and to provide for the repair,
demolition or vacation of premises unfit for human habitation or occupancy
or use. This code is hereby declared to be remedial and essential for the
public interest, and it is intended that this code be liberally construed to
effectuate the purposes as stated herein.

The heating facilities and all parts thereof shall be kept in good
operating condition, free of defects, corrosion and deterioration at all
times.

exhaust the products of combustion to the outside air; to prevent a fire
hazard by being sufficiently removed or insulated from surrounding
material; to be permanently affixed so that the heater cannot be moved
by occupants; and not to constitute a hazard to persons using the
premises in close proximity to the heater by reason of chance contact or
by reason of lack of fresh air supply.
C. Space heaters shall be installed in such a manner that all habitable
rooms will be heated to the required temperature, with no room more
than 5° F. higher in temperature than the other rooms. If the
temperature varies over 5° F., other heaters must be installed to give

Any owner or operator who has an express contractual arrangement with
an occupant, under which the occupant undertakes to supply his own heat
through facilities under the occupant's exclusive control, shall be excluded
from the requirements to supply heat hereunder.
§ 219-52. Duty to maintain heating unit.
Notwithstanding a contract by the occupant to supply his own heat as
provided herein, where the heating unit is installed by or owned by the
owner or operator, then the duty to maintain said heating unit in operable
and functioning condition shall remain the duty of the owner or operator.
A. In adopting this amendment, the City Council wishes to make it
incontravertably clear that it considers continuous provision of
adequate heat of paramount importance and that even due diligence to
prevent or repair breakdowns does not exempt rental property owners
and operators from whatever alternative effort and expense is
necessary to maintain such continuous heat.
B. The City Council further states its intentions that this section of the
code stand on its own and that proof that heat did not meet the required
levels is, ipso facto, proof that a violation of § 219-49 has occurred,
notwithstanding the cause of such lack of heat nor any effort of building
owner or operator to abate such violation.

failed to register the premises as required under Ordinance No. 162-72 or
A. The notice shall specify the violation or violations committed, what
must be done to correct the same and a reasonable time period to
correct or abate the violation or violations. For the purpose of this
section, a "reasonable time" shall mean the time actually required to do
the necessary work, and it shall not be a defense in a Municipal Court
proceeding that an owner or operator was unable to obtain the services
of a contractor or tradesman unless such owner or operator has
requested an extension from the Housing Officer according to
§ 219-156 hereunder.
B. In cases deemed by the Housing Officer to constitute an emergent
threat to life, limb, public health, safety or welfare or to property or
cases which create an uninhabitable condition in one or more rooms in
any dwelling unit, the Housing Officer may reasonably order by
telegram, mailgram or telephone call to the owner or his agent that
steps to abate the violation be taken within 24 hours of said notice.

§ 219-154. Notice to become order unless hearing requested.
Within 10 days of the date of service of a notice, the notice shall constitute
a final order unless any person affected by the notice requests a hearing
thereon, serves a written request within the ten-day period in person or by
mail the Housing Officers. Such request for a hearing shall set forth briefly
the grounds or reasons on which the request for a hearing is based and the
factual matters contained in the notice of violation which are to be disputed
at the hearing. The Housing Officer, upon receipt of the request, shall,
within 30 days therefrom and upon five days' notice to the party aggrieved,
set the matter down for hearing.
§ 219-155. Hearing; determination.
At any hearing provided hereunder the Housing Officer shall be vested
with all powers provided by law to compel the attendance of witnesses
and parties in interest by issuance and service of subpoena, to require by
subpoena the production of books, records or other documents at any such
hearing which may be pertinent to matters to be determined by him and
to enforce any such subpoena or secure any order for the enforcement of
any such subpoena as provided by law. Determination shall be made within
10 days from the completion of the hearing. The Housing Officer shall issue
an order either incorporating the determination and directions contained in
the notice, modifying the same or withdrawing the notice.
A. It shall be the responsibility of the owner of any real property in the City
of Passaic or his/her agent to maintain current the owner's address with
the City of Passaic by filing a change-of-address notice with the Tax
Assessor whenever required as a result of such change on the part of
the owner. Failure to have changed one's address on the records of the
Tax Assessor shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter.
B. Where an owner of real property in the City of Passaic is required to file
landlord registration certificates with the City of Passaic, it shall be the
obligation of such owner to notify the Department of Community
Development of any change in address or telephone number within 10
days of any such change. Failure to do so shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter.

§ 219-156. Extension of time for correction.
The Housing Officer may extend the time for correction or abatement of the
violations for an additional period of time with justification of such delay
only after a request is made in writing.
§ 219-157. Abatement of emergency conditions.
A. Where the violation or condition existing on the premises are of such a
nature as to constitute an immediate threat to life and limb unless
abated without delay, the Housing Officer may either abate the violation
or condition immediately or order the owner, operator or occupant to
correct the violation or condition within a period of time not to exceed
three days, and upon failure to do so, the Housing Officer shall abate
the condition immediately thereafter. In either case, the cost of
abatement shall be the obligation of the owner, operator or occupant, as
determined by the Housing Officer, and such costs shall be reimbursed
to the city. Failure to discharge the obligation within 30 days after
notification shall be a violation of this chapter and shall subject the
owner, operator or occupant to the penalties thereof, in addition to such
other recourse as the City may pursue to recover said costs. [Amended
8-9-1984 by Ord. No. 795-84]
B. The amount of the filing of legal papers, expert witnesses, fees, search
fees and advertising charges incurred in the course of any proceeding
taken under this act determined in favor of the municipality and such
cost of such repairs, alterations or improvements or vacating and
closing or removal or demolition, if any, or the amount of the balance
thereof remaining after deduction of the sum of any realized from the
sale of materials derived from such building or from any contract for
removal or demolition thereof shall be a municipal lien against the real
property upon which such cost was incurred. If the building is removed
or demolished by the public officer, he shall sell the materials of such
building. There shall be credited against the cost of the removal or
demolition thereof the proceeds of any sale of such materials or any
sum derived from any contract for the removal or demolition of the
building. If there are no such credits or if the sum total of such costs
exceeds the total of such credits, a detailed statement of the aforesaid
costs and amount so due shall be filed with the Municipal Tax Assessor
or other custodian of the records of tax liens, and a copy thereof shall
be forthwith forwarded to the owner by registered mail. If the total of
the credits exceed such costs, the balance remaining shall be deposited
in the Superior Court by the public officer, shall be secured in such
manner as may be directed by such Court and shall be disbursed
according to the order or judgment of the Court to the persons found to
be entitled thereto by final order or judgment of such Court; provided,
however that nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or
limit in any way the power of the municipality to define and declare
nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement, by summary
proceedings or otherwise. Any owner or party in interest may, within 60

Any violation of any ordinance other than this code discovered by a housing
inspector shall be reported to the Housing Officer, who shall refer the
alleged violation to the official or agency responsible for the enforcement of
such other ordinance.
§ 219-159. Action to evict occupants causing violation.
Where there exists a violation of occupancy standards hereunder, an owner
or operator, upon receipt of a notice of violation, if unable to eliminate the
violation by peaceable means within the period of time specified in said
notice shall commence within such period legal action to dispossess, evict
or eject the occupants who cause the violation. No further action hereunder
shall then be taken against the owner or operator so long as the action
aforesaid is pending in the court and is prosecuted expeditiously and in
good faith.
§ 219-160. Exception to written notice requirements. [Added
5-3-1984 by Ord. No. 787-84]
Notwithstanding any of the requirements pertaining to notice from the
Housing Officer, where a violation of the code or regulations hereunder is
found to exist, where the violation or condition existing on the premises
is of such a nature as to constitute an immediate threat to life or limb or
to constitute any emergent threat to public health, safety or welfare which
requires that it be abated without delay, no written notice shall be required
from the City of Passaic to be served on the person or persons responsible
for the violation or condition. In the event a violation or condition of the
character set forth in the preceding sentence arises, the Housing Officer
or his agent shall attempt to communicate verbally with the person or
days from the date of the filing of the lien certificate, proceed in a
summary manner in the Superior Court to contest the reasonableness
of the amount or the accuracy of the costs set forth in the municipal lien
certificate. [Added 6-1-1978 by Ord. No. 484-78]
C. Pursuant to Chapter 113 of the Laws of 1978 (N.J.S.A. 40:48-1.1),
whenever the City of Passaic, pursuant to law or pursuant to any
ordinance, code, rule or regulation adopted pursuant to law, undertakes
the removal or demolition of any building or structure which is
dangerous to human life or the public welfare or which constitutes a
fire hazard, the governing body of the municipality, in addition to
assessing the cost of such removal or demolition as a municipal lien
against the premises, may enforce the payment of such assessment,
together with interest, as a debt of the owner of the premises and may
authorize the institution of an action at law for the collection thereof.
The Superior Court, a County Court, or a County District Court shall
have jurisdiction of any such action. [Added 4-26-1979 by Ord. No.

persons responsible for the correction thereof in order to apprise such
person or persons of the nature of the condition or violation. In the event
the Housing Officer or his agent is unable to apprise the person or persons
responsible for the violation or condition of such violation of condition
after reasonable efforts, the Housing Officer or his agent may abate the
violation or condition immediately and may thereafter file a complaint in
Municipal Court charging such person or persons with such violation or
condition. It shall not be a defense in a Municipal Court prosecution, where
the violation or condition existing on the premises is of such a nature as to
constitute an immediate threat to life or limb or an emergent threat to the
health, safety or welfare of the public, that a written notice was not served
on the defendant. For the purposes of this chapter, the term "reasonable
efforts" shall mean the placement of one or more telephone calls and
the transmission of a telegraphic message setting forth the violation or
violations and the abatement action taken to the person or persons
responsible for the violation of the condition, whether or not the Housing
Officer or his agent actually verbally apprises the person or persons
responsible for the violation or condition with the nature of the violation.
§ 219-161. Failure to comply with order to repair. [Added 10-4-1984
by Ord. No. 808-84]
In the event that the owner of a building which is the subject of an order
pursuant to § 219-154 or § 219-155 fails to comply with said order for repair,
alteration or improvement after notice and reasonable opportunity to do so
and where such failure to comply results in the continuation of a condition
harmful to the health, welfare or safety of the occupants of the building or to
the general public, the Housing Officer may, by and with the approval of the
City Council, bring an action in the Superior Court to be appointed receiver
ex officio of the rents and income from the property and expend this money
for the purpose of making such repairs, alterations or improvements as
are necessary to correct the harmful conditions. The rents and income so
collected by the receiver shall also be available for the payment of such
costs and expenses of the receivership, as may be adjudged by the Court,
and for the payment to the City of any fines or penalties which may have
been imposed on the owner for violations of this code and which have not
been paid by the person therefor. The Court may proceed in the action in
a summary manner or otherwise. The receiver shall not be required to give
bond and shall be appointed only for the said purposes.
§ 219-162. Duties of receiver. [Added 10-4-1984 by Ord. No. 808-84]
A. Upon his appointment, the receiver, by and with the approval of the
governing body, in all cases where the real property in question is
encumbered by a first mortgage, shall appoint such first mortgage if
such mortgagee is a proper person and is willing to accept such
appointment as the receiver's agent to collect the rents and income
from such real property and manage the same; and in all other cases,
the receiver, by and with the approval of the governing body, may
designate the person in charge or management of such real property or

by Ord. No. 808-84]
Except as otherwise provided herein, the procedure in respect to any such
receivership shall be, as in the case of receiverships, to secure the payment
of delinquent taxes, penalties, costs, interest and expenses, wherein a
collector of taxes of a municipality is the receiver. In any receivership
proceeding under this section, the Court shall have jurisdiction to make
such orders and directions to the receiver as may be necessary to effectuate
the purpose of this section and to conserve the real property during the
pendency of the receivership.150
some other competent person as the receiver's agent to collect the
rents and income from such real property and manage the same, which
mortgagee or other person shall account promptly to the receiver
for the rents and income so collected; provided, however, that if the
mortgagee or other person so designated is derelict in collecting or
accounting for such rents and income or in the management of such
real property, the receiver shall apply to Court for the removal of such
designated mortgagee or other person, upon notice in writing to him,
and the Court upon removing such designated mortgagee or other
person, in its discretion, may designate another person to collect the
rents and income from such real property and manage the same and
account to the receiver for the rents and income of such real property
as aforesaid.
B. Upon completion of the repairs, alterations or improvements cited in
the order subject to which the receiver was appointed and upon
payment therefor, the agent shall be discharged from his or her
appointment and the payment of rent or other income from the subject
property shall revert to the owner. Any balance of funds in the control of
the agent, after payment of all costs and fees, shall be paid to the owner.
A. In any recievership, no fees shall be allowed the receiver or his counsel
for action as receiver or counsel.
B. The agent appointed to collect rents and income and to manage the
property and to see that the required repairs, alterations or
improvements are made may be paid a management fee as shall be
approved by the City Council at the time of appointment, and such fee
shall be paid from the proceeds of the rents and income.

§ 219-165. Additional penalty for second violation.151
Where an owner, operator or occupant has been convicted of a violation of
this code and within 12 months thereafter has been found by the Magistrate
of the Municipal Court to be guilty of a second violation, the Court may, if
it finds that the second offense was willful and inexcusable, sentence the
offender in addition to or in lieu of the fine set forth in Chapter 1, General
Provisions, Article II, General Penalty, to imprisonment in the County Jail for
a period not to exceed 90 days.
§ 219-166. Applicability to agents or officers.

Additional Rules and Regulations
§ 219-169. Promulgation of rules and regulations.
The Housing Officer is hereby authorized and empowered to promulgate
such written rules and regulations as may be necessary for the proper
interpretation and administration of the provisions of this code, provided
that such rules and regulations do not conflict with this code and conform
to the general standards prescribed by this code. The Housing Officer shall
file copies of such rules and regulations with the City Clerk and shall make
available in the Housing Officer's office a copy for inspection by the public.
§ 219-170. Power to vary or modify provisions.
The Housing Officer shall have the power to modify or vary provisions of
this code if:
§ 219-171. Hearing.
Upon denial of any such application, the owner, operator or applicant may
request a hearing which shall be held in accordance with provisions of
§ 219-154.
§ 219-172. Application not to constitute a defense.
Such application shall not constitute a defense of any violation of this code
concerning which any proceedings are pending in the Municipal Court
when the application is filed, nor shall any variance or modification allowed
hereunder constitute a vested right against any ordinance enacted
A. The strict enforcement of the provisions of this code would require the
installation of repairs and improvements estimated to exceed $300 in
cost, and the premises subject to this code are contemplated for
acquisition or are within an area where acquisition is contemplated by a
public agency having the power of eminent domain and there is a
reasonable likelihood that the said premises will be acquired within a
period of one year; provided, however, that any waiver of the provisions
of this code shall be canceled and the Housing Officer shall strictly
enforce the code if it shall be ascertained, subsequent to the granting of
the waiver, that the premises are in fact not to be acquired for any
public use or purpose.
B. Strict compliance with this code would require substantial structural
changes to the premises, and the nonconformity is of a technical and
insubstantial character or there is an alternative means satisfactory to
the Housing Officer to be used, which will eliminate violations of this
code constituting hazards to the health, safety and welfare of the
occupants of the premises and persons in the immediate vicinity
thereof.

by the Housing Officer or by action of any court, a written record thereof
stating the name of the applicant, the address of the premises, the variation
or modification approved, date of approval and the reasons therefor,
satisfying the provisions contained herein, shall be prepared by the Housing
Officer and filed both under the section or sections of this code to which the
variation or modification applies and under the address of the premises, and
such files shall be available for public inspection in the office of the Housing
Officer during the regular business hours.
§ 219-174. Annual review of provisions.
The Housing Officer shall, in the month of December of each year, review
with the City Counsel the procedures and operation of this code and report
to the Mayor and City Council on or before January 1:
A. Any recommended amendment, addition or modification of provisions
of this code consonant with the field experience of the personnel
charged with the enforcement.
B. A summary of the enforcement experience, indicating the number of
violations abated, the number of cases processed in the Municipal
Court, the number of inspections made and such other and further
pertinent information as will provide the Mayor and Council with an
annual account of progress in securing the standards required by this
code.
C. Any further recommendation as to how the code and procedure and
operations thereunder can be improved.

in excess of six in the subject property, cause an inspection to be made of
the premises and issue an informational report of the inspections to the
applicant, indicating therein any violations of this code on the premises.
The applicant for such inspection shall state, in writing, his full name,
residence and the reasons and basis for which the inspection is requested.
The Housing Officer may deny the application for failure to comply with this

violation then pending shall be sent to the applicant upon payment, in
advance, of a fee of $10, plus $0.50 per page of any document which
exceeds 10 standard pages of 8 1/2 inches by 11 inches.
§ 219-177. Inspection or status report not to constitute a defense.
No inspection report issued under § 219-175 or status report under
§ 219-176 shall be construed as providing a defense against any violation
of this code or any other ordinance of the City which may be discovered
thereafter, whether the condition or violation existed at the time of any such
inspection or status report. The inspection or status report is provided as
a convenience to the public and shall not constitute a limitation on the full
enforcement of this code. The inspection or status report shall include only
such matters as are embraced in this code.

affidavit setting forth the facts by the owner or operator, the Housing
Officer shall serve a five-day written notice of a hearing in accordance
§ 219-178 POLICE AND FIRE EQUIPMENT § 219-181
215:717
with the provisions for service contained in § 219-152 upon the tenant
affected by the application. At the hearing, the Housing Officer shall provide

§ 219-185. Basis for determination.
In making a determination of whether a building is unfit for human

of violations of this code existing in the building or on the premises, that
continued occupancy of the building will not endanger and jeopardize the
health and safety of the occupants or persons in the vicinity of the premises,
and to that end, he may consider, among other factors:
§ 219-186. Hearing; order. [Amended 4-23-1987 by Ord. No. 982-87]
After the holding of a hearing as prescribed in § 219-184, the Housing
Officer shall make a determination as to whether the building is unfit for
human habitation or use and thereupon he shall make an order, based upon
A. Whether the premises are so structurally defective that there is a risk of
collapse or of loose materials falling and injuring persons in and around
the building.
B. Whether by reason of electrical wiring, conduits or equipment, heating
or cooking facilities or lack of proper means of egress there is a danger
of fire or, in the case of fire, inadequate means of egress.
C. Whether premises are deficient in one or more essential utilities,
including public sewer, water supply or electricity.
D. Where premises were not designed or constructed for human
habitation, whether by reason of the same, occupancy constitutes an
unnecessary hazard to safety or health.
§ 219-184.1 PASSAIC CODE § 219-186
215:722
an evaluation of health and safety factors in the use of the premises, as
follows:
A. That occupancy of all or part of the building be permitted for a limited
period of time not to exceed 30 days, upon the stipulation that all
violations recited in the order are corrected or abated within the time
and, if not corrected or abated, the premises be vacated within 10 days
thereafter.
B. That the building or any part thereof be ordered vacated within a
specified period not to exceed 30 days, be boarded up and signs or
notices that occupancy is prohibited be posted prominently at all the
entrances of the building and that the order continue in effect until the
conditions are abated and the order revoked as provided herein. The
order may prohibit occupants from paying, and the owner and operator
from receiving, rent or other compensation for use and occupancy while
it remains in effect; or
C. That by reason of the complete state of disrepair and the
disproportionate investment required to restore the building to
habitable condition and the danger that the premises constitute, even
while vacant, a threat to the health or safety of persons on or near the
premises, that the improvement of the building is impracticable and
continuance of the building vacant constitutes a danger to the health,
safety and well-being of the neighborhood, whereupon the building is to
be ordered vacated and demolished within a period of time not to
exceed 60 days, unless the owner, after having the premises vacated,
consents, where no emergency exists, in writing to rehabilitate the
building so that it complies in all respects with this code within six
months and provides, if required by the Housing Officer, a performance
bond guaranteeing that the work be done; or unless the owner, if the
Housing Officer deems it feasible without jeopardizing public health
and safety, agrees with the Housing Officer to put the premises up for
sale on terms, conditions and limitations which would provide a
reasonable expectancy of securing the rehabilitation of the building
thereon within a reasonable period of time, and further that if such sale
does not occur within the time specified, the Housing Officer may
thereafter demolish the building without further notice or proceedings.
D. Any tenant who received a notice of eviction pursuant to N.J.S.A.
2A:18-61.2(c) that results from zoning or code enforcement activity for
an illegal occupancy, as set forth in N.J.S.A. 2A:18-61.1g(c), shall be
considered a displaced person and shall be entitled to relocation
assistance in an amount equal to six times the monthly rental paid by
the displaced person. The owner of the structure shall be liable for the
payment of relocation assistance pursuant to this section. In addition to
being required to pay reimbursement for relocation assistance, an
additional fine shall be paid by the owner of the structure for each
illegal occupancy, up to an amount equal to six times the monthly rental
paid by the displaced person. [Added 12-1-1994 by Ord. No.

locked and first-story or basement and cellar windows barred or boarded
to prevent entry. Where an order is issued under § 219-186, it shall be
served on all persons affected thereby pursuant to § 219-151. When the
conditions of the violations complained of are corrected, the owner or
occupant affected thereby may request a reinspection, which shall be
provided upon the payment of a reinspection fee of $10. Based on the
reinspection, the Housing Officer shall issue a further order which shall
either revoke the previous order and permit occupancy or state such further
conditions or time limits during which additional repairs or improvements
are to be made before occupancy is again permitted or order vacation and
demolition as in § 219-186. Upon compliance with the conditions contained
in any order, the Housing Officer shall permit the signs to be removed and
the premises made available again for occupancy.
§ 219-188. Failure to comply. [Amended 9-24-1992 by Ord. No.
1186-92]
Where the owner, operator or occupancy fails to comply with any order
hereunder or to perform in accordance with any written commitment as
provided herein or removes any notice posted pursuant thereto or any
lock or bar without the permission of the Housing Officer, he shall be
deemed in violation of this code and subject to the penalties provided
herein. In addition thereto, the Housing Officer may take such steps as may
be necessary to compel vacation and boarding up of any premises and may
post signs prohibiting occupancy. Additionally, the Housing Officer may take
whatever actions necessary to repair or demolish the building or buildings,
or part thereof, and to assess the costs of such repair or demolition as a
municipal lien against the premises.
§ 219-189. Vacation of premises in emergency.
Where the Housing Officer makes a preliminary finding that conditions on
the premises constitute an immediate and substantial threat to the safety
and health of occupants or persons in proximity to the premises, he may
order and direct that the premises be vacated immediately and that signs
or notice be posted prohibiting occupancy thereof and that the premises
be locked and boarded up as provided in § 219-187. Any party aggrieved
thereby may, within 10 days thereafter, make a request for a hearing in
accordance with §§ 219-153 and 219-154, and upon holding a hearing as
provided herein and the making of a determination that the premises are
fit for human occupancy or that the premises upon the removal of certain
specified conditions will become again fit for human occupancy, the order
may be rescinded or modified and the signs, bars and locks as provided
herein removed when the premises are again fit for human habitation and
the specified conditions, if any, are satisfied.

§ 231-6. Application for hardship rental increase.
A property owner whose current rentals are insufficient to provide a fair
return may apply to the Rent Leveling Board for a hardship increase permit
a fair, just and reasonable rate of return. Prior to any such appeal to the
Board, a landlord must post in the lobby in each building or, if no lobby is
present, in a conspicuous place in and about the premises a notice of said
appeal, setting forth the basis for said appeal. Said notice must be posted
and served upon the tenants at least 10 days prior to the proposed date of
said appeal.
A. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
FAIR NET OPERATING INCOME — Gross maximized annual income
less reasonable and necessary operating expenses, such expenses not
to exceed 65% of the gross maximized annual income.
GROSS MAXIMIZED ANNUAL INCOME — All income resulting directly
or indirectly from the operation of such multiple dwelling or dwellings,
including but not limited to all rent received or collectible, including
any rent from a less-than-arm's-length transaction, the landlord share
of interest on security deposits, all earnings from commissions, vending
machines, deductions from security deposits, late fees, pet fees,
parking fees, pool fees, key charges, finder's fees, amounts received
from successful tax appeals, income from rebates, tax surcharges,
capital improvement surcharges, rent surcharges and hardship
surcharges.
REASONABLE AND NECESSARY OPERATING EXPENSES — All valid
expenses incurred and paid by the landlord in the operation of such
multiple dwelling or dwellings during the period reflected in income
computed or in accordance with the provisions and limitations of this
section.
B. Application for increase.
(1) Whenever a landlord shall determine that the reasonable and
necessary operating expenses, as hereinabove defined and
hereinbelow set forth, of a multiple dwelling or dwellings subject to
rent regulation under the terms of this chapter are greater than
65% of the gross maximized annual income, as hereinbefore
defined, of such multiple dwelling or dwellings, said landlord may
make application to the Rent Leveling Board for a hardship rental
increase.
(2) When a landlord shall file an application before the Rent Leveling
Board for a hardship rental increase, the Rent Leveling Board shall
review said application to determine the eligibility of the landlord
for said hardship increase pursuant to this chapter, to determine
that the facts set forth in said application comply with the
determination of the net operating expenses as set forth
§ 231-6 REAL ESTATE PRACTITIONERS § 231-6
229:749
hereinbelow and to modify said facts to conform to those articles of
net operating expenses as discussed hereinbelow.
(3) If the Rent Leveling Board is satisfied that the landlord named in
said application is eligible for a hardship rental increase and that
the facts set forth in said application comply as required in
Subsection B(2) hereinabove, then said Rent Leveling Board shall
compute the proper gross maximized annual income by dividing the
reasonable and necessary operating expenses contained in the
application, as they may be modified by the Board, by 65%, said
reasonable and necessary operating expenses being the numerator
of the equation and 65% being the denominator. The Rent Leveling
Board shall subtract from the new gross maximized annual income
that gross maximized annual income which was previously received
by the landlord/applicant and which was set forth in his application
to the Board. The resulting remainder shall be prorated to all other
dwelling units within the multiple dwelling or dwellings covered by
the application in the ratio that the total square feet of dwelling
area contained in each such dwelling unit bears to the total square
feet of the dwelling area contained in the multiple dwelling or
dwellings covered by the application. The Rent Leveling Board
shall have the discretion to divide the prorated rental increases per
apartment over a period not to exceed six months so as to minimize
the effect of said rental increase on the tenants of said dwelling
units.
(4) The application of the landlord for a hardship rental increase shall
include all facts and figures of at least three years of income and
expenses, if available, all of which shall be duly certified under or
by the landlord or his agent and shall be supported by a statement
from a certified public accountant as to the accuracy of said facts
and figures. At the time of application, the landlord shall notify all
tenants affected, in writing, that an application is being made and
is available to any tenants requesting the same. The owner shall
also make available to the tenants and the Rent Leveling Board all
records and books supporting the application. Any interested
tenants or groups of tenants or association of tenants who wish to
be heard at the public meeting may notify the Rent Leveling Board
of their intention, and the Rent Leveling Board shall permit that
tenant, group of tenants or association of tenants to be parties to
the hearing. This provision shall be liberally construed as to afford
ample opportunity for all interested parties to present their views
before the Rent Leveling Board.
C. In computing gross maximized annual income under this section, the
following limitations shall apply in all cases:
(1) No allowance shall be permitted for a vacancy, except as the same
may be adequately demonstrated to be the result of market
conditions and/or deteriorated physical conditions of the dwelling
§ 231-6 PASSAIC CODE § 231-6
229:750
unit which the landlord/applicant may show as to be unavailable for
rental due to said deteriorated conditions.
(2) Income and expenses arising out of a nonresidential use, including
that for professional or commercial space resulting from arm'slength
transactions.
(3) No loss caused by a nonresidential use may be considered.
D. In computing reasonable and necessary operating expenses under this
section, the following limitations shall apply in all cases:
(1) Taxes shall be limited to amounts actually paid, including those in
escrow for appeal, and the landlord shall further demonstrate that
taxes assessed against the property were reasonable and, if not,
have been appealed.
(2) Repairs and maintenance shall be limited to arm's-length
transactions and shall be reasonable and necessary as not to cause
over maintenance of premises. The cost of service contracts shall
be prorated over the period covered. Painting costs shall be
prorated over the number of years of the actual painting cycle in
the building, but in no event shall painting be prorated over a
period of less than three years for the interior of dwelling units or
five years for the exterior and common areas.
(3) The purchase of new equipment shall be reflected and prorated
over the useful life of the term.
(4) Legal and auditing expenses shall be limited to reasonable and
necessary costs of the operation of the property. No legal expenses
or audit expenses shall be allowed as a deduction that do not
directly result from the landlord/tenant relationship. A landlord
may not deduct expenses incurred in litigating any declaratory or
injunctive relief as to his rights under any state, local or federal
law, except for actions in the nature of a writ of mandamus. All
costs shall be itemized on the application.
(5) Management fees shall be limited to actual services performed,
including the resident manager's salary, telephone expenses,
postage, office supplies, stationery and the value of the apartment
provided if included in income. In no event shall management fees
expend 5% of the first $50,000 of gross maximized income,
including commercial and professional space income, 4 1/2% of the
next $25,000, 4% of the next $100,000, 3 1/2% of the next
$100,000 and 3% of any amount over $275,000.
(6) Salaries not included in management fees shall be limited to actual
services performed, and amounts for similar positions in the area,
including rental value, if included in income, and expenses and
wages and benefits paid.

and shall be prorated over the terms of the policies and shall not
include the landlord's life, medical or other personal policies.

or mortgage service fees for any reasons shall be allowed.
(11) The history of the income and expenses shall be consistent with the
application or fully documented as to any changes.

chapter shall distribute a copy of this chapter to each tenant within 30
days after the effective date of this chapter and, in the event of new
tenancies, shall, within 30 days of the establishment of a landlord/
tenant relationship, distribute a copy of this chapter to each new tenant
and maintain a ledger of said distribution.

he shall be subject to the penalty provisions in § 231-14 of this chapter
and shall not be permitted to pass on any increases as permitted under
§§ 231-4, 231-5 and 231-6. The landlord shall file proof of service of
each distribution of this chapter with the Rent Leveling Board within 30
days after such distribution, which proof shall be in the form of an
affidavit or certification.
A. There is hereby created a Rent Leveling Board within the City of
Passaic. Said Board shall consist of three regular members. The regular
members shall be a landlord, a tenant and an expert member of the
general public. All members must be residents of Passaic. The terms of
regular members shall be four years. Each member shall serve without
compensation.
B. There shall be three alternate members, including one tenant, one
landlord and one expert member of the general public, all of whom
must be residents of the City of Passaic. The terms of said alternate
members of the Board shall be for a period of four years. In the event
that a permanent member is absent or unavailable for a meeting, then
the member appointed in the same category, i.e., tenant and alternate
§ 231-6 PASSAIC CODE § 231-8
229:752
tenant, landlord and alternate landlord or expert and alternate expert,
shall replace the permanent member. In no case shall an alternate
member replace the member of a different category at any meeting.
Each alternate member shall serve without compensation.
C. The Council, by majority vote, shall select all regular and alternate
Board members, and members shall serve until their successor is
qualified and appointed. If there are any vacancies on the Board, the
Council shall fill the seat for the remainder of the term. Any Board
member who shall, during a calendar year, be absent for three
consecutive regularly scheduled meetings of the Board to which he or
she has been appointed shall be subject to removal by the City Council
in accordance with the provisions of this section. The Secretary to the
Rent Leveling Board shall be required to report to the City Council
three consecutive absences in the calendar year by any member of the
Board, and when requested to do by the Council, the member of the
Board who missed three consecutive regularly scheduled meetings
during the calendar year shall submit a written explanation for each of
his or her absences. [Amended 2-8-2011 by Ord. No. 1861-11]
D. In the event that the Council determines preliminarily that there have
been three consecutive absences from regularly scheduled meetings by
any appointed member and that the absences are without "reasonable
justification" as defined herein, the Council shall have the right to adopt
a resolution to institute removal proceedings. No member of the Board
shall be removed based on his or her absence at a regularly scheduled
meeting where there was a reasonable justification for the absence.
"Reasonable justification" for absence shall mean illness of the Board
member or immediate family member of the Board member; exigent
business or personal responsibilities which render it impracticable for
the Board member to be in attendance. Where the Council has
instituted such removal proceedings, the proceedings shall be as
follows: [Amended 2-8-2011 by Ord. No. 1861-11]
(1) A written notice of intention to remove shall be mailed to the Board
member at his or her home address. The notice shall advise the
Board member as to a right to a hearing before the City Council; as
to the right to be represented by counsel; and as to the right to
cross-examine witnesses and present witnesses on his or her
behalf. The notice shall set forth a date for a proposed hearing and
shall notify the Board member that if he or she wishes to contest
the removal, a written notice of intention to contest must be
submitted to the City Clerk at least 10 days prior to the scheduled
hearing. The notice to the Board member shall list the dates of the
regularly scheduled meetings from which the Board member is
alleged to have been absent.
(2) The hearing shall be conducted by the City Council in Council
chambers. The Board member shall have a right to participate in
the proceedings, either personally or by counsel, and shall have a
right to examine witnesses and present evidence. Upon conclusion

opportunity to be heard before making any determination. The
application shall give 10 days' written notice to the other party.
F. The Rent Leveling Board shall, within 30 days after holding any hearing

determination.
§ 231-11. Standards of service and maintenance to be maintained;
log book; reduction in standards.
During the term of this chapter, every landlord shall maintain the same
standards of service and maintenance and shall provide the same furniture,
furnishings and equipment in the multiple-dwelling housing space covered
hereby as was maintained and provided on the date of the initial rental
between the landlord and said tenant, except where the tenant has
previously received a reduction in rent by virtue of a reduction in services
application before the Rent Leveling Board, based upon a difference or
differences in service and maintenance between the date of the initial rental
between said landlord and tenant and the effective date of this chapter.
A. Landlords shall be required to keep a rental log book of each apartment
in his or its building. The rent log shall include the apartment number,
name of tenant, rental paid and number of rooms. This log must be
produced for all apartments upon request of the Rent Leveling Board. A
landlord in violation of this section shall be subject to the punishment
prescribed in § 231-14 hereof.
B. A property owner or tenant may seek a reduction in the standards of
service and/or maintenance rendered to the tenants, provided that the
tenants receive a proportionate decrease in rental for the loss of
services and/or maintenance. The property owner shall notify each
tenant at least 10 days prior to the hearing of the total cost of the
services and/or maintenance to be reduced, the average annual cost of
the service to be reduced, the total number of rooms of housing space in
the structure in which any multiple-dwelling space is situated, the total
number of rooms occupied by the tenant and the amount of the
reduction in rental which is proposed for each tenant. The tenant shall
receive a reduction in rent in the same proportion to the total annual
reduction in rent as the number of rooms occupied by said tenant bears
to the total number of rooms of housing space in the building or
structure in question. Any property owner seeking a reduction in the
standards of service and/or maintenance shall apply for such reduction
to the Rent Leveling Board. If any reduction in rent shall be granted,
such reduction shall decrease the base rent for each such unit of
housing space. In no event shall the Rent Leveling Board grant any
reduction in service and/or regard to building or health codes, or which
would violate any laws of the State of New Jersey. Commencing with the
first of the month next succeeding the completion of the reduction in
services and/or maintenance, each tenant affected thereby shall receive
the proportionate reduction in the base rent as provided by the decision
of the Rent Leveling Board.

No. 1480-99154 ]
Any tenants desiring to remain in their units may do so without provocation
or retaliation from landlords. For the purposes of this section, harassment
of tenants shall mean conduct, whether direct or indirect, committed
intentionally or negligently by a landlord or anyone acting on his behalf.
These actions include, but are not limited to: a reduction in the quality of
basic services necessary to the health, safety and welfare of the tenants;
heat, hot water; adequate security; intermittent failures; bothersome
telephone calls or letters; frivolous eviction threats or legal proceedings;
and actions which would cause a reasonable person of like age and physical
condition of a tenant to fear for his/her life, limb, property or home.
§ 231-14. Violations and penalties.
Any person found guilty of violating any provisions of this chapter or of
willfully filing with the Rent Leveling Board any material misstatement of
fact shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or by imprisonment
for a term not exceeding 90 days, or both. A violation affecting two or
more tenancies shall be considered a separate violation as to each tenancy.
However, notwithstanding this section, any landlord who fails to refund the
percentage of his property tax reduction as required by § 231-17 hereof
shall pay a fine of $100 per day for every day that the reduction to the
tenants is later than the deadline set forth in § 231-17, in addition to the
penalty prescribed in this section.
§ 231-15. Provisions to be liberally construed.
This chapter, being necessary for the welfare of the City and its inhabitants
shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purpose hereof.

surcharge; application by tenant for relief. [Amended 9-23-2008 by
Ord. No. 1775-08]

or for a reduction of services shall be accompanied by a fee of $50 per
apartment unit but not more than $1,000 per building. Any tenant may
apply to the Rent Leveling Board for relief under any of the provisions of
this chapter. No application by a tenant shall be required to be accompanied

Administrator shall, upon the submission of every application for rental
increase, inspect the Code Enforcement, Health Department and Division
of Housing files in order to determine if any violation or violations exist
pertaining to the application being submitted. If any such violation or
violations are present, any hardship rental increase granted to a particular
landlord cannot be implemented until all violations which, in the

electrical, plumbing or structural violations, or which, in total, are
substantial quantitatively are corrected.
§ 231-19. Complaints.
Any complaints pertaining to the provisions of this chapter by landlords
or tenants may be brought to the attention of the Rent Leveling Board
Administrator, City Hall, at 365-5542 between the hours of 8:30 a.m. to 4:00

any weekday (Monday through Friday) where at least 48 hours' notice, in
writing, has been given in order for the landlord to make necessary repairs
may be considered as an element of a violation of N.J.S.A. 2A:18-61.1(c) for
which that tenant can be evicted in accordance with N.J.S.A. 2A:18-61 et
seq.
A. Any property owner under this chapter who receives a municipal

the site or from being exposed to stormwater. Source control plans
should be developed based upon physical site conditions and the origin,
nature and the anticipated quantity or amount of potential pollutants.
Multiple stormwater management BMPs may be necessary to achieve
the established performance standards for water quality, quantity and
groundwater recharge.

Stormwater management requirements for major development are as
follows:
A. Stormwater management measures for major development shall be
developed to meet the erosion control, groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity and stormwater runoff quality standards in
§ 258A-4. To the maximum extent practicable, these standards shall be
met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater management strategies
into the design. If these strategies alone are not sufficient to meet these
standards, structural stormwater management measures necessary to
meet these standards shall be incorporated into the design.
B. The standards in this chapter apply only to new major development and
are intended to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on water
quality and water quantity in receiving water bodies and maintain
groundwater recharge. The standards do not apply to new major
development to the extent that alternative design and performance
standards are applicable under a regional stormwater management
plan or water quality management plan adopted in accordance with
Department rules.
A. The development shall incorporate a maintenance plan for the
stormwater management measures incorporated into the design of a
major development in accordance with § 258A-10.
B. Stormwater management measures shall avoid adverse impacts of
concentrated flow on habitat for threatened and endangered species as
documented in the Department Landscape Project or Natural Heritage
Database established under N.J.S.A. 13:1B-15.147 through 15.150,
particularly Helonias bullata (swamp pink) and/or Clemmys
muhlenbergi (bog turtle).
C. The following linear development projects are exempt from the
groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity and stormwater
runoff quality requirements of Subsection F and G:
(1) The construction of an underground utility line, provided that the
disturbed areas are revegetated upon completion;
§ 258A-2 STORAGE TANKS, UNDERGROUND § 258A-4
257:801
(2) The construction of an aboveground utility line, provided that the
existing conditions are maintained to the maximum extent
practicable; and
(3) The construction of a public pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk
or trail with a maximum width of 14 feet, provided that the access
is made of permeable material.
D. A waiver from strict compliance from the groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity and stormwater runoff quality requirements
of Subsection F and G may be obtained for the enlargement of an
existing public roadway or railroad; or the construction or enlargement
of a public pedestrian access, provided that the following conditions are
met:
(1) The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the
project that cannot be accomplished by any other means;
(2) The applicant demonstrates, through an alternative analysis, that
through the use of nonstructural and structural stormwater
management strategies and measures, the option selected
complies with the requirements of Subsections F and G to the
maximum extent practicable;
(3) The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the requirements
of Subsections F and G, existing structures currently in use, such
as homes and buildings, would need to be condemned; and
(4) The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other
rights to areas, including the potential to obtain through
condemnation lands not falling under Subsection D(3) above within
the upstream drainage area of the receiving stream, that would
provide additional opportunities to mitigate the requirements of
Subsections F and G that were not achievable on site.
E. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in Subsections F
and G shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies set forth in this subsection into the design.
The applicant shall identify the nonstructural strategies
incorporated into the design of the project. If the applicant
contends that it is not feasible for engineering, environmental or
safety reasons to incorporate any nonstructural stormwater
management strategies identified in Subsection E(2) below into the
design of a particular project, the applicant shall identify the
strategy considered and provide a basis for the contention.
(2) Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated

(a) Protect areas that provide water quality benefits or areas
particularly susceptible to erosion and sediment loss;
(b) Minimize impervious surfaces and break up or disconnect the
flow of runoff over impervious surfaces;
(c) Maximize the protection of natural drainage features and
vegetation;
(d) Minimize the decrease in the time of concentration from

discharging into and through stable vegetated areas;
(i) Provide other source controls to prevent or minimize the use or
exposure of pollutants at the site in order to prevent or
minimize the release of those pollutants into stormwater
runoff. Such source controls include, but are not limited to:
[1] Site design features that help to prevent accumulation of
trash and debris in drainage systems, including features
that satisfy Subsection E(3) below;
[2] Site design features that help to prevent discharge of trash
and debris from drainage systems;
[3] Site design features that help to prevent and/or contain
spills or other harmful accumulations of pollutants at
industrial or commercial developments; and

§ 258A-4 STORAGE TANKS, UNDERGROUND § 258A-4
257:803
[1] Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a
storm drain or surface water body under that grate:
[a] The New Jersey Department of Transportation
(NJDOT) bicycle safe grate, which is described in
Chapter 2.4 of the NJDOT Bicycle Compatible
Roadways and Bikeways Planning and Design
Guidelines (April 1996); or

bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground surfaces
include surfaces of roads (including bridges), driveways,
parking areas, bikeways, plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields,
open channels and stormwater basin floors.
[3] Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the
clear space in that curb opening (or each individual clear
space, if the curb opening has two or more clear spaces)
shall have an area of no more than seven square inches or
be no greater than two inches across the smallest
dimension.
[4] This standard does not apply:
[a] Where the review agency determines that this
standard would cause inadequate hydraulic
performance that could not practicably be overcome
by using additional or larger storm drain inlets that
meet these standards;
[b] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in Subsection G(1) are conveyed through any
device (e.g., end-of-pipe netting facility, manufactured
treatment device or a catch basin hood) that is
designed, at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all
solid and floatable materials that could not pass
through one of the following:
[i] A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2
inches wide (this option does not apply for outfall
netting facilities); or

available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 258A-7 or found on the Department's
website at www.njstormwater.org.
F. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
§ 258A-4 STORAGE TANKS, UNDERGROUND § 258A-4
257:805
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at § 258A-5, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain 100% of the average annual
preconstruction groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from preconstruction to postconstruction for the twoyear
storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the urban redevelopment area or to
projects subject to Subsection F(1)(b)[3] below.
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored or
applied; areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater-than-reportable
quantities, as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with Department-approved remedial action work plan
or landfill closure plan and areas with high risks for
spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
Source materials include, but are not limited to, raw
materials; intermediate products; final products;
waste materials; by-products; industrial machinery
and fuels, and lubricants, solvents and detergents that
are related to process, manufacturing or other
industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater.
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surficial ponding, flooding of basements or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
§ 258A-4 PASSAIC CODE § 258A-4
257:806
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
downgradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 258A-5, complete one of
the following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, postconstruction
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten- and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the
preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten- and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
and projected land uses, assuming full development under
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage
area;
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
postconstruction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten- and
one-hundred-year storm events are 50%, 75% and 80%
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the postconstruction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
site on which the proposed development or project is to be
constructed.
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of major development at § 258A-2 shall be submitted to
the appropriate soil conservation district for review and approval in
accordance with the requirements of this section and any
applicable soil conservation district guidelines for stormwater
runoff quantity and erosion control.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
postconstruction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater
runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the developed site,
expressed as an annual average. Stormwater management
measures shall only be required for water quality control if an
additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being proposed on a
development site. The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to
§ 258A-4 STORAGE TANKS, UNDERGROUND § 258A-4
257:807
any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric
effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or
in a discharge specifically exempt from this requirement under
a NJPDES permit. The water quality design storm is 1.25 inches
of rainfall in two hours. Water quality calculations shall take into
account the distribution of rain from the water quality design
storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation of the volume of
runoff may take into account the implementation of nonstructural
and structural stormwater management measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 258A-7 or found on the Department's
website at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other
sources of technical guidance are listed in § 258-7. TSS reduction
shall be calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in
Table 2 below. Alternative removal rates and methods of calculating
removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides
documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative
rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any approved
alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be
provided to the Department at the following address: Division of
Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, P.O. Box 418, Trenton, New Jersey 08625-0418.
(3) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
eighty-percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize
the following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A + B - (AXB)/100
Where
R = total TSS percent load removal from
application of both BMPs
A = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to
the first BMP
B = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to
the second BMP

(4) If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the eighty-percent
TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the
runoff from the subareas converge on site, in which case the
removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a
weighted average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the postconstruction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in Subsections F and G.
(6) Additional information and examples of stormwater quality BMPs
are contained in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual, which may be obtained from the address
identified in § 258A-7.
(7) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
(8) Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B and perennial
or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category
One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the
County Soil Surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area.
These areas shall be established for the protection of water quality,
aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional
recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance
and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category
One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A three-hundred-foot special water resource protection
area shall be provided on each side of the waterway,
§ 258A-4 PASSAIC CODE § 258A-4
257:810
measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of
the bank outwards or from the center line of the waterway
where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing
vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural
succession.
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under Subsection G(8)(a)[1]
above shall only be allowed where previous development
or disturbance has occurred (for example, active
agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn area).
The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable. In no case shall the remaining special water
resource protection area be reduced to less than 150 feet
as measured perpendicular to the top of bank of the
waterway or center line of the waterway where the bank is
undefined. All encroachments proposed under this
subsection shall be subject to review and approval by the
Department.
(b) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the standard for off-site stability in the Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under
the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et
seq.
(c) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
standard for off-site stability in the Standards for Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control in New Jersey, established under the Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq.,
then the stabilization measures in accordance with the
requirements of the above standards may be placed within the
special water resource protection area, provided that:
[1] Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150 feet
of the Category One waterway;
[2] Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
section shall achieve a ninety-five-percent TSS
postconstruction removal rate;
[3] Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
[4] The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
§ 258A-4 STORAGE TANKS, UNDERGROUND § 258A-4
257:811
§ 258A-5. Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater
recharge.
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable;
[5] A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate Department staff and soil conservation district
staff to identify necessary stabilization measures; and
[6] All encroachments proposed under this section shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(d) A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan or by a
municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to Subsection G(8) has been approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection, then the provisions
of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource
protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream
corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to Subsection
G(8) shall maintain or enhance the current functional value
and overall condition of the special water resource protection
area as defined in Subsection G(8)(a)[1] above. In no case shall
a stream corridor protection plan allow the reduction of the
Special Water Resource Protection Area to less than 150 feet
as measured perpendicular to the waterway subject to this
subsection.
(e) Subsection G(8) does not apply to the construction of one
individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Section 4 – Hydrology and
Technical Release 55 – Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds
or superseding document; or
(b) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
§ 258A-4 PASSAIC CODE § 258A-5
257:812
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition
of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at § 258A-5A(1)(a) and the Rational and
Modified Rational Methods at § 258A-5A(1)(b). A runoff coefficient
or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing condition may
be used on all or a portion of the site if the design engineer verifies
that the hydrologic condition has existed on the site or portion of
the site for at least five years without interruption prior to the time
of application. If more than one land cover has existed on the site
during the five years immediately prior to the time of application,
the land cover with the lowest runoff potential shall be used for the
computations. In addition, there is the presumption that the site is
in good hydrologic condition (if the land use type is pasture, lawn
or park), with good cover (if the land use type is woods) or with
good hydrologic condition and conservation treatment (if the land
use type is cultivation).
(3) In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows or
culverts, that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55 – Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds and other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater
management measures.
B. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
following:
(1) The New Jersey Geological Survey Report, GSR-32, A Method for
Evaluating Groundwater Recharge Areas in New Jersey,
incorporated herein by reference, as amended and supplemented.
Information regarding the methodology is available from the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual at
http://www.state.nj.us/dep/njgs/; or at New Jersey Geological
Survey, 29 Arctic Parkway, P.O. Box 427, Trenton, New Jersey
08625-0427; (609) 984-6587.
§ 258A-5 STORAGE TANKS, UNDERGROUND § 258A-6
257:813
§ 258A-6. Standards for structural and nonstructural stormwater
management measures.
A. Structural stormwater management measures.
(1) Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as
follows:
(a) Structural stormwater management measures shall be
designed to take into account the existing site conditions,
including, for example, environmentally critical areas,
wetlands; flood-prone areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high
water table; soil type, permeability and texture; drainage area
and drainage patterns; and the presence of solution-prone
carbonate rocks (limestone).
(b) Structural stormwater management measures shall be
designed to minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and
repairs and ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be
installed at the intake to the outlet structure, as appropriate,
and shall have parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the
bars to the elevation of the water quality design storm. For
elevations higher than the water quality design storm, the
parallel bars at the outlet structure shall be spaced no greater
than 1/3 the width of the diameter of the orifice or 1/3 the
width of the weir, with a minimum spacing between bars of one
inch and a maximum spacing between bars of six inches. In
addition, the design of trash racks must comply with the
requirements of § 258A-8D.
(c) Structural stormwater management measures shall be
designed, constructed and installed to be strong, durable and
corrosion resistant. Measures that are consistent with the
relevant portions of the Residential Site Improvement
Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3, 7.4 and 7.5 shall be deemed to
meet this requirement.
(d) Where tailwater will affect the hydraulic performance of a
stormwater management measure, the design engineer shall
include such effects in the measure's design.
(e) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management
basin, the orifice size shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 inches in
diameter.
(f) Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins
at § 258A-8.
(2) Stormwater management measure guidelines are available in the
New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. Other
stormwater management measures may be utilized, provided the
§ 258A-6 PASSAIC CODE § 258A-6
257:814
design engineer demonstrates that the proposed measure and its
design will accomplish the required water quantity, groundwater
recharge and water quality design and performance standards
established by Section 4 of this chapter.
(3) Manufactured treatment devices may be used to meet the
requirements of Section 4 of this chapter, provided the pollutant
removal rates are verified by the New Jersey Corporation for
Advanced Technology and certified by the Department.
B. Nonstructural stormwater strategies:
(1) Buffers. Buffer areas (Refer to §§ 317-23, 317-28, 317-43, 317-51
and 317-53 of the City's Code.) are required along all lot and street
lines separating residential uses from arterial and collector streets,
separating a nonresidential use from either a residential use or
residential zoning district line and along all street lines where
loading and storage areas can be seen from the street. The buffer
area shall use native vegetation, which requires less fertilization
and watering than nonnative species. Buffer areas may be used for
stormwater management by disconnecting impervious surfaces
and treating runoff from these impervious surfaces. Preservation of
natural wood tracts and limiting land disturbance for new
construction shall be incorporated where practical.
(2) Curbs and gutters. Curb cuts or flush curbs with curb stops are
encouraged where practical to allow vegetated swales to be used
for stormwater conveyance and to allow for the disconnection of
impervious areas where practical.
(3) Drainage systems. An existing ordinance (Refer to §§ 263-4,
263-11, 263-14, 263-15, 317-9, 317-18, 317-31, 317-50 and
317-51.) may require that all streets be provided with inlets and
pipes where the same are necessary for proper drainage. The use
of natural vegetated swales in lieu of inlets and pipes is encouraged
where practical.
(4) Driveways and accessways. The use of pervious paving materials to
minimize stormwater runoff and promote groundwater recharge
should be considered for driveways and accessways where
practical. Consideration should be given for subsurface soil
conditions. The use of crowned driveways is also encouraged to
promote disconnectivity between impervious surfaces and allow
grass areas to promote groundwater recharge.
(5) Natural features. Natural features, such as trees, brooks, swamps,
hilltops and views, are to be preserved whenever possible, and that
care be taken to preserve selected trees to enhance soil stability
and landscape treatment of the area. In addition, forested areas
shall be maintained to ensure that leaf litter and other beneficial
aspects of the forest are maintained in addition to the trees.
§ 258A-6 STORAGE TANKS, UNDERGROUND § 258A-6
257:815
(6) Nonconforming uses, structures or lots. The existing ordinance
(Refer to §§ 317-10, 317-4 and 317-56 through 317-59) may allow
an applicant/owner of an existing use to propose additions or
alterations that exceed the permitted building and/or lot coverage
percentages. The applicant should mitigate the impact of the
additional impervious surfaces unless the stormwater management
plan for the development provided for these increases in
impervious surfaces. This mitigation effort must address water
quality, flooding and groundwater recharge.
(7) Off-site and off-tract improvements. Any off-site and off-tract
stormwater management and drainage improvements shall
conform to the design and performance standards described herein
and in the City Code.
(8) Off-street parking and loading. Where practical, parking lots with
more than 10 spaces and all loading areas should allow for flush
curb with curb stop or curbing with curb cuts to encourage
developers to allow for the discharge of impervious areas into
landscaped areas for stormwater management. The use of natural
vegetated swales for the water quality design storm with overflow
for larger storm events into storm sewers should be utilized where
practical. A developer may demonstrate that fewer spaces would be
required, provided that area is set aside for additional spaces if
necessary. Pervious paving could be provided for overflow parking
areas.
(9) Performance standards. Pollution source control must be evaluated
in order to prohibit materials or wastes from being deposited upon
a lot in such form or manner that they can be transferred off the lot,
directly or indirectly, by natural forces such as precipitation,
evaporation or wind. Materials and wastes that might create a
pollutant or a hazard shall be enclosed with appropriate measures/
devices.
(10) Shade trees. The existing ordinance (Refer to §§ 263-9, 263-16,

along the street on which the building fronts. In addition to this
section, the City may adopt a tree preservation ordinance that
restricts and otherwise controls the removal of mature trees
throughout the City. This ordinance should recognize that the
preservation of mature trees and forested areas must be
considered in the management of environmental resources,
particularly watershed management, air quality, and ambient
heating and cooling. A critical disturbance area that extends
beyond the driveway and building footprint where clearing of trees
cannot occur shall be depicted on the plan minimizing land
disturbance. Identification of forested areas and the percentage of
wooded areas be protected from disturbance shall also be
provided.

A. This section sets forth requirements to protect public safety through
the proper design and operation of stormwater management basins.
This section applies to any new stormwater management basin. The
provisions of this section do not preempt more stringent municipal or
county safety requirements for new or existing stormwater
management basins. Municipal and county stormwater management
plans and ordinances may, pursuant to their authority, require existing
stormwater management basins to be retrofitted to meet one or more of
the safety standards in Subsections B(1), B(2) and B(3) for trash racks,
overflow grates and escape provisions at outlet structures.
B. Requirements for trash racks, overflow grates and escape provisions.
(1) A trash rack is a device designed to catch trash and debris and
prevent the clogging of outlet structures. Trash racks shall be
installed at the intake to the outlet from the stormwater
management basin to ensure proper functioning of the basin
outlets in accordance with the following:
(a) The trash rack shall have parallel bars, with no greater than
six-inch spacing between the bars.
(b) The trash rack shall be designed so as not to adversely affect
the hydraulic performance of the outlet pipe or structure.
(c) The average velocity of flow through a clean trash rack is not to
exceed 2.5 feet per second under the full range of stage and
discharge. Velocity is to be computed on the basis of the net
area of opening through the rack.
(d) The trash rack shall be constructed and installed to be rigid,
durable and corrosion resistant and shall be designed to
withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300 pounds per
square feet.
(2) An overflow grate is designed to prevent obstruction of the
overflow structure. If an outlet structure has an overflow grate,
such grate shall meet the following requirements:
(a) The overflow grate shall be secured to the outlet structure but
removable for emergencies and maintenance.
(b) The overflow grate spacing shall be no less than two inches
across the smallest dimension.
(c) The overflow grate shall be constructed and installed to be
rigid, durable and corrosion resistant and shall be designed to
§ 258A-7 PASSAIC CODE § 258A-8

withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300 pounds per
square foot.
(3) For purposes of this Subsection, escape provisions means the
permanent installation of ladders, steps, rungs or other features
that provide easily accessible means of egress from stormwater
management basins. Stormwater management basins shall include
escape provisions as follows:
(a) If a stormwater management basin has an outlet structure,
escape provisions shall be incorporated in or on the structure.
With the prior approval of the reviewing agency identified in
Subsection C, a freestanding outlet structure may be exempted
from this requirement.
(b) Safety ledges shall be constructed on the slopes of all new
stormwater management basins having a permanent pool of
water deeper than 2 1/2 feet. Such safety ledges shall be
comprised of two steps. Each step shall be four to six feet in
width. One step shall be located approximately 2 1/2 feet below
the permanent water surface and the second step shall be
located one to 1 1/2 feet above the permanent water surface.
See Subsection D for an illustration of safety ledges in a
stormwater management basin.
(c) In new stormwater management basins, the maximum interior
slope for an earthen dam, embankment or berm shall not be
steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.
C. Variance or exemption from safety standards.
(1) A variance or exemption from the safety standards for stormwater
management basins may be granted only upon a written finding by
the appropriate reviewing agency (municipality, county or
Department) that the variance or exemption will not constitute a
threat to public safety.
D. Illustration of safety ledges in a new stormwater management basin:
A. Submission of site development stormwater plan.
(1) Whenever an applicant seeks municipal approval of a development
subject to this chapter, the applicant shall submit all of the required

each other, provided that they are placed parallel to the edge of a
roadway, and provided further that additional newsracks or groups of
newsracks shall be placed at a distance of at least 10 feet from any such
group of newsracks. The provisions in this subsection shall not apply to

§ 259-26. Abandonment.
In the event that a newsrack remains empty for a period of 30 continuous
days, it shall be deemed abandoned and shall be removed by the City. The

the date of the issuance of said summons. Any violation must be cured
within a period of 10 days from the issuance of the summons or, if a
hearing has been requested and held, at the direction of the Court.
If the violation is not so cured, the City Engineer shall notify the
distributor of the City's intent to revoke the permit for said newsrack
and to remove the newsrack five days after the issuance of the notice.
Said notice shall set forth the location where the distributor may
reclaim the newsrack after its removal. At the expiration of five days,
if the violation remains unsured, the permit shall automatically be
deemed to be revoked, and the rack shall be seized by the City. The

reasonably possible to the City Engineer, who shall thereafter notify the
distributor as soon as possible of the seizure and disposition of the
newsrack. The owner may thereafter reclaim the newsrack upon
payment of a fee of $25 and may relocate the newsrack to any location
not presenting a real and imminent danger and otherwise complying
with the terms of this article, including the requirement of a permit.
D. Issuance of a permit by the City Engineer and display by the distributor
of a valid permit sticker shall not prevent the seizure of a newsrack by
the City if the actual placement of the newsrack poses a real and
imminent threat to vehicles or pedestrians or otherwise violates this
article.
E. The City Engineer shall make provision for the appropriate storage of
newsracks seized under these regulations, but neither the City
Engineer nor the City or any other officer or employee of the City shall
be liable for any damage to such newsrack.

Design Standards
§ 263-10. Observance of requirements and principles required.
The subdivider shall observe the following requirements and principles of
land subdivision in the design of each subdivision or portion thereof.
§ 263-11. General requirements.
§ 263-12. Streets.
A. In acting upon plats, the Board shall require, among other conditions in
the public interest, that the tract shall be adequately drained and the
streets shall be of sufficient width and suitable grade and suitably
located to accommodate the prospective traffic, to provide access for
firefighting equipment to buildings and to be coordinated so as to
compose a convenient system, conforming to the Official Map or, if
there is no Official Map, relating properly to the existing street system,
and so oriented as to permit, within the limits of practicability and
feasibility, the buildings constructed thereon to maximize solar gain.
Where the Planning Board, after hearing, has adopted portions of the
Master Plan, with proposals regarding the street system within the
proposed subdivision, the Board may require that the street shown
conforms in design and in width to the proposals shown on the Master
Plan.
B. The Board shall further require that all lots shown on the plats shall be
adaptable for the intended purposes without danger to health or peril
from flood, fire, erosion or other menace.
C. If portions of the Master Plan contain proposals for drainage rights-ofway,
school, parks or playgrounds within the proposed subdivision or in
its vicinity, or if standards for the allocation of portions of subdivisions
for drainage rights-of-way, school sites, park and playground purposes
have been adopted, before approving subdivisions, the Board may
further require that such drainage rights-of-way, school sites, parks or
playgrounds be shown in locations and sizes suitable to their intended
uses. The Board shall be permitted to reserve the location and extent of
school sites, public parks and playgrounds shown on the Master Plan or
any part thereof for a period of one year after the approval of the final
plat or within such further time as agreed to by the applying party.
Unless, during such one-year period or extension thereof, the
municipality shall have entered into a contract to purchase, or
instituted condemnation proceedings according to law, for the school
site, park or playground, the subdivider shall not be bound by the
proposals for the areas shown on the Master Plan. This provision shall
not apply to the streets and roads or drainage rights-of-way required for
final approval of any plat and deemed essential to the public welfare.
§ 263-10 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 263-12
263:867
A. The arrangement of streets not shown on the Master Plan or Official
Map shall be to provide for the logical extension of existing streets and
to provide for future access for remaining land areas.
B. Minor streets shall be so designed as to discourage through traffic.
C. The minimum right-of-way width shall be measured from lot line to lot
line and shall be in accordance with the following schedule:
(1) Arterial streets: 80 feet.

(3) Minor streets: 50 feet.
(4) Marginal access streets: 50 feet.
(5) The right-of-way width for internal roads and drives in multifamily,
commercial and industrial development shall be determined on an
individual basis and shall, in all cases, be of sufficient width and
design to accommodate safely the maximum anticipated traffic,
parking and loading needs.
(6) No street of a width greater than 80 feet within the right-of-way
lines may be required, unless said street constitutes an extension of
an existing street of the greater width or already has been shown
on the Master Plan at the greater width, or already has been shown
in greater width on the Official Map.
D. No subdivision showing reserve strips controlling access to streets shall
be approved.
E. Subdivisions that adjoin or include existing streets that do not conform
to street widths, as shown on the Master Plan or Official Map, or that do
not conform to the street width requirements of this chapter shall
dedicate additional width along either one or both sides of such streets
of substandard width. If the subdivision is along one side only, 1/2 of the
required extra width shall be dedicated.
F. Grades of arterial and collector streets shall not exceed 4%. Grades on
other streets shall not exceed 10%. However, the Board shall have the
right to require grades of less than 10% where special conditions exist,
provided that the special conditions are set forth in writing upon the
minutes of the Board. No street shall have a grade of less than 1/2 of
1%.
G. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as circumstances
will allow and in no case shall be less than 60°. The block corners at
intersections shall be rounded at the curbline with a curve having a
radius of not less than 20 feet.

line.
J. A tangent, at least 100 feet long, shall be introduced between reverse
curves on arterial and collector streets.
K. When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point
by more than 10°, they shall be connected by a curve with a center line
radius of not less than 100 feet for minor streets and 300 feet for
arterial and collector streets.
L. All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical curves of sufficient
length to provide a smooth transition and proper sight distance.
M. Streets designed to dead-end permanently more than 100 feet from an
intersection shall provide a circular turnaround at the end with a rightof-
way radius of 50 feet. Such streets shall not be longer than 400 feet
from the intersection to their dead end. Streets designed to dead-end
temporarily shall be improved to the boundary of the subdivision.
N. No street shall have a name which duplicates the name of an existing
street or is so similar to the name of an existing street as to be easily
confused with it. The continuation of an existing street shall have the
same name.
A. Block length and width or acreage within bounding roads shall be such
as to accommodate the size of the lot required in the area by the Zoning
Ordinance171 and to provide for convenient access, circulation control
and safety of street traffic.
B. In blocks over 1,000 feet long, pedestrian crosswalks shall be 10 feet
wide. Lots abutting such a crosswalk shall be treated as a corner lot.
C. For commercial, group housing or industrial use, the block size shall be
sufficient in the judgment of the Board to meet all area and yard
requirements for such use.
A. All lots created by subdivision shall conform strictly to the
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance as to area and dimensions, and
as to adequacy of space and grade to provide off-street parking
requirements or other requirements specified by the Zoning Ordinance.

263:869
§ 263-15. Public uses and service areas.
In large scale developments, easements along rear property lines or
elsewhere for utility installation may be required by the Board. Such
easements shall be of the width and location determined by the Board after
consultation with the public utility companies or municipal departments
concerned. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse,
drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater
easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines
of such watercourse and such further width or construction, or both, as the
Board may deem adequate for the purpose.
§ 263-16. Construction specifications.
Curbs, gutters, sidewalks, street pavements, fire hydrants, streetlights,
shade trees, monuments, water mains, storm sewers, sanitary sewers and
any other improvements that may be required shall be designed and
constructed to conform to the specifications of the municipality.
§ 263-17. Special exceptions and modifications of standards.
Upon certification by the City Engineer that there exists exceptional
topographic conditions or other extraordinary and exceptional situations
relating to the physical condition of the land being subdivided that make
full compliance with the standards established by this chapter physically
impossible, the Board may, by resolution, make a special exception and
modify the above standards in their application to the land in question,
provided that the findings of the Board are noted in its minutes and, further,

granted who is found to be regularly utilizing on-street parking in the
immediate vicinity of the location of the restricted space that has been
provided to such individual, instead of utilizing such restricted space,
shall be subject to suspension or revocation of such restricted parking
space. No suspension or revocation shall occur prior to a hearing being
held before an Administrative Board, to consist of three persons: the
City Clerk; one head of a department, to be designated by the Business
Administrator; and the Business Administrator. Prior to such hearing,
the affected person(s) and/or firm(s) shall receive notice of said hearing

owner to file a complete application for such a permit on a form
provided by the City Clerk. An owner of a private driveway shall be
eligible to apply for up to three permits for his or her own motor
vehicles or for use by other parties authorized by the owner to park in
front of the private driveway. In the case of a private residence, each
member of the owner's household who owns a motor vehicle shall also

require an applicant to provide evidence that the driveway was legally
established in accordance with the municipal Zoning Code.

authorized to park in front of the driveway. The permit shall be 5 1/2
inches by 8 1/2 inches in size. It shall bear an appropriate certification
of authenticity and shall be displayed prominently within the vehicle
when parked so as to be seen from the middle of the street.
C. Defense.
(1) Provided that such parking is not otherwise prohibited and does
not interfere with the normal flow of traffic, it is an affirmative
defense to prosecution for a violation of N.J.S.A. 39:4-138(d) if:

are owned by the same person; or
(b) The parked vehicle is owned by a member of the same
household as the owner of the private driveway; or
(c) The owner of the private driveway authorized the parking of
the parked vehicle in front of the private driveway.

driveway without a valid driveway parking permit displayed
prominently within the vehicle when parked so as to be seen from the
middle of the street.
E. No owner may charge a fee for permitting anyone to park a vehicle in
front of the owner's driveway.

the sidewalk.

Road Work Zones
[Added 2-1-2001 by Ord. No. 1505-01]
§ 295-19.1. Statement of purpose.
In order to promote the public health, safety, peace and welfare, it is
necessary to establish controls, regulations and procedures for the safe
and expeditious movement of vehicular and pedestrian traffic through
construction and maintenance work zones along streets and highways
within the City of Passaic and to provide for the safety of the work forces
performing these operations. These work zones include all areas within
public streets through or around road/street construction, maintenance
operations and utility work above or below the ground which requires
blocking the roadway and obstructing the normal flow of traffic, and such
obstructions can become dangerous to motorists and pedestrians when not
properly controlled.
§ 295-19.2. Traffic control compliance.
All traffic signs, signals, markings and transition materials placed in public
streets to control traffic at work zones shall comply with the provisions of
the current MUTCD. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor, utility
or government agency performing work in public streets and highways to
ensure compliance with the MUTCD and to provide and maintain all of
the materials required during construction. Provision and maintenance of
safe pedestrian crossing areas shall be required whenever the construction
area impacts normal pedestrian pathways along sidewalks or at intersection
crosswalks. All construction traffic control devices are to be removed upon
completion of work.
§ 295-19.3. Preconstruction requirements.
A. Road opening permits are to be obtained for all work requiring
excavations within the roadway proper on City streets from the City
Engineer's office in compliance with Chapter 295 of the City Code and
from the Passaic County Road Department for roadway excavations on
county roads. It shall be the responsibility of the person in charge of any
construction or maintenance work to obtain the necessary permits. This
section does not apply to the City Public Works Department.
B. A preconstruction meeting is to be scheduled prior to initiation of
construction for all projects requiring any work within the confines of
any streets in the City of Passaic whenever the work involves excavation
or maintenance under or above the roadway and requires the transition
of vehicular or pedestrian traffic away from the work zone. A traffic
control plan is to be provided to the Engineer's office prior to the
preconstruction meeting for the safe movement of traffic past the work

well, the water of which is used for human consumption, has become
polluted and rendered unsafe for use, notice to discontinue the use of such
polluted water shall be sent to the owner or person in charge of such well

for such district and, unless otherwise indicated, shall be deemed to be the
minimum requirements in every instance of their application. The listing of

Whenever two standards are applicable, the standard requiring more
space shall apply.

[a] The structure has encroached upon the City right-ofway
for a stated number of years.

the Zoning Officer or his or her designee will review the
request for compliance or noncompliance with municipal and
state rules, regulations, statutes and ordinances and the truth
of the matter contained in the application and determine
whether the reason the property owner desires the
encroachment permit is acceptable. If no objections are noted,
the Zoning Officer or his or her designee shall forward the
application to the City Council for final approval and issuance
of the permit. Once a resolution authorizing such permit is
adopted by the City Council, the Zoning Officer or his or her
designee shall issue a letter authorizing the encroachment
permit. Should the Zoning Officer or his or her designee deny
the application, the property owner may appeal his request in
writing to the City Council.

shall be as hereinafter set forth. The application review and inspection
charges shall be limited only to professional charges for review of
applications, review and preparation of documents and inspections of
developments under construction and for review by outside consultants
when an application is of a nature beyond the scope of the expertise of the
professionals normally utilized by the municipality. The only costs that shall

such professionals or consultants, including normal and typical expenses
incurred in processing applications and inspecting improvements. No
applicant shall be charged for any municipal clerical or administrative
functions, overhead expenses, meeting room charges or any of the

resulting from multiplying the hourly base salary by the number of hours
spent by the respective professional upon review of the application for
development or inspection of the developer's improvements, as the case
may be.

or applied for the purposes for which it was deposited, as the case may
be, except that the municipality may retain for administrative expenses a
sum equivalent of no more than 33 1/3% of that entire amount, which shall
be in lieu of all other administrative and custodial expenses. All sums not
actually so expended shall be refunded to the applicant within 90 days after

increments, the hourly rate and the expenses incurred. All professionals
shall submit vouchers to the Chief Financial Officer of the municipality
on a monthly basis in accordance with the schedules and procedures

an informational copy of all vouchers or statements submitted to the
Chief Financial Officer of the municipality simultaneously to the

§ 317-80. Closeout procedures.
B. The Chief Financial Officer shall prepare and send to the applicant a
statement which shall include an accounting of funds listing all
deposits, interest earnings, disbursements and the cumulative balance
of the escrow account. This information shall be provided on a quarterly
basis, if monthly charges are $1,000 or less, or on a monthly basis, if
monthly charges exceed $1,000.
C. If an escrow account or deposit contains insufficient funds to enable the
municipality or approving authority to perform required application
reviews or improvement inspections, the Chief Financial Officer shall
provide the applicant with a notice of the insufficient escrow or deposit
balance. In order for work to continue on the development or the
application, the applicant shall, within a reasonable time period, post a
deposit to the account in an amount to be agreed upon by the
municipality or approving authority and the applicant. In the event the
balance falls below 25% of the initial escrow deposit, such account must
be restored to it's full balance. In the interim, any required health and
safety inspections shall be made and charged back against the
replenishment of funds.
A. The following closeout procedures shall apply to all deposits and
escrow accounts established under the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1
et seq. and shall commence after the approving authority has granted
final approval and signed the subdivision plat or site plan, in the case of
application review escrows and deposits, or after the improvements
have been approved in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53, in the case of improvement
inspection escrows and deposits.
B. The applicant shall send written notice by certified mail to the Chief
Financial Officer of the municipality and the approving authority and to
the relevant municipal professional that the application or the
improvements, as the case may be, are completed. After receipt of such
notice, the professional shall render a final bill to the Chief Financial
Officer of the municipality within 30 days and shall send a copy
simultaneously to the applicant. The Chief Financial Officer of the
municipality shall render a written final accounting to the applicant on
the uses to which the deposit was put within 45 days of receipt of the
final bill. Any balances remaining in the deposit or escrow account,
including interest in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.1, shall be
refunded to the developer along with the final accounting.

If the municipality retains a different professional or consultant in the place
of a professional originally responsible for development application review
or inspection of improvements, the municipality or approving authority
shall be responsible for all time and expenses of the new professional to
become familiar with the application or the project, and the municipality or
approving authority shall not bill the applicant or charge to the deposit or
the escrow account for any such services.
§ 317-83. Estimate of cost of improvements.
The cost of the installation of improvements for the purposes of N.J.S.A.
40:55D-53 shall be estimated by the Municipal Engineer based on
documented construction costs for the public improvements prevailing in
the general area of the municipality. The developer may appeal the
Municipal Engineer's estimate to the County Construction Board of Appeals,
established pursuant to N.J.S.A. 52:27D-127.
§ 317-84. Appeals.
A. All professional charges for review of an application for development,
review and preparation of documents or inspection of improvements
shall be reasonable and necessary, given the status and progress of the
application or construction. Review fees shall be charged only in
connection with an application for development presently pending
before the approving authority or upon review of compliance with the
conditions of approval, or review of requests for modification or
amendment made by the applicant. A professional shall not review
items which are subject to approval by any state governmental agency
and not under the municipality.
B. Limitation of inspection fees. Inspection fees shall be charged only for
actual work shown on a subdivision or site plan or required by an
approving resolution. Professionals inspecting improvements under
construction shall charge only for inspections that are reasonably
necessary to check the progress and quality of the work, and such
inspections shall be reasonably based on the approved development
plans and documents.
A. An applicant shall notify in writing the governing body with copies to
the Chief Financial Officer, the approving authority and the professional
whenever the applicant disputes the charges made by a professional for
a service rendered to the municipality in reviewing applications for
development, review and preparation of documents, inspection of
improvements or other charges made pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2.
The governing body or its designee shall within a reasonable time
attempt to remediate any disputed charges. If the matter is not resolved
to the satisfaction of the applicant, the applicant may appeal to the

§ A321-20. Public, educational and governmental access.

the company's rights with respect to using the channel for non-PEG
programming shall be subordinate to the City's provision of PEG access
programming on such channel.

of transmission of the PEG access programming provided for in this

Cablevision shall pay a grant to the City in the amount of $10,000. In
the third year and each of the following years of the term of the
ordinance through year 15 of the consent, the company shall pay an
"annual grant" of $5,000 to the City. The annual grant shall be payable
to the City within 30 days of the payment of the annual franchise fee.

the City deems appropriate, provided that: a) such uses are lawful and
consistent with the terms of this ordinance; and b) if used to purchase
communications services, the City shall seek to purchase such services
from the company or its affiliates, if offered. On request, the City shall
provide Cablevision with a certification of compliance with this
subsection.

payments due and payable after the date upon which the company
