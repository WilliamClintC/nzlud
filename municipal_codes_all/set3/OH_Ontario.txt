EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR'S NOTE:  Source material for the Ontario Codified Ordinances was
either ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by
the Adopting Ordinance.  Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any
history indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance.  In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Ontario Codified Ordinances is indicated.

   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein. 
(ORC 1.57)
 
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance. 
(ORC 1.54)
 
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture or

   101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
 
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. 
(ORC 1.46)
 
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendmant, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
   101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.  (ORC 1.48)
 
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained:
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provision, including laws upon
the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the Municipality,
any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense or a
misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the failure to do
any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is otherwise
provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a fine not
exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be deemed
committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

   121.07  PUBLIC PURPOSE FOR SUNDRY ACCOUNTS.
   (a)   Council hereby finds and determines that the public health, safety,
welfare and general prosperity of the residents of this City will be enhanced

these goals, the provision of meals and incidental expenses, excluding the
purchase of alcoholic beverages, by City officials as part of the process of
attracting new businesses to Ontario from funds appropriated in the Mayor's and
Council's sundry accounts serves a public purpose of this City and is hereby
declared to be a proper and lawful expenditure of public money.
   (b)   No expenditure shall be approved and no reimbursement shall be made
for any expenditure defined in subsection (a) hereof unless original receipts
are submitted to the Auditor along with documentation detailing the reason for
the meals and incidental expenses, the participants attending, the company and/

to satisfy IRS Regulations pertaining to such expenditures.

Treasurer and shall be expended only for the purpose for which the gift or
grant was received.  All non-financial gifts shall be delivered to the

(Ord. 05-66.  Passed 10-20-05; Ord. 17-32.  Passed 10-18-17.)
   137.03  IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to comply with 16 CFR §681.2
in order to establish procedures to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft
by identifying and detecting identity theft red flags and by responding to such
red flags in a manner that will prevent identity theft.
   (b)   Definitions.  For purposes of this section, the following definitions
apply:
      (1)   “City” means the City of Ontario, Richland County, Ohio.
      (2)   “Covered account” means:
         A.   An account that a financial institution or creditor offers or
maintains, primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, that involves
or is designed to permit multiple payments or transactions, such as a credit
card account, mortgage loan, automobile loan, margin account, cell phone
account, utility account, checking account, or savings account; and
         B.   Any other account that the financial institution or creditor
offers or maintains for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to
consumers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or
creditor from identity theft, including financial, operational, compliance,
reputation, or litigation risks.
      (3)   “Credit” means the right granted by a creditor to a debtor to defer
payment of debt or to incur debts and defer its payment or to purchase property
or services and defer payment therefor.
      (4)   “Creditor” means any person who regularly extends, renews, or
continues credit; any person who regularly arranges for the extension, renewal,
or continuation of credit; or any assignee of an original creditor who
participates in the decision to extend, renew, or continue credit and includes
utility companies and telecommunications companies.
      (5)   “Customer” means a person that has a covered account with a
creditor.
      (6)   “Identity theft” means a fraud committed or attempted using
identifying information of another person without authority.
      (7)   “Person” means a natural person, a corporation, government or
governmental subdivision or agency, trust, estate, partnership, cooperative or
association.
      (8)   “Personal identifying information” means a person’s credit card
account information, debit card information, bank account information, and
drivers’ license information and for a natural person includes their social
security number, mother’s birth name, and date of birth.
      (9)   “Red flag” means a pattern, practice or specific activity that
indicates the possible existence of identity theft.
      (10)   “Service provider” means a person that provides a service directly
to the City.
   (c)   Findings.
      (1)   The City is a creditor pursuant to 16 CFR §681.2 due to providing
or maintaining covered accounts for which payment is made in arrears.
      (2)   The covered accounts offered to customers for the provision of the
City services are water accounts and sewer accounts.
      (3)   The City’s previous experience with identity theft related to
covered accounts is as follows: The City has never had a reported incident of
identity theft involving one of its water accounts or sewer accounts.
      (4)   The processes of opening a new covered account and managing an
existing covered account have been identified as potential processes in which
identity theft could occur.
      (5)   The City limits access to Personal Identifying Information to those
employees responsible for or otherwise involved in opening, managing or
accepting payments on covered accounts.
      (6)   The City does not currently provide any electronic access to
covered accounts by customers.
      (7)   The City establishes primary responsibility for its water accounts
and sewer accounts with the record owner of the property.  The City will, at
the owner’s request, bill a tenant as the owner’s agent for billing purposes
and without releasing the owner from primary liability for payment.  The
primary exception to limiting sewer accounts to the record owner of the
property is that the City will establish an account with a land contract vendee
whose interest appears on the public records.
      (8)   The City determines that there is a low risk of identity theft
occurring in the following ways (if any):
         A.   Use by an applicant of another person’s personal identifying
information to establish a new covered account;
         B.   Use of a previous customer’s personal identifying information by
another person in an effort to have service restored in the previous customer’s
name;
         C.   Use of another person’s credit card, bank account, or other
method of payment by a customer to pay such customer’s covered account or
accounts; and
         D.   Use by a customer desiring to restore such customer’s covered
account of another person’s credit card, bank account, or other method of
payment.
   (d)   Sources, Types and Identification of Red Flags.  Based upon the
methods by which the City opens and manages accounts, and the lack of any past
experience with identity theft, the following events or occurrences shall be
considered as “Red Flags” and indicators of possible identity theft.  Although
the City does not currently use all of the methods or services described below,
it has included them as possible Red Flags in the event it chooses to use such
reports or services in the future.
      (1)   Suspicious documents, including, without limitation:
         A.   Documents that appear to be altered or forged;
         B.   Documents on which the photograph or physical description is
inconsistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the
identification;
         C.   Documents with information inconsistent with other information
provided by the person opening an account or presenting identification.
         D.   Documents on which the information is inconsistent with readily
accessible information that is on file with the City; or
         E.   An application that appears to have been altered or forged, or
appears to have been destroyed and reassembled.
      (2)   Suspicious personal identification, including, without limitation:
         A.   Personal identifying information that is inconsistent with
external information sources used by the City, such as:
            1.   The address does not match any address in other records or a
consumer report; or
            2.   The Social Security Number (SSN) has not been issued, or is
listed on the Social Security Administration’s Death Master File.
         B.   Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not
consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the
customer, such as a lack of correlation between the SSN range and date of
birth.
         C.   Personal identifying information or a phone number or address, is
associated with known fraudulent application or activities as indicated by
internal or third-party sources used by the City.
         D.   Other information provided, such as fictitious mailing address,
mail drop addresses, jail addresses, invalid phone numbers, pager numbers or
answering services, is associated with fraudulent activity.
         E.   The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other
applicants or customers.
         F.   The address or telephone number provided is the same as or
similar to the account number or telephone number submitted by an unusually
large number of applicants or customers.
         G.   The applicant or customer fails to provide all required
identifying information on an application or in response to notification that
the application is incomplete.
         H.   Identifying information is not consistent with identifying
information that is on file with the City.
         I.   The applicant or customer cannot provide authenticating
information beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet or
consumer report.
      (3)   Unusual use of or suspicious activity relating to a covered
account, including, without limitation:
         A.   Shortly following the notice of a change of address for an
account, the City receives a request to change or add authorized persons on the
account.
         B.   An account is used in a manner that is not consistent with
established patterns of activity on the account, such as nonpayment where there
is no history or late or missed payments.
         C.   An account that has been inactive for a long period of time
(taking into consideration the type of account, the expected pattern of usage
and other relevant factors).
         D.   Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable
although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the
customer’s account.
         E.   The City is notified that the customer is not receiving paper
account statements.
         F.   The City is notified of unauthorized charges or transactions in
connection with a customer’s account.
         G.   The City is notified by a customer, law enforcement or another
person that it has opened a fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity
theft.
      (4)   Notice from customers, law enforcement, victims or other reliable
sources regarding possible identity theft or phishing relating to covered
accounts.
      (5)   Alerts, notifications or warnings from a consumer reporting agency
or other fraud detection service, including, without limitation:
         A.   A fraud or active duty alert that is included with a consumer
report;
         B.   A notice of credit freeze in response to a request for a consumer
report;
         C.   A notice of address discrepancy provided by a consumer reporting
agency;
         D.   Indications of a pattern of activity in a consumer report that is
inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an applicant or
customer, such as:
            1.   A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
            2.   An unusual number of recently established credit
relationships;
            3.   A material change in the use of credit, especially with
respect to recently established credit relationships; or
            4.   An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse
of account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
   (e)   Detecting Red Flags When Opening New Accounts and Managing Existing
Accounts.  The City’s water and sewer services operations and customers are
concentrated in and around the City territorial limits.  However, the City also
provides water and sewer service to properties owned by persons who do not
reside in the local area.  The City’s experience reflects that significant or
regular face-to-face contact between City staff and customers can be helpful
but is not necessary given the nature and scope of its activities.  The City
has a history of relatively low losses due to nonpayment. The City has never
had a reported incident of identity theft related to a covered account.  The
City will use a combination of documentary and nondocumentary methods to verify
the identity of new customers and to authenticate existing customers.
      (1)   To open a water account or sewer account with the City, City
personnel will take the following steps to obtain and verify the identity of
the person opening the account:
         A.   Require identifying information, including, without limitation,
name, the service address, the billing address if different from the service
address, and contact information for the customer.
         B.   Verify the customer’s identity by documentary or nondocumentary
means, or a combination of them;
         C.   For customers which are not a natural person, identify the person
(s) with authority over the account; and
         D.   Independently contact the customer.
      (2)   In managing an existing sewer account, City personnel will:
         A.   Verify the identity of customers if they request information;
         B.   Verify the validity of requests to change a billing address;
         C.   Verify the validity of requests to make other modifications
regarding the account. 
      (3)   In order to implement the general detection guidelines set forth
above for both new and existing accounts, the City has created various
verification procedures, which vary depending upon the type of account.  See
Appendix A attached to original Ordinance 09-16 and incorporated by reference.
   (f)   Prevention and Mitigation of Identity Theft.
      (1)   In the event City personnel detect any identified Red Flags, such
personnel shall take one or more of the following steps, depending on the
degree of risk posed by the Red Flag:
         A.   Continue to monitor an account for evidence of Identity Theft;
         B.   Contact the customer;
         C.   Change any passwords or other security devices that permit access
to accounts;

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap. 
171.  Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE:  The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).  Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months.  "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
      In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases. 
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above.  Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973):  "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C).  If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipalty and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality.  Guilty and no contest pleasmay be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is
set forth in Rule 9(C):  "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's ourt shall
make a written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any.  Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case.  Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic
   violation bureau and specifies certain restrictions as to the designated
offenses and schedule of fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of
court appearance.

   191.04  DETERMINATION OF TAX ALLOCATION.
   (a)   Method of Determination.
      (1)   In the taxation of income which is subject to City income taxes, if
the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or profession both
within and without the boundaries of the City disclose with reasonable accuracy
what portion of its net profit is attributable to that part of the business or
profession conducted within the boundaries of the City, then only such portion
shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the City for the purposes of
Municipal income taxation. The portion of the entire net profits of a taxpayer
to be allocated as having been derived from within the City, in the absence of
actual records thereof, shall be determined as follows:
   Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to be
determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight as follows:
A.   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal property
owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the City during
the taxable period to the average net book value of all the real and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in this subsection (a)(1)A, "real property" means property rented or
leased by the taxpayer. The value of such property shall be determined by
multiplying the annual rental thereof by eight.
B.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to
persons employed in the business or profession for services performed in the
City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the same period to
persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their services are
performed.
C.   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and services
performed during the taxable period in the City to gross receipts of the
business or profession during the same period from sales and services, wherever
made or performed.
(2)   In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
so as to produce such result.
   (b)   Sales Made in the City.  As used in subsection (a)(1)C hereof, "sales
made in the City" means:
      (1)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the City regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a stock
of goods within the City;
      (2)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the City regardless of where title passes even though transported from a point
outside the City, if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City, and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion;
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the City to purchasers outside of the City regardless of where
title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly
engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery
is made.
      (4)   The net profit from all sales of real property within the City by
persons not residing within the property sold and sold in the ordinary course
of a business or occupation.
   (c)   Total Allocation. Add together the percentages determined in
accordance with subsection (b) hereof, or such of the aforesaid as are
applicable to the particular taxpayer and divide the total so obtained by the
number of percentages used in deriving the total in order to obtain the
business allocation percentage referred to in Section
191.03 (a).
   A factor is applicable only if it may be allocable inside the City.
   (d)   Rentals.  Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in
the computation of net profits from business activities under subsection (a)
hereof, only if and to the extent that the rental, ownership, management, or
operations of the real estate from which such rentals are derived, whether so
rented, managed, or operated by a taxpayer individually or through agents or
other representatives, constitutes a  business activity of the taxpayer in
whole or in part.
(Ord. 97-60. Passed 11-20-97.)
   191.05  OPERATING LOSSES.
   (a)   No portion of a net operating loss shall be carried back against net
profits of any prior year nor allowed to be carried forward to a subsequent
year.
   (b)   No current business operating loss shall be used to off-set W-
2 income.

   (a)   An Ontario Job Creation Tax Credit (Ontario JCTC) is hereby created
within the City of Ontario which may be authorized by the Council of the City
of Ontario by Ordinance for individual companies that meet the following
minimum thresholds:
      (1)   Eligible Companies - Any non-point of final purchase retail
project, which  commits to the creation of new, full-time, or full-time
equivalent jobs in the City of Ontario. These new, full-time, or full-time
equivalent jobs must be created, and maintained, by the company (Company)
within three years of the granting of the Ontario JCTC incentive.  An eligible
company must currently be paying, or will be paying, municipal incomes taxes.
      (2)   Eligible Projects - Eligible projects may include headquarter,
manufacturing, science and technology, research and development, distribution,
and certain types of service projects that have applied for State of Ohio
development assistance.
      (3)   Repealed
      (4)   At least 10 new, full-time jobs must be created and maintained by
the  Company within three years of initial operations.  If employment
subsequently falls below 10 new full-time jobs, the credit may only continue if
the Ohio JCTC is allowed to continue by the State of Ohio.
      (5)   The average hourly base wage rate (excluding benefits) of the
project's new, full-time, or full-time equivalent jobs for three years must be
at, or above, 150% of the higher of the U.S. Federal minimum wage or the Ohio
minimum wage (average income jobs).
      (6)   If the project involves an expansion or consolidation of an
existing facility, the Company must commit to retaining the current number of
employees.  The Ontario JCTC will apply only to the net new, full-time, or
full-time equivalent positions in the project within the City of Ontario.
      (7)   The project must involve a substantial fixed-asset investment in
land,  building, machinery/equipment, and/or infrastructure.
      (8)   The project must not have already begun.  The applicant shall not
make a public announcement of the proposed project prior to receiving JCTC
program approvals from both the State of Ohio and the Ontario City Council.
Employees hired prior to the above-referenced approvals cannot be counted as
eligible, new employees for the purpose of the tax credit programs.
   (b)   For companies meeting the above criteria when approved by City
Council, the following criteria shall apply:
      (1)   Refundable income tax credits shall be established by a written
Ontario Jobs Creation Tax Credit Agreement with each Company as authorized by
Ordinance of City Council.  The tax credit under this Agreement shall not
exceed ten (10) years.
      (2)   The rate of each tax credit will be established by the Ontario City
Council, which may grant a higher rate for a company that will have a
combination of high paying jobs and/or a large number of jobs.  Consideration
of the location of the project and the difficulty in occupying the site also
may be considered.  In no case shall the Ontario JCTC credit exceed 50% of the
additional income tax revenue generated from the jobs associated with the
application.
      (3)   The tax credit shall be measured by the income taxes actually
collected from the qualifying new jobs and may be applied against the tax on
the Company's net profits.
      (4)   Under no circumstances shall the term of the tax credit exceed that
provided to the applicant under the State of Ohio Jobs Creation Tax Credit
Agreement as authorized by the Ohio R.C. 122.17.
      (5)   Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the Ontario Jobs
Creation Tax Credit Agreement may result in the loss of subsequent credit for
the duration of the agreement by action of the City Council after notice and an
opportunity to respond.  The Agreement shall contain terms and provisions for
the recovery or "claw back" to address situations in which the Company moves
out of the City of Ontario during the term required in subsection (a)(9)
hereof.  Recovery and "claw back" being the repayment of all or a portion of
previous granted tax credits or refunds.  The Agreement shall also provide for
annual review by Council to determine compliance.
      (6)   The participant shall comply with all applicable Municipal Codes,
Regulations and Rules.  Further, the Company shall provide copies of all
required reports to the Ohio Department of Development, in duplicate to City
Council, required as a part of the obligations and terms of the Ohio JCTC.

   192.01  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have
the following meanings ascribed to them respectively:
   (a)    "Administrator" means the Tax Administrator of the City of Ontario.
   (b)    "Hotel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised
or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are
offered for a consideration to guests, in which five or more rooms are used for
the accommodation of guests, whether the rooms are in one or several
structures.  “Hotel” means a transient hotel, extended stay hotel, or
residential hotel.
   (c)   "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or
possession of any room or rooms, or space or portion thereof, in any hotel for
dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or right to use
or possess any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office space, banquet
or private dining rooms, or exhibit, sample or display space shall not be
considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition unless the person
exercising the right uses or possesses, or has the right to use or possess, all
or any portion of the room or suite of rooms for dwelling, lodging or sleeping
purposes.
   (d)    "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether
in the capacity of owner, lessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any
other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing
agent of any type or character, other than an employee, the managing agent
shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall
have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the
provisions of  this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent
shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.
   (e)    "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,

corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any
other group or combination acting as a unit.

credits and property or services of any kind or nature, and also any amount for
which the occupant is liable for the occupancy without any deduction therefrom
whatsoever. 
   (g)    “Temporary guest” means a person occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations and not for a permanent or principal residence.
      (Ord. 14-46.  Passed 9-18-14.)
   192.02  RATE OF TAX.
   (a)    Commencing on May 15, 2005, there is levied a tax of three percent
(3%) on all rents received by a hotel for lodging furnished to temporary guests
with fifty percent (50%) of the  total receipts applied to the Capital
Improvement Fund and twenty-five percent (25%) to the General Fund and twenty-
five percent (25%) to the Economic Development Fund.
   (b)    This tax constitutes a debt owed by the temporary guest to the City,
which is extinguished only by payment to the operator as trustee for the City,
or to the City. The temporary guest shall pay the tax to the operator of the
hotel at the time the rent is paid.  If the rent is paid in installments, a
proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid
tax shall be due upon the temporary guest ceasing to occupy space in the hotel.
   If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the
Administrator may require that the tax be paid directly to the Administrator.
(Ord. 14-46.  Passed 9-18-14.)

claims of exemption under subsection (a)(3) hereof shall be made in the manner
prescribed by the Administrator.
(Ord. 14-46.  Passed 9-18-14.)
   192.04  TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   (a)   The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from
the rent and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the
occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of
occupancy, or any bill or statement or charge made for an occupancy issued or
delivered by the operator, and the tax shall be paid by the occupant to the
operator as trustee for and on account of the City, and the operator shall be
liable for the collection thereof and for the tax.
   (b)    No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner,
whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be
assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent,

   192.06  REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   Each operator shall, on or before the fifteenth day of each month, make a
return to the Administrator, on forms provided by the Administrator, of the
total rents charged and received, and the amount of tax collected for temporary
occupancies during the preceding calendar month. All claims for exemptions from
the tax filed by occupants with the operator during the reporting period shall
be filed with the report. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of
the tax collected shall be remitted to the Administrator. The Administrator may
require further information in the return if the information is pertinent to
the collection of the tax. Returns and payments are due immediately upon
cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant
to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the City until

thirty day period shall be added for each successive thirty day period that the
account remains delinquent.
   (c)    Fraud.  If the Administrator determines that the nonpayment of any
remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to twenty-
five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition
to the penalties stated in subsection (a) hereof.
   (d)    Interest. In addition to the previous penalties imposed, any operator
who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the
rate of one percent (1%) per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of the
tax exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became
delinquent until paid.
   (e)   Penalties During Pendency of Hearing or Appeal.  No penalty provided
under the terms of this chapter shall be imposed during the pendency of any

   If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make, within the
time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax, or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Director shall proceed in such
manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his
estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Director procures such facts and
information upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this
chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the
same and to make a report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and
assess against the operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by
this chapter. In case such determination is made, the Administrator shall give
notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally, or by depositing it
in the U. S. mail postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his
last known place of address. The operator may within ten days after the serving
or mailing of the notice make application in writing to the Administrator for a
hearing on the amount assessed. If an application by the operator for a hearing
is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if
any, determined by the Administrator, shall become final and conclusive, and
immediately due and payable. If an application is made, the Administrator shall
give not less than five days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to
the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the
amount specified therein should not be fixed for the tax, interest and
penalties. At the hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why the
specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After the
hearing, the Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted, and
shall give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of the
determination and the amount of the tax, interest and penalties. The amount
determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days, unless an appeal is

of Review by filing a notice of appeal with the Administrator within fifteen
days of the serving or mailing of the determination of the tax due. The Board
shall fix a time and place for hearing the appeal and shall give notice in
writing to the operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the
Board shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for
service of a notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately
due and payable upon the service of notice.

date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Administrator.
   (b)    An operator may claim a refund or take as a credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Administrator that the person from whom the tax has been
collected was not a guest; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a
credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either
been refunded to the guest or credited to rent subsequently payable by the
guest to the operator.
   (c)    A guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid, or paid more than
once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City, by filing
a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a) hereof, but only when the tax

Sub HB 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by Governor Kasich
on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal corporations to conform to
and adopt the provisions of ORC 718 in order to have the authority to impose,
enforce, administer and collect a municipal income tax.
   (B)   As mandated by H.B. 5, municipal income tax Ordinance 15-45, effective
January 1, 2016, comprehensively amends Chapter

continue the income tax and withholding tax administration and collection
efforts on behalf of the Municipality.

States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   For purposes of this Section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.

income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (B)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division  (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of
intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition
of property described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      (C)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or

reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.

section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable
year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in

payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of

   193.051 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; WITHHOLDING FROM QUALIFYINGWAGES.
   (A)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
section
 193.052 of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section.  An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         (a)     Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not
required to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end
of each calendar quarter.
         (b)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payment under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be made
so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen
days after the last day of each month.      
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator.  A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under section
193.091 of this Chapter,
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required  under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal

one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the

perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)    The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in section
193.051 of this Chapter.
               (d)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)     For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day.  For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
193.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of section
193.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (5)    If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties

until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no

If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and

      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the

amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be

person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding

lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.

      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax

   193.061 DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer. 
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
193.03(23). 
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
 193.03(1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section

   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under section
193.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)      (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the

      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the

corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the

property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned

received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)     An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation.  The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section 193.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)     If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
193.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation.  In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation. 
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.

193.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in

the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
193.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so

federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
193.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated

make the computations required under Section
 193.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in

any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.

"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the

be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the

the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established

of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under

that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are

   193.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but

limitation on refunds as provided in Section
 193.096 of this Chapter. 
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality.  To the extent a

representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the

individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or

contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (E)    No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall

      (5)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date

Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual,  no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
193.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
193.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
193.092 of this Chapter prevails. 
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) of Section
193.051 of this Chapter.
      (1)    If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment.  For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in section
 193.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld. 
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person.    Authorization by the taxpayer
of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)     When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in section
193.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. 
The tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer
who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation.  The affidavit also shall include the
following statement:  "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year.  If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules."  The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year.  It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with
the provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of
municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an
affidavit has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. 
Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from
performing an audit of the person.

otherwise due to the Municipality  before the one hundred eighty-first day
after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require

with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an
executive order issued by the President of the United States or an act of the

division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension

the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.  (Ord. 15-45.  Passed 11-19-15.)
   193.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)     Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal

withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)     The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)     Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.

return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
   (B)     Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax

income tax return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return.  If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)     An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)     If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the

      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
section 1930.19 of this Chapter  has not expired for a previously filed return.

need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in section
193.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.  (Ord. 15-45.  Passed 11-19-15.)
   193.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing.  Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses. 
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section 193.18 of this
Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)     The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
 193.10 of this Chapter.
   (E)     As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as

of this Municipality..
   (C)   The Municipality shall impose on a taxpayer, employer, any agent of

alternative dates for the audit.

entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.

document, the person shall round all amounts entered on the document. 
(Ord. 15-45.  Passed 11-19-15.)

   193.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM  AND PAYMENT
OVER TIME.
   (A)     As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due. 
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized.  The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.  (Ord. 15-45.  Passed
11-19-15.)
   193.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter.  Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information. 
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to section
193.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
section
 193.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to section
193.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in section
193.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
193.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 15-45.  Passed 11-19-15.)
   193.14  CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 15-45.  Passed 11-19-15.)
   193.15  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with  the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,

this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
              (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of section
193.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 15-45.  Passed 11-19-15.)
   193.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 15-45.  Passed 11-19-15.)
   193.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.

Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code

elected officials, or contractors with the Municipality at any time during
their term or in the five years immediately preceding the date of appointment.
One member shall be appointed by the top administrative official of the
Municipality. This member may be an employee of the Municipality, but may not
be the director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or
other similar official or an employee directly involved in municipal tax
matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code. 
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)     If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place.  This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)     No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)     A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination.  The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review.  Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code.  For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing.  Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code.  For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.

limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
193.18 of this Chapter.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent

Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.

any claim for refund upon final  determination of the appeal.   
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section

(Ord. 15-45.  Passed 11-19-15.)
   193.21  JOB CREATION TAX CREDIT.
   (A)     An Ontario Job Creation Tax Credit (Ontario JCTC) is hereby created
within the City of Ontario which may be authorized by the Council of the City
of Ontario by Ordinance for individual companies that meet the following
minimum thresholds:
      (1)   Eligible Companies - Any non-point of final purchase retail
project, which commits to the creation of new, full-time, or full-time
equivalent jobs in the City of Ontario.  These new, full- time, or full-time
equivalent jobs must be created, and maintained, by the company (Company)
within three years of the granting of the Ontario JCTC incentive.  An eligible
company must currently be paying, or will be paying, municipal incomes taxes. 
      (2)   Eligible Projects - Eligible projects may include headquarter,
manufacturing, science and technology, research and development, distribution,
and certain types of service projects that have applied for State of Ohio
development assistance. 
      (3)   At least 10 new, full-time jobs must be created and maintained by
the Company within three years of initial operations.  If employment
subsequently falls below 10 new full-time jobs, the credit may only continue if
the Ohio JCTC is allowed to continue by the State of Ohio. 
      (4)   The average hourly base wage rate (excluding benefits) of the
project's new, full-time, or full-time equivalent jobs for three years must be
at, or above, 150% of the higher of the U.S. Federal minimum wage or the Ohio
minimum wage (average income jobs).
      (5)   If the project involves an expansion or consolidation of an
existing facility, the company must commit to retaining the current number of
employees.  The Ontario JCTC will apply only to the net new, full-time, or
full-time equivalent positions in the project within the City of Ontario. 
      (6)   The project must involve a substantial fixed-asset investment in
land, building, machinery/equipment, and/or infrastructure. 
      (7)   The project must not have already begun.  The applicant shall not
make a public announcement of the proposed project prior to receiving JCTC
program approvals from both the State of Ohio and the Ontario City Council. 
Employees hired prior to the above-referenced approvals cannot be counted as
eligible, new employees for the purpose of the tax credit programs. 
   (B)   For companies meeting the above criteria when approved by City
Council, the following criteria shall apply:
      (1)   Refundable income tax credits shall be established by a written
Ontario Jobs Creation Tax Credit Agreement with each Company as authorized by
Ordinance of City Council.  The tax credit under this Agreement shall not
exceed ten (10) years.
      (2)   The rate of each tax credit will be established by the Ontario City
Council, which may grant a higher rate for a company that will have a
combination of high paying jobs and/or a large number of jobs.  Consideration
of the location of the project and the difficulty in occupying the site also
may be considered.  In no case shall the Ontario JCTC credit exceed 50% of the
additional income tax revenue generated from the jobs associated with the
application.
      (3)   The tax credit shall be measured by the income taxes actually
collected from the qualifying new jobs and may be applied against the tax on
the Company's net profits.
      (4)   Under no circumstances shall the term of the tax credit exceed that
provided to the applicant under the State of Ohio Jobs Creation Tax Credit
Agreement as authorized by the Ohio R.C. 122.17.
      (5)   Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the Ontario Jobs
Creation Tax Credit Agreement may results in the loss of subsequent credit for
the duration of the agreement by action of the City Council after notice and an
opportunity to respond.  The Agreement shall contain terms and provisions for
the recovery or "claw back" to address situations in which the Company moves
out of the City of Ontario during the term required in subsection (a) (9)
hereof.  Recovery and "claw back" being the repayment of all or a portion of
previous granted tax credits or refunds.  The Agreement shall also provide for
annual review by Council to determine compliance. 
      (6)   The participant shall comply with all applicable Municipal Codes,
Regulations and Rules.  Further, the Company shall provide copies of all
required reports to the Ohio Department of Development, in duplicate to City
Council, required as a part of the obligations and terms of the Ohio JCTC.

      (2)    The commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to sections
718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code, sections

prescribed by the tax commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
         (c)    Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the

   (C)    The tax commissioner shall enforce and administer sections
193.80 to

      (2)    Adopt such rules as the tax commissioner finds necessary to carry

      (3)    Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out

   (D)    The tax commissioner shall not be considered a tax administrator, as
that term is defined in section 718.01 of the Revised Code and Section
193.01 of the City Codified Ordinances.  (Ord. 18-02.  Passed 1-17-18.)
   193.81  DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in sections
193.80 to
193.95 of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII
of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703. of the Revised
Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference
in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this
section and section
193.01 of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall control
for all uses of that term in sections
193.80 to
193.95 of the Codified Ordinances.
   As used in sections
193.80 to
193.95 of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (A)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under section
193.82 of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
   (B)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code and
section
193.01 of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
section
193.86 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with (E)(3)(b) of section
193.86 of the Codified Ordinances.
   If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (47)(B) of section
193.03 of the Codified Ordinances, and is not a publicly traded partnership
that has made the election described in division (23)(D) of section
193.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal
taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation,
except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a
partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former
member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in
consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under
section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations.
Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with
respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health
insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance
for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or
former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
   Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in section
193.03(47)(A) of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not
include natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter
5745. of the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or
trustees in bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a
taxpayer.
   (D)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to sections
193.80 to
193.95 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal income
taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of sections
193.80 to
193.95 of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to section
193.90 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (Ord. 18-02.  Passed 1-17-18.)
   193.82  APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the City and that has made the election under section
193.80 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
City for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under section
193.011 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the City, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may require, that
the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of section
193.90 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of section
193.90 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the City as
follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the City only if, regardless of where title passes, the property
meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the City from a
stock of goods located within the City.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the City from a location
outside the City, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
City to the extent that such services are performed in the City.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the City  shall be sitused to the City.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the City.
   (E)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the City in which
the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent or
broker shall be allocated to the City based upon the ratio of the commissions
the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
located in the City to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or
lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (C)(12) and (R)(1)(d) of section
193.01 of the Codified Ordinances by the City or substantially similar
provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation, the
taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's
net profit that was apportioned to the City. In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to the City any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City under this
section.
   (G)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity. 
      (Ord. 18-02.  Passed 1-17-18.)

   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by the Codified Ordinances is
confidential, and no person shall disclose such information, except for
official purposes, in accordance with a proper judicial order, or as provided
in section 4123.271 or 5703.21 of the Revised Code. The tax commissioner may
furnish the internal revenue service with copies of returns filed. This section
does not prohibit the publication of statistics in a form which does not
disclose information with respect to particular taxpayers.
   (B)    In May and November of each year, the tax commissioner shall provide
the City tax administrator with the following information for every taxpayer
that filed tax returns with the commissioner under sections
193.80 to

shall provide to the City a report stating the name and federal identification
number of every taxpayer that made estimated payments that are attributable to
the City and the amount of each such taxpayer's estimated payment.

shall be provided to the individual or individuals designated by the City tax
administrator under section 718.83(D) of the Revised Code.

section 718.84(E) of the Revised Code, provide tax returns and other
information it receives in the performance of its administration of the
municipal net profits tax for taxpayers making the election provided in section
193.80 of the Codified Ordinances. The tax administrator shall review these
returns and information, as well as the information received pursuant to
divisions (B) and (C) of this section, and has discretion to refer any taxpayer
for audit by the tax commissioner. Such referral shall be made on a form
prescribed by the commissioner and shall include any information that forms the
basis for the referral.
      (2)    If the tax commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the tax administrator under this section, the City reserves its right to pursue
any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure that the correct
tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.
         (Ord. 18-02.  Passed 1-17-18.)
   193.84  FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (A)   (1)    For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual
return. Such return, along with the amount of tax shown to be due on the return
less the amount paid for the taxable year under section
193.88 of the Codified Ordinances, shall be submitted to the tax commissioner,
on a form and in the manner prescribed by the commissioner, on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the taxpayer's taxable
year.
      (2)    If a taxpayer has multiple taxable years ending within one
calendar year, the taxpayer shall aggregate the facts and figures necessary to
compute the tax due under this chapter, in accordance with sections
193.81,
193.82, and, if applicable,
193.86 of the Codified Ordinances onto its annual return.
      (3)    The remittance shall be made payable to the treasurer of state and
in the form prescribed by the tax commissioner. If the amount payable with the
tax return is ten dollars or less, no remittance is required.
   (B)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's identification number. Each return shall be verified by a
declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   (a)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to include, with
each annual tax return, amended return, or request for refund filed with the
commissioner under sections
193.80 to
193.95 of the Codified Ordinances, copies of any relevant documents or other
information.
         (b)    A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically
through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the tax
commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division
electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if electronic submission
is not available, mail the documents to the tax commissioner. The department of
taxation shall publish a method of electronically submitting the documents
required under this division on or before January 1, 2019.
      (3)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the tax commissioner may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal income tax.
   (D)   (1)   (a)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a tax return with the
commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)    An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)    If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with section
193.04 of the Codified Ordinances, the commissioner may require taxpayers to
file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this section,
including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
   (E)    Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section
shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the tax commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.
   (F)    When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the tax commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.  (Ord.
18-02.  Passed 1-17-18.)
   193.85  ELECTRONIC FILING.
   (A)    All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under section
193.80 of the Codified Ordinances shall file any tax return or extension for
filing a tax return, and shall make payment of amounts shown to be due on such
returns, electronically, either through the Ohio business gateway or in another
manner as prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)    A taxpayer may apply to the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the
commissioner, to be excused from the requirement to file returns and make
payments electronically. For good cause shown, the commissioner may excuse the
applicant from the requirement and permit the applicant to file the returns or
make the payments by nonelectronic means.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may adopt rules establishing the following:
      (1)    The format of documents to be used by taxpayers to file returns
and make payments by electronic means;
      (2)    The information taxpayers must submit when filing tax returns by
electronic means.  (Ord. 18-02.  Passed 1-17-18.)
   193.86  CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax commissioner. The tax
commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 193.80 of
the Codified Ordinances, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division
(B)(1) or (2) of section
193.063 of the Codified Ordinances is binding upon the tax commissioner for the
remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election made under section
193.80 of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
193.81 of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in
that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of section
193.81 of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
193.82 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
193.82 of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in section
193.82 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with sections
193.80 to
193.95 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits that
would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under section
193.82 of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from"
appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations"
for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under section
193.80 to
193.95 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
(Ord. 18-02.  Passed 1-17-18.)
   193.87  FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
193.80 of the Codified Ordinances fails to pay any tax as required under
sections
193.80 to
193.95 of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before the
date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under section
193.90 of the Codified Ordinances, whichever occurs first.  (Ord. 18-02. 
Passed 1-17-18.)
   193.88  DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under sections
193.80 to
193.95 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
         (Ord. 18-02.  Passed 1-17-18.)
   193.89  ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by sections
193.80 to
193.95 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code, the
following penalties shall apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under sections
193.80 to
193.95 of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax
commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the
date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under
this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
sections
193.80 to
193.95 of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a
penalty not to exceed the following:
         (a)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (b)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section
193.80 of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax required
to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to
fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
sections
193.80 to
193.95 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of sections
193.80 to
193.95 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may
be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under sections
193.80 to
193.95 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
section
193.91 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
section 193.90 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation
for the assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under sections
193.80 to
193.95 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 18-02.  Passed 1-17-18.)
   193.90  ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under section
193.80 to
193.95 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in section
193.91 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by sections
193.80 to
193.95 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by section
193.91 of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as provided by
that section.  (Ord. 18-02.  Passed 1-17-18.)
   193.91  REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under sections
193.80 to
193.95 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of section
193.90 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited. (Ord. 18-02.  Passed
1-17-18.)
   193.92  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under section
193.80 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
sections
193.80 to
193.95 of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under section
193.90 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
section
193.91 of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in section
193.91 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.
(Ord. 18-02.  Passed 1-17-18.)
   193.93 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to sections
193.80 to
193.95 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to sections
193.80 to
193.95 of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the tax commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to
comply.  (Ord. 18-02.  Passed 1-17-18.)

      (2)    Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the

      (3)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the City and taxpayer under section
193.21 of the Codified Ordinances,, or to modify the terms or conditions of any

charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable.  The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the

303.083  as amended are now codified in Section
303.081 .)
   303.09  LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY
WITHOUT PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two consecutive hours without the permission of the person having
the right to the possession of the property or on a public street or other
property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or
upon or within the right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight
consecutive hours or longer, without notification to the Police Chief of the
reasons for leaving the vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the
Municipality. 
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. 
(ORC 4513.64)
   303.10  LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the Chief of Police or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send
notice by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person having
the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is
left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle
either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable structure
or shall be removed from the property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section. 
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice.  Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.65)
   303.11  PROVIDING FALSE INFORMATION TO POLICE OFFICER.
   (a)   No person shall knowingly present, display or orally communicate a
false name, social security number or date of birth to a law enforcement
officer who is in the process of issuing to the person a traffic ticket or
complaint.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree.

specified, all of the following apply:
      (1)   “Distracted” means doing either of the following while operating a
vehicle:
         A.   Using a handheld electronic wireless communications device, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4511.204 except when utilizing any of the following:
            1.   The device’s speakerphone function;
            2.   A wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short

hand except to activate, deactivate, or initiate a feature or function;
            4.   Any device that is physically or electronically integrated
into the motor vehicle.
         B.   Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time.  A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section

      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a

the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00),
the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course,
the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio Director of
Public Safety.  If the offender attends and successfully completes the course,
the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course.  The offender shall be required to pay the total amount
of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender
submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and such written
evidence.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section.  If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

   313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,

intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.

flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;

intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that

         A.   The person obtained the controlled substance pursuant to a
prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
         B.   The person injected, ingested, or inhaled the controlled
substance in accordance with the health professional’s directions.
   (e)   Evidence; Tests. 
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood
under this subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasmabreath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains.  The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid

section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and

otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years.  The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. 
The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock
device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days.  The
court shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection
unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a

court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is

term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,

bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.

      (3)   An employer, school official or official affiliated with a
religious event is not liable in damages in a civil action for any injury,
death or loss to person or property that allegedly arises from, or is related
to, the fact that the employer, school official, or official affiliated with a
religious event provided the holder of a  probationary driver’s license with
the written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section.
The Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall make available at no cost a form to serve
as the written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section,

member occupying the vehicle unless the probationary license holder is
accompanied by the probationary license holder’s parent, guardian or custodian.
   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or

vehicle in violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. of this section; or the
holder was an emancipated minor.
   (c)   (1)   If a person is issued a probationary driver’s license prior to
attaining the age of seventeen years and the person pleads guilty to, is
convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving
violation during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the
person is issued the probationary driver’s license, the court with jurisdiction
over the violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle
upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking for a period not to exceed six months
or the date the holder attains the age of seventeen years, whichever occurs

under subsection (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for driving privileges without being accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection.  In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted.  If a person is convicted of,
pleads guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a
second or subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the
violation may terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this
division.
      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under
subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
   (d)   No holder of a probationary license shall operate a motor vehicle upon

vehicle is wearing all of the available elements of a properly adjusted
occupant restraining device.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or
is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for such a violation or for causing the arrest of or commencing a
prosecution of a person for such violation.

      (3)   “Moving violation” means any violation of any statute or ordinance
that regulates the operation of vehicles, streetcars, or trackless trolleys on
the highways or streets.  “Moving violation” does not include a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4513.263 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a
violation of any statute or ordinance regulating pedestrians or the parking of
vehicles, vehicle size or load limitations, vehicle fitness requirements, or

electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to either of the
following:

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct.  However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order.  The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved.  When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section.  The
person charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may

subject to inspection or copying under Ohio R.C. 149.43.
   (d)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on
any street or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (b) hereof has been or is being
committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or summons for
a violation of that nature or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution
of a person for a violation of that nature, and no law enforcement officer
shall view the interior or visually inspect any automobile being operated on
any street or highway for the sole purpose of determining whether a violation
of that nature has been or is being committed.

person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an automobile being
operated by that person is wearing all of the available elements of a properly
adjusted occupant restraining device, in violation of subsection (b)(2)  of
this section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort
action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.  But the trier of
fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of
evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action
and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic
loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.  Evidence of that failure

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.     It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the
occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)    The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
   501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. 
(ORC 2923.02)
   501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. 
(ORC 2901.24)
   501.13  CONSPIRACY.

commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,

unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.01)
   501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the

device or instrument form within a motor vehicle or at any other location so
that the sound is plainly audible at a distance of 100 feet or more from the
motor vehicle or other place where it is being generated.
   (b)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to any law enforcement

            (4)       In any type of aggressive manner.
   (d)   No person shall knowingly make any false or misleading representation
in the course of panhandling so that a reasonable person with normal
sensibilities would rely on that false or misleading representation to give the
individual the donation to remediate the false or misleading representation. 
False or misleading representations include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)     Stating, or implying, that the donation is needed to meet a

private property for the purpose of the directed individual giving the
panhandler a donation without the panhandler having the express consent of the
property owner to do so.

revoked shall panhandle for a period of two years following the revocation.
      (2)     The police department shall issue the permit, without fee, to any
eligible person who presents himself at the police station, states his true

more offenses under the law of any jurisdiction which involve aggressive or
intimidating behavior while panhandling or false or misleading representations
while panhandling.
      (4)     If the police department is unable to determine eligibility
within 24 hours of the application, the department shall issue a permit good
for 30 days and determine eligibility for a regular permit before the temporary
permit expires. The regular permit shall expire three years from the date of
issuance. Along with the permit, the police department shall give the applicant
a copy of this chapter.
      (5)     No person, in the process of applying for a permit, shall make
any false or misleading representation. 
      (6)     If a permit is issued to a person under this section and that
person subsequently commits and is convicted of a violation of any provision of
this chapter, the police department shall revoke the permit.
   (i)    Whoever violates any provision of this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree.  Each subsequent of violation of any section
of this Ordinance within a 1 year time frame shall be a misdemeanor of the next

secretary of the treasury of the United States for disposal or use for medical
or scientific purposes under applicable federal law.
      (2)   Firearms and dangerous ordnance suitable for police work may be
given to a law enforcement agency for that purpose.  Firearms suitable for

shall be sold by the department of liquor control, if the department determines
that the beer, intoxicating liquor, or alcohol is fit for sale.  If any tax
imposed under Ohio R.C. Title Forty-Three has not been paid in relation to the
beer, intoxicating liquor, or alcohol, the proceeds of the sale shall first be
used to pay the tax.  All other money collected under subsection (d)(4) hereof
of this section shall be paid into the state treasury.  Any such beer,
intoxicating liquor, or alcohol that the department determines to be unfit for
sale shall be destroyed.
      (5)   Money received by an inmate of a correctional institution from an
unauthorized source or in an unauthorized manner shall be returned to the
sender, if known, or deposited in the inmates' industrial and entertainment
fund if the sender is not known.

Parts that do not bear vehicle identification numbers or derivatives thereof
may be sold or disposed of as provided by rules of the director of highway
safety.  Parts from which a vehicle identification number or derivative thereof
has been removed, defaced, covered, altered, or destroyed and that are not
suitable for police work or incorporation into an official vehicle shall be
destroyed and sold as junk or scrap.
      (7)   Other unclaimed or forfeited property may be sold at public
auction, or disposed of in another manner that the court considers proper in
the circumstances.
   (e)   (1)   Except as provided in subsections (d)(4), (5), and (e)(2)
hereof, the proceeds from property disposed of pursuant to this section shall
be placed in the general fund of the state, the county, the township, or the
municipal corporation, of which the law enforcement agency involved is an
agency.

reward program as provided in Ohio R.C. 9.92 shall notify each law enforcement
agency of that county and each law enforcement agency of a township or
municipal corporation wholly located in that county of the official recognition
of the citizens' reward program by filing a copy of its resolution conferring
such recognition with each such law enforcement agency.  When the board of
county commissioners of a county recognizes a citizen's reward program and the
county includes a part but not all of the territory of a municipal corporation,
the board shall so notify the law enforcement agency of that munipal
corporation of the official recognition of the citizens' reward program only if
the county contains the highest percentage of the municipal corporation's
population.  Upon receipt of such notice each law enforcement agency shall pay
twenty-five percent (25%) of the proceeds from each sale of property disposed
of pursuant to this section to the citizens' reward program for use exclusively
for the payment of rewards.  No part of such funds may be used to pay for the
administrative expenses or any other expense associated with a reward program. 
If a citizens' reward program which operates in more than one county or in
another state or states in addition to Ohio receives funds pursuant to this
section, the funds shall be used to pay rewards only for tips and information
to law enforcement agencies concerning felonies, offenses of violence, or
misdemeanors that have been committed in the county from which the funds were
received.
   (f)   This section does not apply to the collection, storage, or disposal of
abandoned junk motor vehicles.  This section shall not be construed to rescind
or restrict the authority of a municipal law enforcement agency to keep and
dispose of lost, abandoned, stolen, seized, or forfeited property under an
ordinance of the municipal corporation, provided that when a municipal
corporation that has received notice as provided in subsection (e)(2) hereof
disposes of property under such an ordinance it shall pay twenty-five percent
(25%) of the proceeds from any sale or auction to the citizens' reward program
as provided under subsection (e)(2) of this section.
   (g)   The receipt of funds by a citizens' reward program pursuant to
subsection (e) hereof does not make it a governmental unit for purposes of Ohio
R.C. 149.43 and does not subject it to the disclosure provisions of that
section.
   (h)   For purposes of this section, "law enforcement agency" includes
correctional institutions.  As used in this section, "citizens' reward program"
has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 9.92.

   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another.  Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if
such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or
gratifying either person.

   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting

to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite;
      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which
inspires disgust or revulsion in persons with ordinary sensibilities, without
serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to

primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than
primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.

genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.

   535.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting this chapter, pursuant to Section 715.55 of the Ohio
Revised Code, the City of Ontario Council, hereinafter Council, makes the
following statement of intent and findings:
      (1)   Adult entertainment establishments require special supervision from
the public safety agencies of the City of Ontario in order to protect and
preserve the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the patrons and employees
of the businesses as well as the citizens of the City of Ontario.
      (2)   Council finds that adult entertainment establishments are
frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including prostitution and
sexual liaisons of a casual nature.
      (3)   The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate
health concern of Council that demands reasonable regulation of adult
entertainment establishments by Council in the specified manner, and expanded
authority for reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments by
local governments, in order to protect the health and well-being of the
citizens.
      (4)   Minimal regulations enacted by Council are a legitimate and
reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult
entertainment establishments comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure
that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places
of illegal sexual activity or solicitation.
      (5)   There is convincing documented evidence that adult entertainment
establishments, because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both
the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas
adjacent to them, cause increased crime, particularly in the overnight hours,
and downgrade property values.
      (6)   Council desires to minimize and control these adverse effects by
regulating adult entertainment establishments in the specified manner. And by
minimizing and controlling these adverse effects, Council seeks to protect the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry; protect the citizens from
increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and
character of surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the spread of urban blight.
      (7)   Council has determined that current local zoning and other
locational criteria do not adequately protect the health, safety, and general
welfare of the people of the City of Ontario and that expanded regulation of
adult entertainment establishments is necessary.
      (8)   It is not the intent of Council in enacting this act to suppress or
authorize the suppression of any speech activities protected by the First
Amendment, but to enact content-neutral statutes that address the secondary
effects of adult entertainment establishments.
      (9)   It is not the intent of Council to condone or legitimize the
distribution of obscene material, and Council recognizes that state and federal
law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and expects and encourages
state law enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes against any
such illegal activities in this State.
   (b)   It is the intent of Council in enacting this chapter to regulate in
the specified manner adult entertainment establishments in order to promote the
health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of
Ontario and establish reasonable regulations to prevent the deleterious
secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments within the City of
Ontario. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of
imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the
intent of Council in enacting this chapter to restrict or deny, or authorize
the restriction or denial of, access by adults to sexually oriented materials
protected by the First Amendment, or to deny, or authorize the denial of,
access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult entertainment and adult
materials to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of
Council in enacting this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution or
exhibition of obscene material.
   (c)   Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult
uses on communities presented in hearings and in reports made available to the
legislature and subsequently adopted by the Ohio General Assembly as findings

and on testimony to Congress in 136 Cong. Rec. S. 8987; 135 Cong. Rec. S.
14519; 135 Cong. Rec. S. 5636, 134 Cong. Rec. E. 3750; and also on findings
from the paper entitled "Stripclubs According to Strippers: Exposing Workplace
Sexual Violence," by Kelly Holsopple, Program Director, Freedom and Justice
Center for Prostitution Resources, Minneapolis, Minnesota; and from "Sexually
Oriented Businesses: An Insider's View," by David Sherman, presented to the
Michigan House Committee on Ethics and Constitutional Law, Jan. 12, 2000; and
from various other police reports, testimony, newspaper reports, and other
documentary evidence), and subsequent findings in Sensations, Inc. v. City of
Grand Rapids, Michigan Decency Action Council (6th Cir. 2008), 526 F.3d 291;
729, Inc. v. Kenton County Fiscal Court (6th Cir. 2008), 515 F.3d 485; and
Andy's Rest. & Lounge, Inc. v. City of Gary (7th Cir. 2006), 466 F.3d 550, and
Council's independent review of the same) Council finds:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are
often associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including,
but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential
spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, illicit drug use and drug
trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter,
and sexual assault and exploitation.
      (2)   Illegal and unsanitary acts involving nudity, including lewd
conduct, masturbation, oral and anal sex, occur at unregulated sexually
oriented businesses, including those businesses which provide private or semi-
private rooms, booths, or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live
performances.
      (3)   Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm
which the City of Ontario has a substantial government interest in preventing
and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary
effects, which is the City of Ontario's rationale for this chapter, exists
independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-
sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, Council's interest in regulating
sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of
either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the
City of Ontario. Council finds that the cases and documentation relied on in
this chapter are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.
      (4)   The enactment of this chapter will promote the general welfare,
health, morals, and safety of the citizens of the City of Ontario.

museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind

difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.

involved in the offense.

545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

   741.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting this chapter, pursuant to Section 715.55 of the Ohio
Revised Code, the Ontario City Council, hereinafter Council, makes the
following statement of intent and findings:
      (1)   Adult entertainment establishments require special supervision from
the public safety agencies of the City of Ontario in order to protect and
preserve the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the patrons and employees
of the businesses as well as the citizens of the City of Ontario.
      (2)   Council finds that adult entertainment establishments are
frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including prostitution and
sexual liaisons of a casual nature.
      (3)   The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate
health concern of Council that demands reasonable regulation of adult
entertainment establishments by Council in the specified manner, and expanded
authority for reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments by
local governments, in order to protect the health and well-being of the
citizens.
      (4)   Minimal regulations enacted by Council are a legitimate and
reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult
entertainment establishments comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure
that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places
of illegal sexual activity or solicitation.
      (5)   There is convincing documented evidence that adult entertainment
establishments, because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both
the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas
adjacent to them, cause increased crime, particularly in the overnight hours,
and downgrade property values.
      (6)   Council desires to minimize and control these adverse effects by
regulating adult entertainment establishments in the specified manner. And by
minimizing and controlling these adverse effects, Council seeks to protect the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry; protect the citizens from
increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and
character of surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the spread of urban blight.
      (7)   Council has determined that current local zoning and other
locational criteria do not adequately protect the health, safety, and general
welfare of the people of the City of Ontario and that expanded regulation of
adult entertainment establishments is necessary.
      (8)   It is not the intent of Council in enacting this act to suppress or
authorize the suppression of any speech activities protected by the First
Amendment, but to enact content-neutral statutes that address the secondary
effects of adult entertainment establishments.
      (9)   It is not the intent of Council to condone or legitimize the
distribution of obscene material, and Council recognizes that state and federal
law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and expects and encourages
state law enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes against any
such illegal activities in this State.
   (b)   It is the intent of Council in enacting this chapter to regulate in
the specified manner adult entertainment establishments in order to promote the
health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of
Ontario and establish reasonable regulations to prevent the deleterious
secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments within the City of
Ontario. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of
imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the
intent of Council in enacting this chapter to restrict or deny, or authorize
the restriction or denial of, access by adults to sexually oriented materials
protected by the First Amendment, or to deny, or authorize the denial of,
access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult entertainment and adult
materials to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of
Council in enacting this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution or
exhibition of obscene material.
   (c)   Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult
uses on communities presented in hearings and in reports made available to the
legislature and subsequently adopted by the Ohio General Assembly as findings
under Section 3 of House Bill 23 (and on findings incorporated in the cases of

Grand Rapids, Michigan Decency Action Council (6th Cir. 2008), 526 F.3d 291;
729, Inc. v. Kenton County Fiscal Court (6th Cir. 2008), 515 F.3d 485; and
Andy's Rest. & Lounge, Inc. v. City of Gary (7th Cir. 2006), 466 F.3d 550, and
Council's independent review of the same) Council finds:
      (1)   Adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the
operators of the establishments.
      (2)   Certain employees of adult entertainment establishments, as defined
in this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets, engage in a higher incidence of
certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other
establishments.
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at
adult entertainment establishments, especially those that provide private or
semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
The "couch dances" or "lap dances" that frequently occur in adult entertainment
establishments featuring live nude or seminude dancers constitute or may
constitute the offense of "engaging in prostitution" under Section 2907.25 of
the Ohio Revised Code.
      (4)   Offering and providing private or semi-private booths or cubicles
encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sexual
activity within the premises of those adult entertainment establishments.
      (6)   Numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis salmonella, campylobacter and shigella infections,
chlamydial, myoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections, trichomoniasis, and
chancroid.
      (7)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States: 600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983,
4,600 in 1984, 8,555 in 1985, and 253,448 through December 31, 1992.
      (8)   A total of 10,255 AIDS cases had been reported in Ohio as of
January 1999. Ohio has required HIV case reporting since 1990, and the reported
information shows 7,969 people living with (HIV) (4,213) and (AIDS) (3,756) in
the State.
      (9)   Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing
cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test in
Ohio.
      (10)   The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the
Unites States reported annually has risen. 33,613 cases were reported in 1982,
and 45,200 cases were reported through November 1990.
      (11)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases being
reported in 1990.
      (12)   The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October
22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, and exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
      (13)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
      (14)   Sanitary conditions in some adult entertainment establishments are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
      (15)   The findings noted in subsection (c)(1) to (14) hereof raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (16)   Adult entertainment establishments have operational
characteristics that require or mandate subject them to reasonable government
regulation in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
      (17)   The enactment of this chapter will promote the general welfare,
health, morals, and safety of the citizens of this City.

   (a)   In the event that Council denies, suspends, or revokes a new or
renewal license under this chapter, or any action taken on an appeal that is
provided by this chapter, the applicant may pursue an appeal to Richland County
Court of Common Pleas pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Chapter 2506. The failure
of Council to render a decision on the application within the time prescribed
in Section
741.09(a) shall be considered an affirmance of the denial, suspension, or
revocation of the license and the applicant may pursue an appeal to Richland
County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Chapter 2506. This
appeal provision is intended to comply with the requirement for prompt judicial
review stated by the United States Supreme Court in Township of Littleton,
Colorado v. Z. J. Gifts D-4 (2004), 541 U.S. 774.
   (b)   Any licensee lawfully operating a sexually oriented business prior to
the denial of a license renewal application, or the suspension or revocation of
a license, shall retain said license and all privileges attendant thereto,
subject to all other terms of this chapter, so that the status quo of the
licensee is maintained during the pendency of an appeal of a decision rendered
under this chapter and during the entire time required for the court to rule on
the appeal pursuant to subsection (a) above.
   (c)   Any licensee lawfully acting as an employee in a sexually oriented
business prior to the denial of a license renewal application, or the
suspension or revocation of a license, shall retain said license and all
privileges attendant thereto, subject to all other terms of this chapter, so
that the status quo of the licensee is maintained during the pendency of an
appeal of a decision rendered under this chapter and during the entire time
required for the court to rule on the appeal pursuant to subsection (a) above.
   (d)   In the event that any judicial review of the denial of a new or
renewal license application or the revocation or suspension of a license is
still pending thirty (30) days before the expiration date of any license, the
licensee may file a renewal license application with Council or its designee
pursuant to this chapter. In the event that an application for renewal of a
license is denied and the applicant seeks judicial review of that denial,
Council has the right to consolidate such review with any pending judicial
actions in regards to the previous denial, suspension or revocation of a
license.
   (e)   If, during the pendency of any appeal pursued under subsection (a)
above, there are additional denials of a renewal license application or
suspensions or revocations of that license, Council has the right to
consolidate the appeal pursued, subsection (a) above for the additional
denials, suspensions or revocations with any pending appeal for that same
licensee.
(Ord. 10-14.  Passed 4-1-10.)
   741.12  TRANSFER OF LICENSE.

but the use of the license by the individual to whom it was issued may be

licensed establishment during the term of the license, provided that the
licensee gives written notice of such transfer to Council or its designee
within fifteen (15) days of such transfer.

permit if it does not conduct, offer, or allow sexually oriented business
activity in which the performers appear nude.

(Ord. 07-07.  Passed 2-7-07.)
   913.02  PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY.
   (a)   Council recognizes that new growth and development in the City
requires that the capacity of the Municipal road system be expanded and that in
the absence of a funded program of roadway improvements, new growth and
development would have to be restricted in order to avoid undue congestion of
the roads of the City and to protect the health, safety and welfare of the
citizens of the City.
   (b)   The purpose of the chapter is to ensure that new growth and
development mitigates the impact of new growth and development on the quality
of life in the City of Ontario by paying a fair share of the costs of road
improvements needed to serve new growth and development thereby ensuring that
needed roads will be constructed.
   (c)   All fair share impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be
used for the construction of road improvements that benefit and serve new
growth and development.
   (d)   The City has the authority to implement a fair share road impact fee
program under the Ohio Constitution’s home rule provisions, Ohio Const. Art.
XVIII, and subdivision regulations, Ohio R.C. Ch. 711 et seq. 
(Ord. 07-07.  Passed 2-7-07.)

land use that will generate new or additional traffic in terms of average daily
trips, peak hour trips or longer trip lengths.
   (d)   “Encumbered” means legally obligated or otherwise committed to use by

Auditor, Service/Safety Director, and City Engineer.
   (h)   “Level of service”  is a measure of roadway capacity in terms of
traffic flow, in which operating speeds are assessed, and in which changes in
operating conditions, fluctuations in volume, and temporary restrictions to
flow are evaluated.
   (i)   “Level of Service D” is a measure of roadway capacity in terms of
traffic flow which describes a condition approaching unstable traffic flow. 
Tolerable operating speeds are maintained, although considerably affected by
changes in operating conditions.  Fluctuations in volume and temporary
restrictions to flow may cause substantial drops in operating speeds.  Drivers
have little freedom to maneuver, and comfort and convenience are low, but
conditions can be tolerated for short periods of time.  Level of Service D is
generally calculated as a volume to capacity ratio of eighty percent (80%).
   (j)   “Non-commencement” means the cancellation or abandonment of authorized
development and the expiration or forfeiture of development approval.
   (k)   “Off-site improvement” means roadway facilities that are planned and
designed to provide traffic service to the general public in contrast to “on-
site” improvements, which are necessary to provide safe and or efficient access
to a particular development.  The fact that either type of improvement may have
incidental benefits of special or general character shall not be considered in
determining which improvements are on or off-site.  The character of the
improvement shall control a determination of whether an improvement is on or
off-site, and the physical location of the improvement on or off-site shall not
be considered determinative.
   (l)   “Peak hour”  (PH) means the period from 7:00 and 9:00 a.m. and 4:00
and 6:00 p.m., Peak Hour Volume (PHV) is the hourly volume during the maximum
volume hour of the day.

expectation of passing over a given section of a lane or a roadway in one
direction, or in both directions for a two-lane, three-lane, or four-lane
highway, during a given time period under prevailing traffic conditions at an
identified level of service.
   (o)   “Road impact fee use district” means those areas designated as
improvement benefit districts in Section
913.11 in which collected fair share impact fees must be expended.

impact fee according to the terms and conditions of this chapter.
   (b)   The following development shall not be required to pay to the road
impact fee imposed by this chapter:
      (1)   Alterations or expansion of an existing dwelling unit where no
additional units are created and the use is not changed:
      (2)   The construction of accessory buildings or structures which are not
dwelling units and which do not constitute an increase in intensity of use
under the Zoning Ordinance and do not generate additional traffic;
      (3)   The replacement of a destroyed or partially destroyed building or
structure, with a new building or structure of the same size and use;
      (4)   Publicly owned governmental buildings, except for those used for
permanent or temporary housing; and

additional traffic generated by the development has an insignificant impact on
the level of service of the street and traffic control systems.
         (Ord. 07-07.  Passed 2-7-07.)
   913.06  SITE IMPACT ANALYSIS.
   Any proposed development shall be required to provide the City a site
traffic impact analysis unless waived by the City Engineer.  For those
developments required to pay an impact fee, the analysis will be used to help
determine the amount of the fee.  The analysis shall include but not be limited
to:
   (a)   Trip generation rates for the development in terms of ADT and PHV
based on empirical surveys for similar land uses and/or data presented by the
Institute of Transportation Engineers, “Trip Generation” latest edition.

   913.10  INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT OF ROAD IMPACTS.
   (a)   Any person who initiates development which is required to pay a Road
Impact Fee who believes that the actual traffic generation from a proposed
project will be less than the projected traffic on which the fee schedule was
based, may apply for a determination of an individual road impact fee
assessment for the proposed development.  The individual road impact fee
assessment shall be based on a certified traffic study supplied by developer
and/or data presented by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, “Trip
Generation” latest edition.
   (b)   Within fifteen working days of receipt of an application for an
individual road impact fee assessment, the City Engineer shall determine if the
application is complete.  If the City Engineer determines the application is
not complete, he or she shall send a written statement specifying the
deficiencies by mail to the person submitting the application.  Until the
deficiencies are corrected, the City Engineer shall take no further action on
the application.
   (c)   When the City Engineer determines the application for an individual
road impact fee assessment is complete, he or she shall, within fifteen working
days, review the application, and if the City Engineer determines that the
traffic information, traffic factors, and methodology support an individual
road impact fee assessment that is acceptable and fairly assesses the fair
share of cost of road improvements needed to serve the proposed development, he
or she shall issue a determination of individual road impact fee assessment. 
If the City Engineer determines the traffic information, traffic factors, or
methodology are not appropriate, the application for individual road impact fee
assessment shall be denied, and the developer shall pay the fair share road
impact fee according to the schedule established in Sections
913.09 and
913.10.
(Ord. 07-07.  Passed 2-7-07.)
   913.11  CREDITS.
   (a)   Any person who initiates any development may apply for a credit
against the fair share road impact fee imposed by this chapter for any
contribution, payment, construction, or dedication of land accepted and
received by the City of Ontario for capital roadway improvements within the
same Road Impact Fee Use District as the proposed development.  No credit shall
exceed the road impact fee imposed by this chapter for the proposed
development.
   (b)   An applicant shall be entitled to a credit equal to the dollar value
of the cost of off- site improvements previously contributed, paid for or
legally obligated to by the applicant or his or her predecessor in interest. 
The cost of such improvements shall be based on the following criteria:
      (1)   The actual cost, or estimated cost of improvements based on recent
bid sheet information of the City of Ontario, and
      (2)   A qualified appraisal of the fair market value of any  donated land
required for the improvement at the date the road impact fee is payable.
   (c)   The property owner may apply for a determination of entitlement to
credit by submitting an application for a determination of credit to the City
Engineer.  The application shall include the following:
      (1)   A proposed plan of specific road improvements, prepared and
certified by a duly qualified and licensed Ohio engineer; and
      (2)   The projected costs for the suggested roadway improvements, which
shall be based on local information for similar transportation improvements,
along with the construction timetable for the completion of such improvements. 
Such estimated costs shall include the cost of all labor and materials, the
cost of all lands, property, rights, easements and franchises acquired,
financing charges, interest prior to and during construction and for one year
after completion of construction, cost of plans and specifications, surveys of
estimated costs and of revenues, costs of engineering and legal services, and
all other expenses necessary or incident to determining the feasibility or
practicability of such construction or reconstruction.
   (d)   Within fifteen working days of receipt of an application for a
determination of credit, the City Engineer shall determine if the proposal is
complete. If it is determined that the proposed Credit Agreement is not
complete, the City Engineer shall send a written statement to the applicant
outlining the deficiencies. The City Engineer shall take no further action on
the proposed Credit Agreement until all deficiencies have been corrected.
   (e)   Once the  City Engineer determines the Credit Agreement is complete he
or she shall, within fifteen working days, review the application and shall
approve the proposed Credit Agreement if it is determined that the proposed
capital roadway improvement is consistent with the capital improvements in the
Comprehensive Plan for the Municipal road system and the proposed costs for the
suggested roadway improvement are professionally acceptable and fairly assess
the cost for the capital improvement.
   (f)   Any person may appeal the City Engineer’s decision on any Credit
Agreement he or she submits by filing a petition with the Impact Fee Review
Board within ten days of a decision by the City Engineer.

water service shall connect to the City water supply system, when available.
   (b)   Council may by motion waive the requirements of this section where it

or business on the same property for which the excess payment was made, up to
but not to exceed the sum of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00).
   (c)   The permit and the fee specified herein shall be in addition to any
permit required by any other ordinance of the City and shall not preclude any
deposit or bond required by any other ordinance to insure that the connection
with the water lines shall be made in such a manner as will not injure the
water lines of the City and will insure that all streets, sidewalks and other
property will be returned to the same state as before the connection was made.
   (d)   Any person who attempts to or does connect property to a water line as
defined herein or a connection with such line, without securing the permit

   (3)   The possible future need for other property owners to tap into the
line;
      (4)   The possibility that the line may need to be extended in the future
to serve other properties.
      (5)   The need that the line, including any appurtenances thereto, may
require maintenance which can be more readily provided by the City.

with flexible elastomerically gasketed joints conforming to ASTM D-3212 push-on
type, or cast iron soil pipe ASTM Designation A74, joints or an approved no-
bell stainless steel band type joint.  House sewers shall be not less than six
inches in diameter.  If installed in filled or unstable ground, the building
sewer shall be of cast iron soil pipe, except that vitrified clay sewer pipe
material may be used if laid on a suitable concrete bed or cradle as approved
by the Service-Safety Director.
(Ord. 84-40.  Passed 10-4-84.)
   (i)   The size and slope of the building sewer shall be subject to the
approval of the Service-Safety Director, but in no event shall the diameter be
less than six inches.  The slope of such six inch pipe shall not be less than
one-eighth (l/8) inch per foot.
   (j)   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building
at an elevation below the basement floor.  No building sewer shall be laid
parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby be
weakened.  The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost.  The
building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight alignment insofar
as possible.  Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curbed pipe
and fittings.
   (k)   In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit
gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain shall
be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building sewer.
   (l)   All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer
shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the Service-Safety
Director.  Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM
Designation (C12) except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has
been inspected.
   (m)   Pipe shall be laid on six inches of crushed stone bedding material
conforming under ASTM #67 crushed aggregate.  It shall be a blend of angular
materials in the general size range of 1/4 inch to 3/4 inch.  It shall conform
to the following sieve analysis:  100% passing one inch; 90-100% passing 3/
4 inch; 20-55% passing 3/8 inch; 0-10% passing #4; 0-5% passing #8. 
Measurement shall be by weight.
   After the bedding material is placed in the bottom of the trench, the pipe
shall be laid in the bedding material with care being taken to insure that the
bottom of the pipe is resting on the bedding material for its full length.  The
pipe shall then be adjusted to the proper elevation by adding or removing
bedding material as required.
   No backfilling over completed work shall be done without the permission of
the Service-Safety Director.
   After the piping installation is approved by the Director, it shall be
backfilled to a depth of at least six inches above the top of the pipe with
granular material conforming to that specified for bedding material.  This
initial backfill shall be thoroughly tamped to the satisfaction of the Director
with precaution taken so that no misalignment and no change in grade will occur
during the backfilling operation.
   The balance of the trench located outside of pavement limits shall be
backfilled with the excavated materials free of large stones or lumps.  All
excavations within the limits of street pavement, parking areas or public
drives shall be backfilled with gravel backfill compacted in place.  Gravel
backfill shall meet with the approval of the Director prior to its
installation.  All excavations shall be adequately guarded with barricades and
lights so as to protect the public from hazard.
(Ord. 80-24.  Passed 3-20-80.)
   (n)   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be
made at a wye or tee fitting, if such fitting is available at a suitable
location.  If the public sewer is fifteen inches in diameter or less, and no
properly located wye or tee fitting is available, the owner shall at his
expense install a wye or tee fitting in the public sewer at the location
specified by the Service-Safety Director.  This shall be done by neatly sawing
pipe and removing same, and inserting new wye or tee fitting and required pipe
and connecting with stainless steel "no-hub" connectors in accordance with
standard drawings available at the Director's office.  Wye or tee fitting
material shall be clay pipe (ASTM C-700) with compression type gaskets (ASTM C-
425) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe (ASTM D-3034, SDR 35) with flexible
elastomerically gasketed joints (ASTM d-3212, push-on type).  Where the public
sewer is greater than fifteen inches in diameter, and a wye or tee fitting is
not available, connection into the public sewer shall be made by using a saddle
completely in concrete and made water tight.  Long radius forty-five degrees
bends shall be used, as required, at the wye or tee fitting.
(Ord. 92-51.  Passed 9-3-92.)
   (o)   The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the Service-
Safety Director when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection
to the public sewer.  The connection shall be made under the supervision of the
Director or his representative.
   (p)   All excavations for building sewer installations shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. 
Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course
of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the Service-Safety
Director.
   (q)   In those instances where the proper City sanitary sewer lines are
located within the public right of way of a City street, but on the opposite
side of the paved portion of the street, it shall be Ontario's responsibility
to bring a sanitary sewer service line to the property owner's side of the
paved surface.  The City shall construct such sanitary sewer crossovers for all
existing structures or for any anticipated structures provided proper zoning
and sewer permits have been secured by the property owner.
   Such crossover sanitary sewer lines shall be extended beyond the paved
portion of the public right of way as may be necessary to protect the existing
pavement or existing utilities but not beyond any proper private property line.
(Ord. 80-24.  Passed 3-20-80.)
   925.06  LICENSED SEWER TAPPERS.
   (a)   No person shall engage in the business of making connections with the
City sewers or drains or lateral connections, or making repairs thereto within
the City unless he shall have been duly licensed to engage in such business by
the Service-Safety Director.  Such license shall not be issued until the
applicant shall have paid a license fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) for the
initial year and twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for each consecutive year
thereafter, and shall have filed with the Director evidence of the following:

requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.  Each industry shall
file a copy of the approved plans for pretreatment or equalization with the
Director.
(Ord. 80-24.  Passed 3-20-80.)
   925.11  OPERATION OF PRETREATMENT FACILITIES.
   Where pretreatment of flow-equalizing facilities are provided or required
for any sewage, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and
effective operation by the owner at his expense.
(Ord. 80-24.  Passed 3-20-80.)
   925.12  SPECIAL CONDITIONS.
   No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the City and any industrial concern
whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by
the City for treatment, subject to possible payment therefore by the industrial
concern for subsequent treatment.  Any industrial concern may appeal any
determination made by the Service-Safety Director in the enforcement of this
chapter as applicable under law. 
(Ord. 80-24.  Passed 3-20-80.)
   925.13  DETERMINATION OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE.
   (a)   The Service-Safety Director will prepare a questionnaire which will
determine the nature of industrial wastes to be expected from industrial
users.  These questionnaires will request information relative to types of
processes resulting in industrial waste.  Within thirty days of receipt of the
questionnaire, the industrial user will return the completed questionnaire.
   (b)   Submission of Detailed Data.  Upon receipt of complete questionnaires,
the Director will determine which industries are required to submit detailed
data.  This detailed data will define the nature and quantity of industrial
waste being discharged.  Within thirty days of receipt of the detailed data,
the City will issue a "permit to discharge."  This permit to discharge will
state maximum quantities of pollutants to be discharged by each industry. 
These quantities will be established by the Director from information supplied
in the "detailed data."
   (c)   Compliance Time Schedule.  Within thirty days of receipt of a "permit
to discharge," the affected industry will submit a compliance time table
showing milestones in which action will be taken before and no later than June
1, 1982.  This compliance time table shall include, but not be limited to, the
following milestones:
      (1)   Preliminary engineering to determine source of pollutants.
      (2)   Engineering evaluation and design of control method.
      (3)   Ordering equipment and lead time for purchased parts.
      (4)   Begin construction.
      (5)   Complete construction.
      (6)   Debug test.
   Upon submission of compliance time table, the Service-Safety Director will
accept or modify it in agreement with the affected industry.
   (d)   Permit Limitations for Certain Toxic Pollutants.  In preparing
industrial "permits to discharge" the Director shall ensure that the total
quantities of certain pollutants, as received at the sewage treatment plant,
will not exceed the following:
   total cyanide   -      2.0#/day
   total chromium   -   11.0#/day
   copper   -         10.3#/day
   zinc            33.1#/day
   cadmium   -      0.8#/day
   nickel   -         27.5#/day

   lead   -         2.9#/day
   mercury   -      0.05#/day
   silver   -         3.0#/day
   The great majority of users of the sewer system will produce negligible
quantities of the above pollutants.  Certain industries, however, may produce
significant quantities of certain pollutants in excess of the limitations
listed in
925.09(g).  The Director shall consider those industries as a group and shall
determine the quantities of pollutants which may be discharged by each.  In no
case shall the discharge from this group or any individual within this group
exceed the following concentration limitations or a mass unit limitation as
allocated in a permit to discharge:
            30 day average, mg/l
                  Concentration
   total cyanide         1.1
   total chromium      1.7
   copper            2.0
   zinc            4.7
   cadmium         0.5
   nickel            3.8
   phenols         0.2
   lead            0.4
   mercury         0.01
   silver            0.2
   The Director shall determine what quantities may be anticipated from all
other users and shall allocate the remainder of the waste loads among the
subject industries.
   If any industry, new or existing, desires to start a new process which will
cause the discharge of significant quantities of the above listed pollutants in
excess of levels that are allowed under their permit to discharge, this will be
permitted only if a corresponding decrease can be achieved among other
discharges.
   (e)   Control Manholes.  Each person discharging industrial wastes into a
public sewer shall construct and maintain one or more control manholes or
access points to facilitate observation, measurement and sampling of his
wastes, including sanitary sewage.
   Control manholes or access facilities shall be located and built in a manner
acceptable to the Director.  If measuring devices are to be permanently
installed they shall be a type acceptable to the Director.
   Control manholes, access facilities and related equipment shall be installed
by the person discharging the waste at his expense, and shall be maintained by
him so as to be in safe condition, accessible and in proper operating condition
at all times.  Plans for the installation of such facilities shall be approved
by the Director prior to the beginning of construction.
   (f)   Wastewater Volume Determination.  The volume of flow used for
computing sanitary sewer charges shall be the water usage of the person as
shown in the records of the Ontario Sewer and Water Collection office, except
as herein provided in this section.
   Any person discharging wastes into the public sewers, not utilizing City
water, shall install and maintain at his expense metering devices for
determining the volume of water usage, as a means of determining the volume of
waste being discharged to the public sewer.  The measuring devices shall be of
a type acceptable to the Director.
   A customer may, with Municipal approval, install a waste measuring device or
deduct meter rather than basing waste flows on water meter readings.  A
complete description of the metering facilities must be submitted to, and
approved by, the Director prior to installation.
   The Director may require the installation of waste measuring devices for
determining the volume of waste discharged, if for any reason it is necessary.
   Any metering device for determining the volume of waste discharged to the
public sewer shall be installed, owned and maintained by the person.  Following
approval and installation, such meters shall not be removed without the consent
of the Director.
   (g)   Sampling and Monitoring.  Industrial wastes discharged into the public
sewers shall be subject to periodic inspection with a determination of
character and concentration of said wastes.  The determination shall be made as
often as may be deemed necessary by the Service-Safety Director.
   If pollutant concentration in the discharge is of such varying nature, or if
the likelihood of a slug of a pollutant is so great, that a grab sample of the
wastewater cannot be relied upon to furnish a representative analysis of the
industry's discharge, then the Director may require the installation of special
sampling devices.  These may include a continuous sampling pump coupled to a
flow meter in such a way that the size of the sample is proportional to the
total flow.
   The owner shall be responsible for the collection and testing of the
aforementioned samples.  Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be
representative of the composition of the wastes.
   Access to sampling locations shall be granted to the Director or his
authorized representative at all times.  Every care shall be exercised in the
collection of samples to insure their preservation in a state comparable to
that at the time the sample was taken.
   (h)   Analyses.  Laboratory procedures used in the examination of industrial
wastes shall be those set forth in the latest edition of one of the following:
      (1)   Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater.
      (2)   Part 31 of the Standards of the American Society for Testing and
Materials.
      (3)   Method for Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes Environmental
Protection Agency.
   Alternative methods for certain analyses of industrial wastes may be used to
subject to mutual agreement between the Service-Safety Director and the person.
   Determination of the character and concentration of the industrial wastes
shall be made by the person responsible for the discharge, or his qualified
agent as approved by the Director.  The results of the analyses, shall be
reported to the City on forms provided by the City.  The City shall make its
own analyses of the wastes and these determinations shall be binding as a basis
for charges except under circumstances in the following paragraph.
   In case the analyses performed by the industry and the City result in
substantially different values, an effort shall be made by the industry to
collect samples at the same time the City collects its own samples.  The
results of the analyses of the samples collected by the City and the industry
shall be compared using the same testing procedures as outlined in the above
references and the differences negotiated. 
(Ord. 80-24.  Passed 3-20-80.)
   925.14  PROTECTION FROM DAMAGE.
   No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully, or negligently break,

they will receive all grease bearing kitchen waste except those from garbage
disposals.  Grease interceptors shall be installed immediately outside the
building where there is easy access for cleaning, unless it is impractical, in
which case they may be installed adjacent to and outside of the food
preparation area.  Any grease interceptor shall be installed in an open and
accessible place from permanent or temporary obstructions over and around the
interceptor with adequate head room to permit the ready inspection and complete
removal of the contents.
      (2)   The grease interceptor shall be inspected frequently and cleaned as
often as necessary to retain the grease wastes.  The materials removed in
cleaning shall be removed from the premises for disposal and not be deposited
in the plumbing system or sewage system.  The use of enzymes for the cleaning
of grease interceptors is not permitted.
      (3)   Prebuilt interceptors eight feet in length or longer shall be
equipped with openings at least twenty inches square or twenty-four inches in
diameter and located over the inlet and outlet baffles. Sizing shall conform to
“U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Design Manual for Onsite Wastewater

(Ord. 82-10.  Passed 3-4-82.)
   929.04  VOLUME OF SEWAGE.
   (a)   As described in subsequent sections of this chapter, certain segments
of the sanitary sewer charges are determined by applying a unit charge to a
volume of sewage flow from each user.  In all cases, this volume to be charged
for shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the volume that is recorded on the
meters used to measure water from the water system of the City, unless the user
is supplied with water from a source other than the water system of the City or
unless a substantial volume of water supplied to the user is not discharged to
the sewage treatment works, in which cases, the volume of water discharged to
the sewage treatment works shall be determined by one or more meters installed
to measure water flow and/or sewer discharged, or by other means approved by
the City.  In the event a sewage user is supplied either in whole or in part
with water from wells or any source other than the Ontario Water Department,
then such wells or other source of supply shall be registered with the Service-
Safety Director.  In the event a sewage user should elect at his own cost and
expense to install a separate water meter or meters for reregistering or
auxiliary meter for water cooled air conditioners, lawn sprinklers or other
uses which do not return flows to the sewage treatment works, the volume to be
charged for shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the metered water actually
used and returned to the sewer system, and the rates established in the
subsequent sections of this chapter shall apply.  In the event a sewer user
shall elect at his own cost and expense to install a meter to register the
exact volume of sewage that enters the sewage treatment works, the volume to be
charged for such metered sewage shall be based upon one hundred percent (100%)
of the actual meter reading and the rates established in subsequent sections of
this chapter shall apply.  Meters installed other than the meter or meters used
to record consumption from the water system of the City shall be approved by
the City and installed and maintained at the expense of the user.
   (b)   Sewer meters shall be tested for accuracy at the expense of the owner
once each year.
   (c)   The City shall have the authority to remove the meter on its
initiative to undertake to test and correct any meter which in its judgment is
registering incorrectly without the consent of the owner.  Should the sewage
meter be found to be registering outside of the accuracy of the specifications
published for such meter, the owner shall bear the cost for shipping, testing,
repair and replacement.  Should the sewage meter be found to be registering
within the accuracy of the specifications published for such meter, the City
shall bear the cost for shipping, testing, repair and replacement.  During the
period the meter is not in service, the volume of sewage discharged shall be
determined by the Service-Safety Director.
(Ord. 82-10.  Passed 3-4-82.)
   929.05  USER CLASSES.
   (a)   For the purpose of applying sanitary sewer charges, i.e. user charges
and debt service charges, all users of the sewage treatment works shall be
classified as a member of one of the following two user classes:
      (1)   Nonindustrial
      (2)   Industrial
   (b)   An industry may be placed in the nonindustrial user class if the
industry discharges segregated domestic wastes or wastes from sanitary
conveniences.
   (c)   Any industry whose wastes are not domestic wastes or not wastes from
sanitary conveniences shall be placed in the industrial user class.
   (d)   The placement of a user within the nonindustrial user class shall be
as determined by the Service-Safety Director in accordance with the above
criteria.
(Ord. 82-10.  Passed 3-4-82.)
   929.06  USER CHARGES - WASTES OF NORMAL CONCENTRATION.
   A user charge shall be levied on all users of the sewage treatment works to
provide funds necessary to pay for the cost of operation, maintenance and
replacement of such works.  The user charges must result in the distribution of
all costs of operation, maintenance and replacement of the treatment works to
each user, or user class, in proportion to such users contribution to the total
sewage loading of the treatment works.  Factors such as strength, volume and
delivery flow rate characteristics shall be considered and included as the
basis for the user's contribution to ensure a proportional distribution of
operation, maintenance and replacement costs.  The method to be used to
establish the base user charges for sewage within the limits of normal
concentrations is defined in Section
929.02.
(Ord. 82-10.  Passed 3-4-82.)
   929.07  EXTRA STRENGTH SURCHARGES.
   In addition to the rates provided above, extra strength users shall be
subject to the extra strength surcharge as follows:
   BOD   -      $ .080/lb. BOD
   Suspended solids   -.047/lb. SS
   Ammonia   -   .256/lb. NH3
(Ord. 82-10.  Passed 3-4-82.)
   929.08  INDUSTRIAL MONITORING CHARGES.
   An industrial monitoring charge shall be levied on certain industrial users
of the sewage treatment works to provide funds to meet municipal pretreatment
program expenditures required pursuant to 40 CFR Part 35.907 of the Federal
Regulations.  Industrial users shall be subject to an industrial monitoring
charge per composite or grab sample collected for analysis in an amount equal
to that established by the City of Mansfield.
(Ord. 82-10.  Passed 3-4-82.)
   929.09  RATES - FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS/CHURCHES/RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS AND
COMMERCIAL/INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS.
Upon the passage and implementation of this section the sewer rates shown below
shall be increased by three percent (3%) and increased three percent (3%)
annually every April 1st thereafter.

   933.04  LIMITATIONS ON WASTEWATER STRENGTH.
   (a)   National Categorical Pretreatment Standards.  National categorical
pretreatment standards as promulgated by the U.S. environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) pursuant to the Act shall be met by all dischargers.  An
application for modification of the national categorical pretreatment standards
may be considered for submittal to the Regional Administrator by the City, when
the City of Mansfield's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal
of the pollutants as defined by 40 CFR 403.7.
   (b)   State Requirements.  State requirements and limitations on discharges
to the POTW shall be met by all dischargers which are subject to such standards
in any instance in which they are more stringent than Federal requirements and
limitations as those in this chapter or any other applicable ordinance.
   (c)   Right of Revision.  The City reserves the right to amend this chapter
to provide for more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the
POTW where deemed necessary to comply with the objectives of the City of
Mansfield.
   (d)   Dilution.  No discharger shall increase the use of potable or process
water in any way for the purpose of diluting a discharge as a partial or
complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the
standards set forth in this chapter.  This shall not prohibit the use of
equalization tanks utilized to regulate flows.
   (e)   Supplementary Limitiations.  No discharger shall discharge wastewater
containing concentrations of the following enumerated materials, exceeding the
following values:
   Material   Concentration (mg/1)
   arsenic         ---*

   (Ord. 84-6.  Passed 2-2-84.)
   933.05  ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES.
   Each discharger shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited or regulated materials or substances established by this chapter. 
When there is a substantial danger to the public health or welfare or a
substantial danger to the environment or of interference to the POTW that would
result from an accidental discharge, facilities to prevent accidental discharge
of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the discharger's
cost and expense.  Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures
to provide this protection shall be submitted to the City to review, and shall
be approved by the City before construction of the facility.  Construction of
the approved facilities shall be completed within six months of notice to
provide protection.  If facilities are not completed within six months, the
City may deny permission to discharge to the sewer system.  Review and approval
of such plans and operating procedures by the City shall not relieve the
discharger from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet
the requirements of this chapter.  Dischargers shall notify the City
immediately upon the occurrence of a "slugload" or accidental discharge of
substances prohibited by this chapter.  The notification shall include location
of discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume,
and corrective actions.  Any discharger who discharges slugs or accidental
discharge of prohibited materials shall be liable for any expense, loss or
damage to the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the City
on account thereof under State and Federal law.  Signs shall be permanently
posted in conspicuous places on the discharger's premises, advising employees
whom to call in the event of a slug or accidental discharge.  Employers shall
instruct all employees, who may cause or discover such a discharge, with
respect to emergency notification procedure.
(Ord. 84-6.  Passed 2-2-84.)
   933.06  WASTEWATER DISCHARGERS.
   No person shall discharge sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes to any
sewer outlet within the jurisdiction of the City without having first complied
with the terms of this chapter.
   (a)   Wastewater Discharge Data Disclosure.
      (1)   General disclosure.  All industrial dischargers proposing to
connect to or discharge sewage, industrial wastes and other wastes to the POTW
shall comply with all terms of this chapter.
      (2)   Disclosure forms.  Industrial dischargers shall complete and file
with the City, a disclosure declaration in the form prescibed by the City of
Mansfield.  Existing industrial dischargers shall file disclosure forms within
thirty days after the effective date of this chapter, and each year
thereafter.  Proposed new dischargers shall file their disclosure forms at
least ninety days prior to connecting to the POTW.  The disclosure to be made
by the discharger shall be made on written forms provided by the City.  The
City shall evaluate the complete disclosure form and data furnished by the
discharger and may require additional information.  Within thirty days after
full evaluation and acceptance of the data furnished, the City shall notify the
discharger of the City's acceptance or non-acceptance thereof.
            An approved disclosure form is necessary to meet the requirements
of this chapter.  When the disclosure form indicates a need for additional
pretreatment the City may require additional pretreatment of discharged sewage,
industrial waste or other waste.  Thereafter following discovery in discharge
of a hitherto unknown pollutant which may exceed limits of this chapter, the
discharger shall file in thirty days with the City a method of disclosing the
source and quantity of the pollutant.  A time schedule of activities which will
produce the required information shall be submitted at the same time for review
and concurrence by the City.
      (3)   Additional pretreatment.  Where additional pretreatment and/or O
and M activities will be required to comply with this chapter, the discharger
shall provide a declaration of the shortest schedule by which the discharger
will provide such additional pretreatment and/or implementation of additional
operational and maintenance activities.  The discharger's declaration shall be
known as the compliance schedule and shall be subject to the following
requirements:
         A.   The schedule shall contain milestone dates for the commencement
and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of
additional pretreatment required for the discharger to comply with the
requirements of this chapter including, but not limited to dates relating to
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans,
executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing
construction, and all other acts to achieve compliance with this chapter.
         B.   Under no circumstances shall the City permit a time increment for
any single step directed toward compliance which exceeds three months.
         C.   Not later than fourteen days following each milestone date in the
schedule and the final date for compliance, the discharger shall submit a
progress report to the City including no less than a statement as to whether or
not it complied with the increment of progress represented by that milestone
date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of
progress the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the discharger to
return the construction to the approved schedule.  In no event shall more than
nine months elapse between such progress reports to the City.
         The City will evaluate the compliance schedule furnished by the
discharger and may require additional information.  Within thirty days after
full evaluation of the compliance schedule, the City shall notify the
discharger of the City's acceptance or nonacceptance thereof.
      (4)   Standards modification.  The City reserves the right to amend this
chapter and the terms and conditions hereof in order to assure compliance by
the City with applicable laws and regulations.  Within nine months of the
promulgation of a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard or State Standards
on discharges to the POTW, this chapter shall be amended to require compliance
by dischargers with such standards within the time frame prescribed by such
standards.  All National categorical Pretreatment Standards and all State
Discharge Standards adopted after the promulgation of this chapter shall be
adopted by the City.  Where a discharger subject to a National Categorical
Pretreatment Standard or State Discharge Standards has not previously submitted
a disclosure form as required by subsection (a)(2) hereof, the discharger shall
file a disclosure form with the City within 180 days after the promulgation of
the applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standard by the U.S. EPA or
State Discharge Standard.  In addition, any discharger operating on the basis
of a previous filing of a disclosure statement, shall submit to the City within
180 days after the promulgation of an applicable National Categorical
Pretreatment Standard or State Discharge Standard, any additional information
required by the City.  The discharger shall be informed of any proposed changes
in this chapter at least thirty days prior to the effective date of change. 
Any changes or new conditions in this chapter shall include a reasonable time
schedule for compliance.  The limitations set on toxic pollutants shall be
evaluated by the dischargers of the toxic pollutants discharged and the City
when one of the following conditions exists:
         A.   One year after implementation of this chapter and every year
thereafter.
         B.   Any time the effluent from the sewage treatment plant
consistently is above or below the water quality standards or effluent limits
established by the Ohio EPA.
   (b)   Reporting Requirements for Discharger.
      (1)   Compliance date report.  Within thirty days following the date for
final compliance by the discharger with applicable pretreatment standards set
forth in this chapter or thirty days following commencement of the introduction
of wastewater into the POTW by a new discharger, any discharger subject to this
chapter shall submit to the City a report indicating the nature and
concentration of all prohibited or regulated substances contained in it
discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons.  The report shall
state whether the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being
met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O and M and/or
pretreatment is necessary to bring the discharger into compliance with the
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements.  This statement shall be
signed by an authorized representative of the discharger.
      (2)   Periodic compliance reports.
         A.   Any discharger subject to a pretreatment standard set forth in
this chapter, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in
the case of a new discharger, after commencement of the discharge into the
sewer system, shall submit to the City during the months of June and December,
unless required more frequently by the City, a report indicating for three
consecutive days the nature and concentration of prohibited or regulated
substances in the effluent which are limited by the pretreatment standards
hereof.  In addition, this report shall include a record of all measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows during the reporting period.  Flows
shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided, however, where
cost or feasibillity considerations justify, the City may accept reports of
average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques.  The City, for
good cause shown, considering such factors as local high or low flow rates,
holidays, budget cycles, or other extenuating factors, may authorize the
submission of such reports on months other than those specified above.  Should
a report of any daily composite sampling show a violation of the maximum dialy
limit, the discharger will be required to report fourteen consecutive calendar
days of sampling performed for the pollutant in violation.  This sampling must
be completed within thirty calendar days of notification of the violation.  If
the results of the sampling show violation does occur, then the discharger will
be notified that a new compliance schedule is required.
            If the sampling indicates no additional violations, then no further
action will be required by the discharger at that time.
            Where categorical standards allow for a four-day average limit and
the report of scheduled sampling show the discharge exceeded the four-day
average, but within the maximum daily limit, the City will perform a second
sampling for the parameter of concern.  If the second sampling again indicates
the discharge is in excess of the four-day average, the discharger will be
notified and will be required to report seven days of sampling for that
parameter to show the pollutant does not exceed allowable limits.
         B.   Reports of dischargers shall contain all results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge, including the flow and nature and concentration, or
production and mass where required by the City.  The frequency of monitoring by
the discharger shall be prescribed in the applicable National Categorical
Pretreatment Standard or at intervals d etermined to be necessary by the  City
.  If pollutant concentration in the discharge is of such varying nature, or if
there is a reasonable risk of a slug of a pollutant that a grab sample of the
wastewater cannot be relied upon to furnish a representative analysis of the
industry's discharge, then the  City  may require the installation of special
sampling devices.  These may include a continuous sampling pump coupled to a
flow meter in such a way that the size of the sample is proportional to the
total flow.  The discharger shall be repsonsible for the collection and testing
of the aforementioned samples,  Samples shall be collected in such a manner as
to be representative of the composition of the wastes.  Every care shall be
exercised in the collection of samples to ensure their preservation in a state
comparable to that at the time the sample was taken.
            Analyses.  Laboratory procedures used in the examination of
industrial wastes shall be those set forth in the edition of one of the
following:
               1.   Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
Wastewater, 1980 edition.
               2.   Part 31 of the Standards of the American Society for
Testing and Materials 1981 edition.
               3.   Methods for Chemical Alalysis of Water and Wastes
Environmental Protection Agency, March 1979 edition.
               4.   Any other technique approved by the Administrator of the
U.S. EPA.
         C.   Monitoring facilities.  Each discharger shall provide and operate
at the discharger's own expense a  monitoring facility to allow inspection,
sampling and flow measurement of each sewer discharge to the City.  Each
monitoring facility shall be situated on the discharger's premises, except
where such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the
discharger, the City may concur with the facility being constructed in the
public street or sidewalk area provided that the facility is located so that it
will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.  There shall be ample
room in or near such sampling facility to allow accurate sampling and
preparation of samples for analysis.  The facility, sampling and measuring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition at the expense of the discharger.  All monitoring facilities shall be
constructed and maintained in accordance with all applicable local construction
standards and specifications.  Construction shall be completed within ninety
days of receipt of written notice from the City directing the discharger to
construct the facilities.
            All sewers shall have an inspection and sampling manhole or
structure with an opening of no less than twenty-four inches diameter and
internal diameter of no less than forty-eight inches containing flow measuring,
recording and sampling equipment as required by the City to ensure compliance
with this chapter.  Such structure may be utilized by the discharger for his
monitoring program if approved by the City.
         D.   Inspection and sampling.  The City may inspect the monitoring
facilities of any discharger to determine compliance with the requirements of
this chapter.  The discharger shall allow the City or its representatives to
enter upon the premises of the discharger at all reasonable hours, for the
purposes of inspection, sampling or records examination.  The City shall have
the right to set up on the discharger's property necessary devices to conduct
sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring, metering operation or all of
these.  The City shall have the right to copy the discharger's records relevant
to determining compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
         E.   Confidential information.  Information and data furnished to the
City with respect to the nature and frequency of discharge shall be available
to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the
discharger specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the City that the release of such information would divulge information,
processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets or
proprietary information of the discharger.  When requested by a discharger
furnishing a report, the portions of a report which may disclose trade secrets
or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public
but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for
uses related to this chapter, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit, the State Disposal System permit, the pretreatment
programs or all of these, provided however, that such portions of a report
shall be available for use by the State or any State agency in judicial review
or enforcement involving the discharger furnishing the report.  Wastewater
constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential
information.  Information accepted by the City as confidential shall not be
transmitted to any party except as provided herein and unless a ten-day
notification is given to the discharger.
            (Ord. 84-6.  Passed 2-2-84.)
   933.07  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Violations.  No person or discharger shall violate any provision,
regulation or requirement of this chapter.
   (b)   Notice of Violation.  Whenever the City finds a discharger in

be conducted.  He shall determine the order in which the hearing shall proceed.
   At the hearing the discharger or its representative or attorney shall be
permitted to present its position, arguments and contentions.  Evidence may be
admitted and witnesses may be examined and cross-examined to either support the
discharger's position or to refute evidence and testimony offered by the City. 
Further, the right to proffer evidence into the record shall be recognized. 
All witnesses shall be placed under oath and the Director shall permit
subpoenas to be issued upon written request.  If neither the discharger or its
authorized representative appear at the hearing, the Director shall proceed
with the hearing.
   Within thirty days from the date of the hearing, the Director shall render
his decision in writing, supported by conclusions of fact supporting his
decision, to all parties.  The Director may order any appropriate relief
including dismissal of the Municipal citation or termination of wastewater

decision may appeal to the Common Pleas Court according to law.
   (d)   Enforcement Actions; Annual Publication.  A list of all significant
dischargers which were the subject of enforcement proceedings pursuant to
subsections (b) and (c) hereof during the twelve previous months, shall be
annually published by the City in a newspaper published in the City,
summarizing the enforcement actions taken against the dischargers during the
same twelve months whose violations remained uncorrected forty-five or more
days after notification of noncompliance; or which have exhibited a pattern of
noncompliance over that twelve-month period, or which involve failure to
accurately report noncompliance.
   (e)   Operating Upsets.  Any discharger which experiences an upset in
operations which places the discharger in a temporary state of noncompliance
with this chapter shall inform the City thereof within twenty-four hours of
first awareness of the commencement of the upset.  Where such information is
given orally, a written follow-up report thereof shall be filed by the
discharger with the City within five days.  The report shall specify:
      (1)   Description of the upset, the cause thereof and the upset's impact
on a discharger's compliance status.
      (2)   Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance, and if the noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance
is reasonably expected to occur.
      (3)   All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of such an upset or other conditions of noncompliance.
   (f)   Other Remedies.  Notwithstanding any other enforcement procedure
listed in this chapter, whenever it is determined there is a substantial danger
to the public health or welfare or a substantial danger to the environment or
of interference to the POTW due to the acts or omission of any discharger, the
City may, through its appropriate officials, seek a temporary restraining
order, temporary or permanent injunction or abatement in the Court of Common
Pleas and shall not be required under these conditions to exhaust the
administrative procedures within this chapter as a condition precedent to the
commencement of such action.
   Notwithstanding any other enforcement procedure listed in this chapter, or
in conjunction with any other enforcement procedure, the City may seek to
terminate the wastewater treatment services to any discharger which fails to
factually report the wastewater concentrations and characteristics of its
discharge; report significant changes in the wastewater concentration or
discharge; refuse reasonable access to the discharger's premises by
representatives of the authority for the purpose of inspection or monitoring;
or violates the conditions of this chapter, or any final administrative order
entered with respect thereto.
   Any discharge of any sewage, industrial waste pollutant, toxic pollutant or
other waste into the POTW system in violation of any provision, regulation or
requirement of this chapter is declared to be a public nuisance and may be
enjoined by the City through its appropriate officials in the Court of Common
Pleas.

   937.01  PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable stormwater management standards to achieve a level
of stormwater quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City of Ontario:
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the City of Ontario to:
      (1)   Control stormwater runoff from their property and ensure that all
Stormwater Control Measures (SCMs) are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and groundwater are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
      (8)   Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation. 
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the City of Ontario's
future expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in Section
937.01.
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Richland County, and the
City of Ontario shall comply with this regulation for roadway projects
initiated after approval of this regulation and, to the maximum extent
practicable, for projects initiated before that time.
   (e)   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
   (f)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility line
installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface as
determined by the city engineer.  Such projects must be designed to minimize
the number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear
construction projects must comply with the requirements of Chapter
1353 Erosion and Sediment Control.

(Ord. 16-39.  Passed 12-7-16.)
   937.09  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General:  The stormwater system, including SCMs for storage, treatment
and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm event; to maintain predevelopment
runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; and to meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources. 
The stormwater system shall function as an integrated system that controls
flooding and minimizes the degradation of the physical, biological, and
chemical integrity of the water resources receiving stormwater discharges from
the site.  Acceptable practices shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a watercourse restoration project and complies with Chapter
1354 Riparian Setback requirements.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
         E.   Be designed according to the methodology included in the most
current edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual or another design
manual acceptable for use by the City of Ontario and Ohio EPA.
   SCMs that meet the criteria in this regulation, and additional criteria
required by the city engineer, shall comply with this regulation.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use:  SCMs shall be designed to
achieve the stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be
compatible with the proposed post-construction use of the site, to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare, and to function safely with routine
maintenance.
      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots:  Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in Chapter
1115 Subdivision Procedures, shall provide stormwater management and water
quality controls for the development of all subdivided lots. This shall include
provisions for lot grading and drainage that prevent structure flooding during
the 100-year, 24-hour storm; and maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-
development runoff patterns, volumes, and peaks from each lot.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities in water resources:  SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the applicant
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as
required in Section
937.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1353 Erosion and Sediment Control Requirements and Chapter
1354 Riparian Setback, all as determined by the City Engineer.
      (5)   Surface conveyance channels:  All surface conveyance designs must
provide a minimum of one (1) foot freeboard above the projected peak stage
within the facility during the 100-year, 24-hour storm.  When designing
stormwater ponds and conveyance channels, the applicant shall consider public
safety as a design factor and alternative designs must be implemented where
site limitations would preclude a safe design.
      (6)   Exemption:  The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
937.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the city engineer that the
site is part of a larger common plan of development where the stormwater
management requirements for the site are provided by an existing SCMs, or if
the stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by practices
defined in a regional or local stormwater management plan approved by the city
engineer.
      (7)   Maintenance:  All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Agreements approved by the City Engineer as
detailed in Section
937.08.
      (8)   Ownership: Unless otherwise required by the City of Ontario, SCMs
serving multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot held and
maintained by an entity of common ownership or, if compensated by the property
owners, by the City of Ontario.  SCMs serving single lots shall be placed on
these lots, protected within an easement, and maintained by the property
owner. 
      (9)   Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage:  Practices that preserve
and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading and
compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing and
grubbing practices; and maintaining un-concentrated stormwater runoff to and
through these areas. Post-construction stormwater practices shall provide
perpetual management of runoff quality and quantity so that a receiving
stream's physical, chemical and biological characteristics are protected and
ecological functions are maintained.
      (10)   Preservation of Wetland Hydrology:  Concentrated stormwater runoff
from SCMs to wetlands shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff
enters the wetlands in order to protect the natural hydrology, hydroperiod, and
wetland flora.  The flow shall be released such that no erosion occurs down
slope.  Practices such as level spreaders, vegetative buffers, infiltration
basins, conservation of forest covers, and the preservation of intermittent
streams, depressions, and drainage corridors may be used to maintain the
wetland hydrology. 
If the applicant proposes to discharge to natural wetlands, a hydrological
analysis shall be performed to demonstrate that the proposed discharge matches
the pre-development hydroperiods and hydrodynamics that support the wetland.
   (b)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria: All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Surface water protection:  The city engineer may allow modification
to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only if the
applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio
EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local
agencies as required in Section
937.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Section
1353 Erosion and Sediment Control requirements and Chapter
1354 Riparian Setback, all as determined by the city engineer. At a minimum,
stream relocation designs must show how the project will minimize changes to
the vertical stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat of upstream
and downstream channels on and off the property.
      (2)   Off-site stormwater discharges:  Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm.  Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the stormwater quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city engineer that off-site
runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a manner
that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow:  The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible.  The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas.  In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed 1.5 acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or
other SCMs from areas too long and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all as
determined by the city engineer.
      (4)   Open channels:  Unless otherwise allowed by the city engineer,
drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided by an open channel with vegetated
banks and designed to carry the 10 year, 24 hour stormwater runoff from
upstream contributory areas. 
      (5)   Storm sewer systems: Storm sewers shall be designed in accordance
with the methodology outlined in the current version of the Ohio Department of
Transportation Location and Design Manual, Volume 2. In addition, the following
criteria shall be used to design storm sewer systems: 
         A.   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the 10 year, 24 hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway during a
25 year, 24 hour storm. The system shall be designed to meet these requirements
when conveying the flows from the contributing drainage area within the
proposed development and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream
from the development. 
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12 inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems,
subject to the approval of the city engineer.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water Resource Crossings. Water resource crossings shall be
designed in accordance with the methodology outlined in the current version of
the Ohio Department of Transportation Location and Design Manual, Volume 2. In
addition, the following criteria shall be used to design structures that cross
a water resource in the City of Ontario:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25 year, 24 hour storm.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
techniques and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development. 
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers,
coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams.  The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
(25) percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of 1 foot of box culverts
and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed.  The conduit or
conveyance must to be sized to carry the 25-year storm under these conditions.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12 inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource.  The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of 5 square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100 year,
24 hour storm, or the 100 year flood elevation as determined by FEMA, whichever
is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding:  Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100 year, 24 hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained within the
drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause flooding of
buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface elevation
along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot below the finished grade
elevation of all structures. When designing the flood routing paths, the
conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the City of Ontario must
be compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume. First consideration
for the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be given to areas
where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new floodplain
within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also be given to
enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for floodplain
fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing watershed. Unless
otherwise permitted by the City of Ontario, reductions in volume due to
floodplain fills must be mitigated within the legal boundaries of the
development.  Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage areas must
reasonably conform to the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The
use of vertical retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation:  Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected. 
   (c)   Stormwater Quality Control: 
      (1)   Direct runoff to an SCM:  The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one or more of the following SCMs.  These practices are listed in
Table 2 of this regulation and shall be designed to meet the following general
performance standards:
         A.   Extended detention facilities that detain stormwater; settle or
filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled stormwater to a water
resource.
         B.   Infiltration facilities that retain stormwater; promote settling,
filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate captured stormwater
into the ground. The city engineer may require a soil engineering report to be
prepared for the site to demonstrate that any proposed infiltration facilities
meet these performance standards.
         C.   For sites less than five (5) acres, but required to create a
comprehensive stormwater management plan, the city engineer may approve other
SCMs if the applicant demonstrates to the city engineer's satisfaction that
these SCMs meet the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
937.09(c)(5).
         D.   For sites greater than five (5) acres, or less than five (5)
acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will
disturb five (5) or more acres, the city engineer may approve other SCMs if the
applicant demonstrates to the city engineer's satisfaction that these SCMs meet
the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
937.09(c)(5), and has prior written approval from the Ohio EPA.
         E.   For the construction of new roads and roadway improvement
projects by public entities (i.e. the state, counties, townships, cities, or
villages), the city engineer may approve SCMs not included in Table 2 of this
regulation, but must show compliance with the current version of the Ohio
Department of Transportation "Location and Design Manual, Volume Two Drainage
Design". 
      (2)   Criteria applying to all SCMs: SCMs chosen must be sized to treat
the water quality volume (WQv) and to ensure compliance with Ohio Water Quality
Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1). 
         A.   The WQv shall be equal to the volume of runoff from a 0.75 inch
rainfall event and shall be determined according to one of the following
methods:
            1.   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the city engineer
that uses continuous hydrologic simulation; site-specific hydrologic
parameters, including impervious area, soil infiltration characteristics,
slope, and surface routing characteristics; proposed SCMs controlling the
amount and/or timing of runoff from the site; and local long-term hourly
records, or
            2.   Using the following equation:
               WQV = C*P*A/12   
               where terms have the following meanings:
               WQV   = water quality volume in acre-feet
               C = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1 in.
               P= 0.75 inch precipitation depth
               A= area draining into the stormwater practice, in acres.
               Runoff coefficients required by the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency (Ohio EPA) for use in determining the WQv can be determined
using the list in Table 1 or using the following equation to calculate the
runoff coefficient:
               C=0.858i3 - 0.78i2 + 0.774i+0.04, where:
               i = fraction of the drainage area that is impervious
Table 1: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
Where land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated
using a weighted average.  For example, if 60% of the contributing drainage
area to the stormwater treatment structure is Low Density Residential, 30% is
High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff coefficient is
calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3)+(0.3)(0.5)+(0.1)(0.2) = (0.35)
         B.   An additional volume equal to 20% of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the stormwater practice for sediment storage.  This volume
shall be incorporated into the sections of stormwater practices where
pollutants will accumulate.
         C.   Each individual SCM must be sized to treat the WQv associated
with its entire contributing drainage area.  Exceptions to this may be granted
by the city engineer and/or the OEPA on a case-by-case basis.
         D.   Stormwater quality management practices shall be designed such
that the drain time is long enough to provide treatment and protect against
downstream bank erosion, but short enough to provide storage available for
successive rainfall events as defined in Table 2.
      (3)   Each practice shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
vegetation management, debris control, and other maintenance activities defined
in the Inspection Plan and Maintenance Agreement for the site.

•   Pocket Wetland7                               24 hours
1 Practices designed to fully infiltrate the WQv shall empty within 48 hours
to provide storage for subsequent storm events.
2 The use of a forebay and micropool is required on all dry extended detention
basins.  Each is to be sized at a minimum 10% of the WQv. 
3 Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized with at least 0.75*WQv .
4 Extended detention shall be provided for the WQv above the permanent water
pool.
5 The surface ponding area shall completely empty within 24 hours so that
there is no standing water.  Shorter drawdown times are acceptable as long as
design criteria in Rainwater and Land Development have been met.
6 This includes grassed linear bioretention, which was previously titled
enhanced water quality swale.
7 Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with 25% of the WQv
in a pool and 75% in marshes.  The EDv above the permanent pool must be equal
to the WQv.
      (4)   Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities.
         A.   Infiltration facilities should be designed to meet all criteria
in the current edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
through a pretreatment practice such as a grass channel or filter strip to
remove coarser sediments that could cause a loss of infiltration capacity.
         C.   During construction, all runoff from disturbed areas of the site
shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site.  No
construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin site to
avoid soil compaction.
      (5)   Additional criteria for extended detention facilities:
         A.   The outlet shall be designed to not release more than the first
half of the water quality volume in less than 1/3rd of the drain time. The
outlet shall be designed to minimize clogging, vandalism, maintenance, and
promote the capture of floatable pollutants.
         B.   The basin design shall incorporate the following features to
maximize multiple uses, aesthetics, safety, and maintainability:
            1.   Basin side slopes above the permanent pool shall have a run to
rise ratio of 3:1 or flatter.
            2.   The perimeter of all permanent pool areas deeper than 4 feet
shall be surrounded by an aquatic bench that extends at least 8 feet and no
more than 15 feet outward from the normal water edge. The 8 feet wide portion
of the aquatic bench closest to the shoreline shall have an average depth of 6
inches below the permanent pool to promote the growth of aquatic vegetation. 
The remainder of the aquatic bench shall be no more than 15 inches below the
permanent pool to minimize drowning risk to individuals who accidentally or
intentionally enter the basin, and to limit growth of dense vegetation in a
manner that allows waves and mosquito predators to pass through the
vegetation.  The maximum slope of the aquatic bench shall be 10 (H) to 1 (V). 
The aquatic bench shall be planted with native plant species comparable to
wetland vegetation that are able to withstand prolonged inundation. The use of
invasive plant species is prohibited.
            3.   A forebay designed to allow larger sediment particles to
settle shall be placed at all basin inlets.  The forebay and micropool volume
shall be equal to at least 10% of the water quality volume (WQv).
            4.   Detention basins shall be provided with an emergency drain,
where practicable, so that the basin may be emptied if the primary outlet
becomes clogged and/or to drain the permanent pool to facilitate maintenance. 
The emergency drain should be designed to drain by gravity where possible.
            5.   Detention basins shall be provided with an emergency spillway
and associated freeboard, designed in accordance with the methodology outlined
in the current edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual, Appendix 1
or the current edition of NRCS 378, whichever provides a more conservative
design.
      (6)   Criteria for the Acceptance of Alternative post-construction SCMs: 
The applicant may request approval from the city engineer for the use of
alternative structural post-construction SCMs if the applicant shows to the
satisfaction of the city engineer that these SCMs are equivalent in pollutant
removal and runoff flow/volume reduction effectiveness to those listed in Table
2.  If the site is greater than five (5) acres, or less than five (5) acres but
part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will disturb five (5)
or more acres, prior approval from the Ohio EPA is necessary. To demonstrate
the equivalency, the applicant must show: 
         A.   The alternative SCM has a minimum total suspended solid (TSS)
removal efficiency of 80 percent, using the Level II Technology Acceptance
Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) testing protocol.
         B.   The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected SCM is
reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be negligible
hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the State.  The discharge
rate from the SCM will have negligible impacts if the applicant can demonstrate
one of the following conditions:
            1.   The entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater.
            2.   The development will create less than one acre of impervious
surface.
            3.   The development project is a redevelopment project with an
ultra-urban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where 100 percent of
the project area is already impervious surface and the stormwater discharge is
directed into an existing storm sewer system.
            4.   The stormwater drainage system of the development discharges
directly into a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where
the development area is less than 5 percent of the water area upstream of the
development site, unless a (TMDL) has identified water quality problems in the
receiving surface water of the State.
   (d)   Stormwater Quantity Control: The Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions.  The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (3)   The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method or other
hydrologic method approved by the city engineer, the total volume (acre-feet)
of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring on the development drainage
area before and after development. These calculations shall meet the following
standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   The runoff volume and peak flow rates for all directly
connected impervious areas should be calculated independently of other land
uses and disconnected impervious area. Sites with disconnected impervious areas
may be permitted to use a composite runoff curve number to determine runoff
volumes and peak flow rates. Directly connected impervious areas are those
impervious areas that are hydraulically connected to the conveyance system
(i.e. streets with curbs, catch basins, storm drains, etc.) and thence to the
basin outlet point (i.e. a retention/detention pond, existing storm sewer/ditch
system, natural water body, etc.) without flowing over pervious areas. For
example, roof drains that are piped to the back of curb, which then flows to a
curb and gutter inlet, which conveys the runoff to a storm sewer system that
conveys the runoff to a wet detention basin is considered a directly connected
impervious area.
            4.   Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, time of
concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
            5.   Rainfall Depth - For the most accurate, up-to-date, location-
specific rainfall data for stormwater design, use the Precipitation-Frequency
Atlas of the United States, NOAA Atlas 14, Vol 2(3). available online: http://
hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.
            6.   Temporal Distribution - Use the SCS Type II rainfall
distribution for all design events with a recurrence interval greater than 1
year.  Include lot coverage assumptions used for full build out of the proposed
condition.
            7.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition shall reflect
the average type of land use over the past 10 years and not only the current
land use.
               i.   Pre-development Curve Numbers - For wooded or brushy areas,
use listed values from TR-55 NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
1986 in good hydrologic condition. For meadows, use listed values. For
impervious area that has been in place prior to the implementation of the City
of Ontario Stormwater Management Ordinance of 1986, use listed values. For all
other areas (including impervious area added after 1986 and all types of
agriculture), use pasture, grassland, or range in good hydrologic condition.
               ii.   Post-development Curve Numbers - Open space areas shall
use post-construction HSGs from the current edition of the Rainwater and Land
Development Manual unless the soil is amended after development according to
the following protocol: till the subsoil to 15-18 inches, then till using a
chisel, spader, or rotary tillage and incorporate compost through top 12
inches, replace topsoil to a minimum depth of 4 inches.  All undisturbed areas
or open space with amended soils shall be treated as "open space in good
condition."
            8.   Time of Concentration - Use velocity based methods from (TR-55
NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology in Small Watersheds, 1986) to estimate travel time
(Tt) for overland (sheet) flow, shallow concentrated flow and channel flow.
               i.   Maximum sheet flow length is 100 ft.
            9.   The volume reduction provided by permeable pavement,
bioretention, or other LID SCMs may be subtracted from the post development
stormwater volume.  Volume reductions for these practices may be demonstrated
using methods outlined in the current edition of the Rainwater and Land
Development Manual or a hydrologic model acceptable to the city engineer.
         B.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface proposed in the site
description except in instances of engineered permeable pavement systems. From
the volume determined in Section
937.09(D)(3)(a), determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to
development. Using the percentage, select the 24-hour Critical Storm from Table
3.
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
 
If the Percentage of Increase in                The Critical Storm will be:
Volume of Runoff is:
Equal to or Greater Than:        and Less Than:
---                              10             1 year
10                               20             2 year
20                               50             5 year
50                               100            10 year
100                              250            25 year
250                              500            50 year
500                              ---            100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the Critical Storm is a 5-year
storm.  The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this
frequency shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate
from the 1-year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the
development drainage area.  The post-development runoff from all less
frequent storms need only be controlled to meet pre-development peak
discharge rates for each of those same storms.
   (e)   Stormwater Management on Redevelopment Projects.
      (1)   Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans for redevelopment
projects shall reduce existing site impervious areas by at least 20 percent.  A
one-for-one credit towards the 20 percent net reduction of impervious area can
be obtained through the use of green roofs. Where site conditions prevent the
reduction of impervious area, SCMs shall be implemented to treat at least 20
percent of the WQv.
      (2)   When a combination of impervious area reduction and stormwater
quality control facilities are used, ensure a 20 percent net reduction of the
site impervious area, provide for treatment of at least 20 percent of the WQv,
or a combination of the two. 
Where projects are a combination of new development and redevelopment, the
total water quality volume required to be treated shall be calculated by a
weighted average based on acreage, with the new development at 100 percent
water quality volume and redevelopment at 20 percent. Where conditions prevent
impervious area reduction or on-site stormwater management for redevelopment
projects, practical alternatives as detailed in Section
937.10 may be approved by the City Engineer.
         (Ord. 16-39.  Passed 12-7-16.)
   937.10  ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   (a)   When the City of Ontario determines that site constraints compromise
the intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used that result in
an improvement of water quality and a reduction of stormwater quantity. Such
alternatives shall meet the following standards:
      (1)   Shall achieve the same level of stormwater quantity and quality
control that would be achieved by the on-site controls required under this
regulation.
      (2)   Implemented in the same Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 12 watershed
unit as the proposed development project.
      (3)   The mitigation ratio of the water quality volume is 1.5 to 1 or the
water quality volume at the point of retrofit, whichever is greater. 
      (4)   An inspection and maintenance agreement as described in Chapter
937.08.D.10 is established to ensure operations and treatment in perpetuity.
      (5)   Obtain prior written approval from Ohio EPA.
   (b)   Alternative actions may include, but are not limited to the
following.  All alternative actions shall be approved by the city engineer:
      (1)   Fees, in an amount specified by the City of Ontario to be applied
to community-wide SCMs.
      (2)   Implementation of off-site SCMs and/or the retrofit of an existing
practice to increase quality and quantity control.
      (3)   Stream, floodplain, or wetland restoration.
      (4)   Acquisition or conservation easements on protected open space
significantly contributing to stormwater control such as wetland complexes.
         (Ord. 16-39.  Passed 12-7-16.)
   937.11  EASEMENTS.
   Access to SCMs as required by the city engineer for inspections and
maintenance shall be secured by easements.  The following conditions shall
apply to all easements:
   (a)   Easements shall be included in the Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement submitted with the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan. 
   (b)   Easements shall be approved by the City of Ontario prior to approval
of a final plat and shall be recorded with the Richland County Auditor and on
all property deeds.
   (c)   Unless otherwise required by the city engineer, access easements
between a public right-of-way and all SCMs shall be no less than 25-feet wide.
The easement shall also incorporate the entire practice plus an additional 25-
foot wide band around the perimeter of the SCM.
   (d)   The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to allow
maintenance equipment  to access and manipulate around and within each
facility, as defined in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
     (e)   Easements to structural SCMs shall be restricted against the
construction therein of buildings, fences, walls, and other structures that may
obstruct the free flow of stormwater and the passage of inspectors and
maintenance equipment; and against the changing of final grade from that
described by the final grading plan approved by the City of Ontario.  Any re-
grading and/or obstruction placed within a maintenance easement may be removed
by the City of Ontario at the property owner's expense. 
(Ord. 16-39.  Passed 12-7-16.)
   937.12  MAINTENANCE AND FINAL INSPECTION APPROVAL.
   To receive final inspection and acceptance of any project, or portion
thereof, the following must be completed by the applicant and provided to the

portions thereof that would be degraded by construction site sediment until the
entire area tributary to the structure has reached final stabilization as
determined by the city engineer. This occurs after the completion of the final
grade at the site, after all of the utilities are installed, and the site is
subsequently stabilized with vegetation or other appropriate methods.  The
developer must provide documentation acceptable to the city engineer to
demonstrate that the site is completely stabilized.  Upon this proof of
compliance, the water quality structure(s) may be completed and placed into
service.    Upon completion of installation of these practices, all disturbed

(Ord. 03-49.  Passed 9-4-03.)
 
   938.07  DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   Prohibition of Illegal Discharges. No person shall discharge or cause
to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses any
materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any
pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality
standards, other than storm water.  The commencement, conduct or continuance of
any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as
described as follows:
      (1)   The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this chapter: water line flushing or other potable water
sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising
ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped
ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater
dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs,

fire fighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the authorized enforcement
agency as being necessary to protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal
notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of the
test.
      (4)   The prohibition shall not apply to any non-storm water discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the storm drain system.
 
   (b)   Prohibition of Illicit Connections.
      (1)   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of
illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
      (2)   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      (3)   A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection
to continue.
         (Ord. 03-49.  Passed 9-4-03.)
 
   938.08  SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
   (a)   Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. The
authorized enforcement agency may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge
access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the
MS4 or Waters of the State.  If the violator fails to comply with a suspension
order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such
steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or Waters of
the State, or to minimize danger to persons.
 
   (b)   Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge.  Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge.  The
authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the proposed
termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the City Engineer’s
office for a reconsideration and hearing.
 
   (c)   A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this Section, without the prior approval of the
City Engineer.
(Ord. 03-49.  Passed 9-4-03.)
 
   938.09  INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm
water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof
of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the City
Engineer prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. 
(Ord. 03-49.  Passed 9-4-03.)
 
   938.10  MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (a)   Applicability.  This section applies to all facilities that have storm
water discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
 
   (b)   Access to Facilities.
      (1)   The authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter and
inspect facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the City Engineer.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agency
ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the
conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and the performance of
any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.
      (3)   The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up on
any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the City
Engineer to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's storm water
discharge.
      (4)   The authorized enforcement agency has the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense.  All
devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the City Engineer and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement agency
access to a permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit
and of this chapter.  A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES
permit to discharge storm water associated with industrial activity commits an
offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable
access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity
authorized or required by this chapter.
      (7)   If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to any
part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
ordinance or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the City may seek issuance
of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
         (Ord. 03-49.  Passed 9-4-03.)
 
   938.11  REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORM WATER POLLUTANTS
BY THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The City will adopt requirements identifying Best Management Practices for
any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution
or contamination of storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of the
State. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge
of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system
or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs.
Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be,
the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said
person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing
the discharge of storm water associated with industrial activity, to the extent
practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section.
These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as
necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. 03-49.  Passed 9-4-03.)
 
   938.12  WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse.
(Ord. 03-49.  Passed 9-4-03.)
 
   938.13  NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or water of the State
said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the City Engineer
in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the City Engineer within three business days of the
phone notice.  If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a
commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and
the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for
at least three years.
(Ord. 03-49.  Passed 9-4-03.)
 
   938.14  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Notice of Violation.  Whenever the authorized enforcement agency finds
that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of

   1117.01  PURPOSE.
   The following provisions describe the design principles and standards which
a subdivider shall be required to follow in the layout of a subdivision.  The
principles and standards shall be carried out in compliance with the following:
  this chapter, other regulations of the State, and the specifications for each
of the various improvements as may be required by the City Engineer and the
Richland County Health Department, according to the nature of the improvements.
(Ord. 77-19.  Passed 6-2-77.)
   1117.02  PHYSICAL CONSIDERATIONS.
   Major and minor subdivisions shall be planned to take advantage of the
topographic conditions of the land, to economize in the construction of public
facilities and services and to reduce the amount of grading and minimize the
destruction of trees, lakes, watercourses and topsoil.
(Ord. 77-19.  Passed 6-2-77.)
   1117.03  MINOR SUBDIVISION.
   (a)   Lots.
      (1)   Zoning conformance.  The lot size, width, depth and the minimum
building setback lines shall conform to the existing zoning regulations.
      (2)   Lot depth.  No lot depth shall exceed three and one-half (3 1/2)
times the lot width.
   (b)   Storm Sewers.
      (1)   If the minor subdivision is in an area where a public storm water
system is not available, the subdivider shall do such grading and provide such
drainage structures as may be required by the City Engineer.
      (2)   Where a storm drainage system is reasonably accessible, as
determined by the City Engineer, the subdivider shall extend and connect with
such storm drainage system and shall do such grading and provide such drainage
structures as may be required by the City Engineer.
   (c)   Water Supply and Sanitary Sewers.  Where public water supply and
sanitary sewer facilities are not available, the subdivider of a minor
subdivision shall determine that individual water wells and sanitary sewer
disposal facilities can be constructed for each lot in the subdivision as
required by the Mansfield-Richland County Health Department, City of Mansfield,
City of Ontario or other agency having jurisdiction in accordance with the Ohio
Revised Code.
(Ord. 77-19.  Passed 6-2-77.)

Secondary street 80
Collector street 60
Minor street     60
         A.   Where a street is planned as an extension of an existing street
having a greater width than specified above, the Planning Commission may
require that the new extension of the street have the same width as that of the
existing section.
         B.   A minimum corner radii of twenty feet shall be provided at the
intersection of the street right-of-way line.
         C.   Where a boulevard type street is proposed, the minimum right-of-
way shall be increased by an amount equal to the width of the proposed median.
      (3)   Street design standards.
         A.   Widths of pavement and rights-of-way shall comply with the
standards set forth in the following table:

cul-de-sacs shall not be longer than 800 feet and shall be provided at the
closed end with a turn-around having an outside pavement diameter of at least
100 feet and a street right-of-way line diameter of at least 120 feet.
      (6)   Reserve strips.  Reserve strips preventing access to streets from
adjoining property shall be prohibited.
      (7)   Alignment.
         A.   Horizontal.
            1.   Street Jogs - street jogs with a centerline offset of less
than 150 feet shall not be permitted.
            2.   Intersections - streets shall be laid out to intersect as
nearly as possible at right angles and no streets shall intersect any other
street at an angle of less than eighty degrees.  Multiple intersections
involving junctions of more than two streets shall be avoided.
            3.   Angle Turns - angle turns not complying with the standard of
radius of curvature set forth in Section
1117.04(a)(3) above may be permitted on minor streets where such alignment
results in more efficient use of the land.  Where an angle turn is permitted,
there shall be provided on the outside of the turn in alignment an "eyebrow" or
"bubble" in the form of a segment of a circle.  The radius of such circle may
be drawn from a point between the centerline and outside right-of-way line, as
may be required to provide for adequate lot width at the street line.  The
right-of-way line on the inside of the turn (opposite the "eyebrow") shall have
a minimum radius of twenty feet.  The centerlines of street sections on either
side of an angle turn shall form an angle of no less than eighty-five degrees. 
The pavement design at such turn shall be as follows:
               a.   The inside of the angle turn, the curb or pavement edge
shall have a minimum radius of twenty feet.
               b.   At the outside of the angle turn, a paved area shall be

streets have a minimum tangent between them of 100 feet, 500 feet on secondary
streets and primary streets.
         B.   Vertical.  Grade at intersection - approaches to intersections
shall be reduced to a grade not exceeding three percent (3%) for a distance of
not less than 100 feet.*
            Maximum grade at intersection may be exceeded due to steep
topography or subsoil conditions in accordance with the application of standard
engineering practice.
      (8)   Street names.  No street names shall be used which will duplicate
or be confused with the names of existing streets within the County.  Street
names shall be subject to approval by the Planning Commission.  All new streets
shall be named in the following manner:
 
General Direction Long Street Short Street
North and south   Streets     Courts
East and west     Avenues     Places
Diagonal          Roads       Ways
Curving           Drives      Circles or lanes
*Less than 1,000 lineal feet in length.
Note:  The use of the name "boulevard" may be used by new streets having a
median strip separating the opposing flow of traffic.
      (9)   Whenever boulevard streets are proposed, the subdivider or
developer shall submit to the Planning Commission a written agreement for the
maintenance of all median strips and the  lawn areas and plantings therein. 
Maintenance shall be the responsibility of the developer or an association of
home owners whose lots abut onto the proposed boulevard.
      (10)   Private streets.
         A.   Private streets shall meet all requirements for minor public
streets.  The Planning Commission may require certain streets within a
development to be public if it is determined that the projected density
necessitates the use of public streets and that traffic connections to adjacent
plats or developments are required for adequate circulation.
         B.   Where private streets are proposed the developer or persons
seeking approval of such plat shall, prior to such approval provide and submit
to the Commission copies of protective covenants, easements and documents to be
recorded, providing for the ownership, maintenance, repair and financing of the
private streets.  Reference to these protective covenants shall be included in
all deeds conveying the lots and lands described within the subdivision plat. 
The maintenance and repair of private streets shall not be the responsibility
of the public.
            (Ord. 07-27.  Passed 8-16-07.)
   (b)   Easements.
      (1)   Utility easements.  Electric and telephone lines may be buried if
located at the front of the lots.  Easements centered on rear or side lot lines
shall be provided for utilities and shall be at least twenty feet wide.
      (2)   Drainage way easements.  Where a subdivision is traversed by a
drainage way, a storm water easement or drainage right-of-way, a public
easement conforming substantially with the lines of such drainage shall be
provided.  The easement or right-of-way shall be twenty feet wide or of such
further width as necessary and shall generally follow rear and side lot lines.
   (c)   Blocks.
      (1)   Block lengths shall not exceed 1,800 feet or be less than 400 feet.
      (2)   Pedestrian walkways, with right-of-way, not less than twelve feet
wide, may be required across blocks where the Planning Commission deems that
pedestrian access to schools, playgrounds, parks, open space shopping centers
and other community facilities are necessary.
   (d)   Lots.
      (1)   Zoning conformance.  The lot size, width, depth and the minimum
building setback lines shall conform to the existing zoning and Health
Department regulations.
      (2)   Corner lots.  Corner lots shall have extra width to permit
appropriate building setback from and orientation to both streets.
      (3)   Access to public streets.  The subdivision of land shall provide
each lot with satisfactory access to an existing public street.
      (4)   Double frontage lots.  Residential lots shall not be laid out so
that they have frontage on more than one street except:
         A.   Where lots are adjacent to the intersection of two streets, or
         B.   Where it is necessary to separate residential from major arterial
thoroughfares.
         Where double frontage lots are created adjacent to an expressway or a
primary street, a reserve strip twelve feet wide along the street shall be
deeded to the City.  The plat shall state that there shall be no right of
access across such reserve strip.  The Planning Commission may require that a
ten foot wide planting screen be provided along the boundary of the reserve
strip.
      (5)   Lot depth.  No lot depth shall exceed three and one-half times the
lot width.
   (e)   Public Sites and Open Spaces.
      (1)   Public facilities.  The subdivision design shall provide land areas
for public use as provided in Section
1119.04 .
      (2)   Open space subdivisions.  Open space subdivision layout shall be
encouraged with ownership and maintenance of Homeowner's Association.
      (3)   Natural features preservation.  Natural features such as scenic
view, water bodies, fine groves of trees shall be given due consideration for
their preservation.
   (f)   Utilities.
      (1)   Storm sewers.
         A.   Storm drainage.  The design of the subdivision shall provide the
necessary means to assure complete drainage in and adjacent to the property to
be developed or subdivided.
            The subdivider or his engineer shall submit all drainage
calculations along with the improvement plans.  A ten year storm frequency is
to be used along with suitable runoff factors for the completed development
both within the subdivider's property and all lands upstream from the
subdivider's property.
            The design storm flow is calculated in an amount which can be

acceptance.  Tests shall be made from manhole to manhole or as may be ordered
by the City Engineer.  The maximum allowable infiltration shall be 200 gallons
per inch of pipe diameter per mile per day.  Exfiltration tests may be required
by the City Engineer and the allowance shall be increased an additional ten
percent (10%) for each additional two foot of head over a basic two foot
minimum internal head.
            As an alternate to the above, the contractor may perform a low
pressure air test.  The method referred to as "air testing" consists of
applying low pressure air to the section of sewer to be tested and recording
the length of time in minutes for the internal air pressure to decrease from
three and one-half to two and one-half pounds per square inch (greater than the
average back pressure of any ground water that may submerge the pipe).  The
time elapsed shall not be less than the time shown for the given size pipe per
100 foot of pipe in a table which is based on equations from ASTM C 828 which
will be furnished by the City Engineer.  All methods, materials, equipment and
procedures shall be in accordance with the requirements of the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency.
            All materials and equipment required for "tests" shall be furnished
by the developer or contractor at their own expense.

   1119.04  PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACE.
   (a)   Public Building Sites.
      (1)   At the preliminary plan stage, the Planning Commission shall notify
governmental and public agencies that a subdivision is being proposed.  The
Planning Commission shall designate a period of twenty-one days within which
such agencies shall determine if land within the subdivision is required for
their use as a public building site and to so advise the Planning Commission in
writing of the proposed use and the area required.  If, within the designated
time, such requirement is deemed to exist, the subdivider shall be notified
during the preliminary plan stage.
      (2)   If there is no response from an agency within the designated time,
then the preliminary plan stage shall continue without further consideration of
such sites.
      (3)   If an agency responds with a need for land within the designated
time, then the Planning Commission shall forthwith assist with negotiations for
the same between the subdivider and the agency in this regard and the sites
shall be available to the requesting entity by one of the following methods:
         A.   Statutory dedication without compensation to the subdivider.
         B.   Statutory dedication with reasonable compensation to the
subdivider.
         C.   Appropriation by the City or public agency.
         D.   Reservation by appropriate legal instrument for acquisition of a
period of one year after the approval of the preliminary plan.  Such
reservation shall provide for the specific release of the land from these
requirements reverting full legal title to the subdivider, or his successors or
assigns if the agency has not obtained a contract to acquire the land or has
not filed appropriate proceedings within the one year limitation.
         E.   Any other method arrived at by mutual agreement.
      (4)   Failure of the Planning Commission to notify an agency under
subsection (a)(1) hereof shall not create any rights in such body and shall
have the same effect as making no response after being notified and shall not
make defective the subsequent subdivision proceedings hereunder.
   (b)   Open Space and Parks.
      (1)   There shall be no requirement of a subdivider to provide parks or
other open space except as required or specified in applicable zoning
regulations.
      (2)   When the City desires land within the subdivision for such use,
then such governmental agency within the time designated in the notice under
subsection (a)(1) hereof shall notify the subdivider through the Planning
Commission.
      (3)   The City shall specify the quantity, description, location and use
(passive or active) of the land so desired and designate the public entity that
would be responsible for the development and maintenance of the use and expense
thereof.
      (4)   If the City specifies its desire, as set forth in subsection (b)(3)
hereof, then the Planning Commission shall forthwith assist with negotiations
for the same between the subdivider and the City and land shall be available by
one of the following methods:
         A.   Statutory dedication without compensation to the subdivider to
the City to accept the same and to maintain and develop the land.
         B.   Statutory dedication with reasonable compensation to the
subdivider to the City to accept the same and to maintain and develop the land.
         C.   Reservation by appropriate legal instrument for acquisition of a
defined area by the City to accept, develop and maintain the same for the
specific use for a period of one year after the approval of the preliminary
plan.  Such reservation shall provide for the specific release of the land from
these requirements reverting legal title to the subdivider, or his successors
or assigns if the City has not obtained a contract to acquire the land or has
not filed appropriation proceedings within the one year limitation.
         D.   Any other method arrived at by mutual agreement, including the
reservation or grant of land by private deed or covenants for the use of the
property owners within the proposed subdivision with provision being made for
the development and maintenance thereof.
      (5)   The City may encourage open space subdivisions wherein private
property owners through the use of a homeowner's association will conserve and
maintain open space and recreation areas for the private use of property owners
within the subdivision. 
      (6)   Failure of the Planning Commission to notify a governmental agency
under subsection (b)(2) hereof on the preceding page shall not create any
rights in such agency and shall have the same effect as making no response
after being notified and shall not make defective the subsequent subdivision
proceedings hereunder.
   (c)   Property Reservation.  Any reservation of property for a period of one
year referred to above shall be null and void if the subdivision plat of which
it is a part does not receive final approval or is withdrawn before final
approval by the subdivider.  It is the intent herein not to create a burden on
the land if it is not to be subdivided.  Any legal instrument creating such a
reservation shall so state.
(Ord. 77-19.  Passed 6-2-77.)
   1119.05  EXTRA SIZE AND OFF SITE IMPROVEMENTS.
   When streets or utilities are not available at the boundary of a proposed
subdivision there by necessitating off-site extensions or improvements of
streets or utilities, and when extra size (greater in size than is required to
serve the proposed subdivision) utility lines and streets are required for the
proper future growth of an area, the Planning Commission may require as a
condition precedent to approval of a preliminary plan and subdivision plat,
assurances that such off-site extensions and extra size improvements will be
provided in accordance with the following:
   (a)   Utility Extensions.  Utility extensions from the proposed subdivision
shall be installed and constructed in such a location, in such a manner and
size as to make their extension usable in accordance with governmental
regulations for servicing adjacent areas and with reference to drainage
utilities, such adjacent area shall include the downstream area of the
particular drainage district and the uphill drainage and extra size lines as
determined by reasonable engineering standards.
   (b)   Off-Site Extensions.  If the Planning Commission, in conjunction with
Council, finds that off-site extensions require crossing undeveloped lands and
that a special assessment would not be warranted against such lands until some
future time or if a governmental expenditure for such purpose is not then
warranted, and if this same condition exists on extra size facilities which
will later benefit and enhance other property, then the developer may be
required, as a condition to approval, to obtain all necessary easements or
rights of way and improvements so constructed shall be dedicated and granted to
the public and not maintained under private ownership.  All such improvements
shall be available for connections by developers of adjoining lands.
   (c)   Reimbursement.  To provide for reimbursement to the developer for
costs of such installation of off-site extensions and extra size facilities
(such costs to include construction costs, all engineering costs properly
allocated thereto and all costs for legal services allocated thereto, and any
other costs necessary and proper in determining the entire cost of such
improvement), contractural arrangements shall be made between Council and the
developer, approved by the City Engineer, setting forth the total amount of
reimbursement, together with a pro-rata usage reimbursement plan including the
nature and method of determining the amount of such reimbursement and the time
or times at which the same shall occur.  Such contractural arrangements shall
be accomplished and completed prior to the improvements being started.  It is
the intent to secure reimbursement to the developer at such time or times as
connections to the off-site improvements are made and extra size facilities are
used by developers of adjoining or benefiting lands.
      As future development occurs on adjoining or benefiting lands, the
original developer shall be reimbursed in accordance with the contractural
arrangements referred to above and each successive developer shall exhibit to
the Planning Commission a receipt showing reimbursement prior to final
subdivision approval relating to such adjoining or benefiting lands.
   (d)   Deposit.  Council may construct and pay for the off-site extensions
and extra size facilities and assess the costs to the owners benefited and
require a deposit from the developer as described in Section
1119.06 .  Council may establish a rotary fund to pay for such development
costs and not collect the assessment on the intervening land until it is
developed.
   (e)   Pro-Rating Costs.  In making determinations for pro-rating costs for
the construction off-site extensions or extra size improvements, the Planning
Commission shall consider, in addition to the standard set forth in this
section and other regulations of the State, or City, the following conditions.
      (1)   The relative location and size of the proposed subdivision.
      (2)   The traffic estimated to be generated by the development in
relation to present streets.
      (3)   The natural drainage area for sewers and service area for water.
      (4)   The development benefits that will accrue to the subdivision.
      (5)   The sequence of land and utility developments in the vicinity.
      (6)   Any other conditions it may deem necessary.
         (Ord. 77-19.  Passed 6-2-77.)
   1119.06  CONSTRUCTION IMPROVEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Preconstruction Meeting and Work Schedules.  Prior to any construction

materials which do not meet specification requirements or suspend the portion
of the work involved.
         Periodic inspection during the installation of improvements shall be
made by the City Engineer to insure conformity with the approved plans and
specifications as provided in the subdivider's construction agreement.
      (3)   Final inspection.  Upon completion of all improvements, the
subdivider shall request in writing a final inspection by the City Engineer as
required under Ohio R.C. 711.091.  The City Engineer shall make a final
inspection of all street improvements, storm and sanitary sewer and water
improvements.
   (c)   Construction Improvement Responsibilities.
      (1)   Cooperation of subdivider and/or contractor.  The subdivider shall
have available on the project, at all times, two copies of all approved
improvement plans and specifications.  He shall cooperate with the City
Engineer and with other contractors in every way possible.  The subdivider
shall at all times have a competent superintendent acting as his agent on the
project.  The superintendent shall be capable of reading and thoroughly
understanding the improvement plans and specifications and he shall receive
instructions from the Inspector.  The City Engineer's orders shall be excuted
without delay.
      (2)   Repair of damaged improvements.  Any damage done to the
improvements by construction traffic or by any other means shall be repaired or
the damaged materials replaced to the satisfaction of the City Engineer before
the next item of construction is begun.
      (3)   Maintenance of improvements.  The subdivider shall be responsible
for the maintenance of the improvements installed and shall be responsible for
providing the services necessary to guarantee access to all occupied lots,
including plowing snow, until final acceptance by the City.  The subdivider
shall be given notice by the City Engineer of the need for such maintenance or
service.  If the subdivider fails to perform such necessary maintenance or
service within thirty days from the date the notice was issued by the City
Engineer, the City may perform such service and bill the subdivider for such
service.  Payment shall be guaranteed by the performance bond.
   (d)   Assurance of Completion of Improvements Guarantee.
      (1)   Assurance of completion of improvements.  No lot, proposed lot, or
parcel of land which is subject to these Regulations shall be sold or leased,
until the improvements required by those regulations have been completed, or
assurance of their completion has been approved.  The assurance of completion
of improvements shall be satisfied by the furnishing of a performance bond, or
surety bond as approved by the Law Director.
When the performance bond and assurance of completion of improvements has been
satisfied, the City, if requested by the subdivider, will provide a written
document accepting the improvements for ownership and for future maintenance.
         (Ord. 05-58.  Passed 9-15-05.)
      (2)   Reduction of bond.  The developer shall give written notice to the
City Engineer when improvements covered by bond have been completed; that the

the developer, stating his approval or disapproval, as the case may be.  In the
event the City Engineer disapproves, he shall state his reasons for doing so in
a written report to both parties.
         Upon approval of the inprovements, the performance bond or surety bond
shall be replaced by a maintenance bond equal to ten percent (10%) of the
performance bond for a duration of one year.  This will be released after final
acceptance inspection.
      (3)   The subdivider shall furnish evidence of general public liability,
and property damage insurance coverage in the amounts of five hundred thousand
dollars ($500,000) for death of or injury to any one person, one million
dollars ($1,000,000) for death of or injury to two or more persons in any one
accident and five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) for property damage in
any one accident in an insurance company authorized to do business in the
State.  Such insurance shall indemnify and save harmless the City from any and

action of the Planning Commission, has all the rights of appeal as set forth in
Ohio R.C. Chapter 711 or any other applicable section of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 77-19.  Passed 6-2-77.)
   1121.08  CALCULATION AND COLLECTION OF FEES.
   The City Engineer will check all developer’s plans to determine compliance
with the zoning and subdivision regulations and to compute for actual costs of
the development to see that it coincides with the developer’s estimated cost of
the development.  The actual cost is the cost which the City would be required
to pay if it was required to contract for the construction of the
improvements.  It will be the duty of the City Engineer to collect this
information along with the inspection fee costs and supply the Developer, the
Service-Safety Director, the Zoning Inspector and the Treasurer with this
information.  This is to be completed after the final approval of the plans
that the Planning Commission has approved.  The Treasurer will collect the
inspection fees and notify the Service-Safety Director, Zoning Inspector, and
City Engineer that the fees have been paid.  All plans must be approved and
fees paid before any work is started. 
(Ord.  97-57.  Passed 9-25-97.)
   1121.99  PENALTY.
   The following penalties shall apply to the violations of these Regulations.
   (a)   Whoever violates any rule or regulation adopted by Council for the
purpose of setting standards and requiring and securing the construction of
improvements within a subdivision or fails to comply with any order pursuant
thereto is creating a public nuisance and the creation thereof may be enjoined
and maintenance thereof may be abated by action at suit of the City or any
citizen thereof.  Whoever violates these Regulations shall forfeit and pay not
less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than one thousand dollars
($1,000).  Such sum may be recovered with costs in a civil action brought in
the Court of Common Pleas of Richland County, Ohio.
   (b)   A County Recorder who records a plat contrary to the provisions of
these Regulations shall forfeit and pay not less than one hundred dollars
($100.00), nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), to be recovered with
costs in a civil action by the Law Director in the name and for the use of the
City.
   (c)   Whoever, being the owner or agent of the owner of any land within a
municipal corporation, transfers any lot, parcel or tract of such land from or
in accordance with a plat of a subdivision before such plat has been recorded
in the office of the County Recorder, shall forfeit and pay the sum of not less
than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00)
for each lot, parcel or tract of land so sold.  The description of such lot,
parcel or tract by metes and bounds in the deed or transfer shall not serve to
exempt the seller from the forfeiture provided in this section.  If such land
is within a municipal corporation, such sum may be recovered in a civil action
brought in the Court of Common Pleas of Richland County by the legal
representative of the City in the name of the City.
   (d)   Any person who disposes of, offers for sale or lease for a time
exceeding five years any lot or any part of a lot in a subdivision before

Appendices
 
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Appendices one through nineteen are present by way of example
only and in cases of conflict between the text and the appendices the text
shall control pursuant to Ordinance 97-57, passed September 25, 1997.
 
Appendix 1
 
   Subdivision Regulations.  Regulates the division of land, its planning and
development into what is known as a subdivision.
   Section   
1115.02      Minor Subdivision
   Section   
1115.03      Major Subdivision
   However, land divided under certain specifications or conditions is not
classified as a subdivision and therefore, the regulations of Sections
1115.02 and
1115.03 do not apply.
 
   Division of Land that Is a Subdivision.
   (a)   When a parcel of land shown as a unit or contiguous units on last
preceding tax role is divided into two or more parcels, sites or lots, any one
of which is less than five acres, for the purpose, now or in the future, for
transfer of ownership.
 
   (b)   Improvement of one or more parcels for residential and commercial or
industrial structures involving the allocation of land for opening, widening or
extending streets, except private streets for industrial structures.
 
   (c)   Division or allocation of land as open spaces, for owners, occupants
or tenants common use, or as easements for public sewer, water, storm drainage
or other public facilities.
 
   Division of Land Not a Subdivision.
   (a)   Some divisions of land are not subdivisions.
 
   (b)   If a division of land is not a subdivision then these Regulations do
not apply and no plat is required.
 
   (c)   The following divisions are not subdivisions:
      (1)   Division of a parcel into two or more parcels, all of which are
five acres or more, not involving new streets (public or private) or easements
of access.
      (2)   Sale or exchange of parcels between adjoining land owners, if no
additional building sites are created.
      (3)   Transfer of an existing piece of land as a whole that has been
previously recorded by metes and bounds description.
      (4)   Normally the transfer of a lot that is recorded as a lot in a major
subdivision.  The transfer of a part of such lot will not be a subdivision
unless it is less than five acres and involves new streets (public or private)
or easements of access or unless it creates additional building sites and is
not a sale or exchange between adjoining land owners.
 
   The land to be divided is a subdivision - then the owners will have to
proceed with formal platting requirements, Section
1115.03, unless the division of land meets the minor subdivision category
Section
1115.02 (Ohio R.C. 711.131).
   If the minor subdivision criteria are met - no plat is required and the
conveyance (deed) shall be stamped "Approved - No Plat Required" a drawing may
be required.  These Regulations provide a simplified procedure.
   If the criteria for a minor subdivision are not met - Then the major
subdivision requirements must be followed - unless a hardship exists to qualify
for a variance.
 
   What is a Minor Subdivision?
   (a)   It is a division of land that:
      (1)   Must be a division of a parcel along an existing public street; and
      (2)   Must not involve the opening, widening or extension of any street
or road; and
      (3)   Must involve no more than five lots after the original tract has
been completely subdivided; and
      (4)   Must not be contrary to applicable platting, subdividing, or zoning
regulations.
      Ohio R.C. 711.131 regulations set forth other requirements to be met by a
minor subdivision.
 
   (b)   Keep these definitions in mind:
      (1)   The full definition of a minor subdivision (above).
      (2)   Original tract:  (based on O.A.G. Opinion 71-083)
         A.   A contiguous quantity of land held by one person- or in common
ownership - which has not been platted by the existing owner - this means:
            (1)   A tract can be original to one person and not to another.
            (2)   "Original" does not mean initial source.
            (3)   Permits subdivision through successive ownership.
 
   (c)   Completely subdivided:
      (1)   When a tract is divided into as many lots as that subdivider
intends for the tract.
      (2)   A specific subdivider may later decide to increase the number of
lots in a subdivision -- but to do so -- and assuming there are more than five
lots as a result, it would be necessary to replat the original tract.
      (3)   It is possible for a tract to be "completely subdivided" and then
be further subdivided by a party who purchases or takes title to a parcel in a
subdivision large enough to be divided.
 
   (d)   The Ohio Attorney General has concluded:
      (1)   Tract means a contiguous quantity of land undivided by lot lines.
      (2)   Original contemplates a tract which has not been divided under its
present ownership.
      (3)   Original tract means a continuous quantity of land held by one
person or in common, which has not been platted by the existing owner.
      (4)   The phrase "involving no more than five lots after the original
tract has been completely subdivided" applies only to the necessity for
replatting to accomplish changes in an already subdivided tract.

1140.10   Definitions.
   1140.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of the Campus District Corridor Overlay (CDCO) is to apply
standards designed for corridors that typically include a mix of pedestrian and
vehicle oriented development patterns, setbacks ranging from 15 to 50 feet, lot
widths of at least 50 feet, and commercial uses.
The overlay standards are intended to achieve the following objectives:
   (a)    Establish, reinforce and enhance the character and pedestrian-
oriented development patterns of quasi-urban commercial corridors;
   (b)    Implement appropriate building and parking setback standards that
accommodate redevelopment and establish continuity and consistency along the
corridors; and
   (c)    Promote development that features landscaping, façade transparency,
rear parking lots, user-friendly access, and appropriately scaled lighting and
signage.
   (d)    Intended to encourage pedestrian-oriented design typified by retail
display windows, reduced building setbacks, rear parking lots, and ornamental
walls and fences.
   Use of this overlay also serves as a means of implementing key policy
recommendations of neighborhood plans and design studies.
(Ord. 17-08.  Passed 4-19-17.)
   1140.02  OVERLAY AREAS.
   The boundaries of the Campus District Corridor Overlay areas are part of the
Official Zoning Map and shall be described in separate sections beginning with
Section
1140.03 and ending with Section
1140.10. For the purposes and requirements of a Campus District Overlay area
the term "primary street" means North Lexington Springmill Road from US 30 to
the North limits and Walker Lake Road from Spring Village Drive to the West
limits.

   (e)    Exterior alteration of a primary building frontage is subject to
applicable provisions of Section
1140.05, items (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i). For purposes of this
requirement, the placement of window shutters, fabric canopies and awnings and/
or building-mounted signage is not considered to be exterior alteration.
   (f)    The parking standards in Section
1140.09 apply to existing buildings, additions, and new construction.
   (g)    The construction or installation of a new parking lot, graphic,
exterior lighting, fence, or other accessory structure is subject to all the
applicable provisions herein. Overlay standards do not apply to the re-striping
or reconfiguration of existing parking lots.
   (h)    Routine maintenance and in-kind replacement of materials are exempt
from the graphics standards and requirements of this overlay and are subject to
Section
1146, on previously existing signage only.
   (i)    The standards contained in the overlay are in addition to the
regulations of the underlying zoning districts and the general requirements
contained in the Ontario Zoning Code. Where a specific overlay standard is
imposed, it is to be followed in lieu of a general provision of the Zoning
Code.  Where the overlay does not address a required standard and it is
otherwise contained in the Zoning Code, the Zoning Code standard shall be
followed. Except as conditioned by City Council, Planning Commission or the
Mayor, the provisions of this overlay are deemed more restrictive.
   (j)    The City will require full compliance for any new construction in the
overlay district.

All costs of the financial security shall be borne by the applicant.
         B.   Decommissioning of Wind Turbine Towers.  A Wind Turbine Tower
which is not used for twelve (12) successive months shall be deemed abandoned
and shall be dismantled and removed from the property at the expense of the
property owner.  Failure to abide and faithfully comply with this section or
with any and all conditions that may be attached to the granting of any zoning
permit shall constitute grounds for the revocation of the permit by the City.
      (13)   Transport of utility scale wind turbine towers.
         A.   Any person or firm proposing to transport any portion of an
Utility Scale Wind Turbine Tower shall submit a proposed route to the City

   (a)   Intent. 
      (1)   Within the districts established by this Ordinance or amendments
that may later be adopted, there exist lots, uses of land, structures, and uses
of structures and land in combination which were lawful before this Ordinance
was passed or its present amendments adopted, but which would be prohibited,
regulated or restricted under the terms of this Ordinance or amendments.       
      (2)   It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit these non-conformities
to continue until they are removed.  Non-conformities are declared by this
Ordinance to be incompatible with the permitted uses in the zoning districts in
which such use is located.
      (3)   The extension or enlargement of a non-conforming use of land or a
non- conforming use of a structure and land in combination shall require the
approval of the City Planning Commission.
      (4)   A non-conforming use that is consistent with the current zoning may
be substituted for an existing use. 
      (5)   Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in
plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual
construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Ordinance and upon which actual building construction has
been carried on in a diligent manner.                                         
                         
                                                           
   (b)   Single Non-conforming Lots of Record. 
      (1)   A one-family structure and customary accessory buildings may be
erected on a single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Ordinance where the lot of record fails to meet the minimum
lot area and width requirements, or both, generally applicable within the
zoning district. However, all principle buildings shall conform with the
minimum yard dimensions and setback requirements other than those applying to
lot area and width, or both, for the zoning district in which the lot is
located.
      (2)   No portion of any lot shall be used or sold in a manner which
diminishes compliance with lot area and width requirements established for the
zoning district in which the lot is located.
      (3)   Variations from the requirements of this Ordinance, other than the
required lot area and width, shall be obtained only through action by the City 
Planning Commission as provided in Section
1151.04, “Duties.”
   (c)   Nonconforming Uses of Land.  Where lawful uses of land exist which
would not be permitted by this Ordinance, the uses may be continued so long as
they remain otherwise lawful, provided:
      (1)   The enlargement, increase, or extension of a non-conforming use
shall be obtained only through action of the City Planning Commission as
provided in Section
1151.04.  The Planning Commission shall recognize a one-time request for
enlarging, increasing or extending a non-conforming use a maximum of ten
percent (10%).
      (2)   No such non-conforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to
any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the
effective date of the adoption or amendment of this Ordinance;
      (3)   If any non-conforming use of land is discontinued or abandoned for
more than one (1) year, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the
regulations specified by this Ordinance for the zoning district in which such
land is located. 
   (d)   Non-conforming Structures.  Where a lawful building or structure
exists at the effective date of the adoption or amendment of this Ordinance,
that would not be allowed in the zoning district under the terms of this
Ordinance, such building or structure may be continued providing it remains
lawful, subject to the following requirements:
      (1)   The enlargement, increase, or extension of an existing non-
conforming structure shall require the approval of the City Planning
Commission.
      (2)   Should a non-conforming structure or non-conforming portion of a
structure be accidentally destroyed, it may be reconstructed as it existed
before destruction provided the reconstruction shall begin within one (1) year
and is completed within two (2) years.  Such reconstruction shall not result in
a larger structure than existed before such destruction.
      (3)   Should a non-conforming structure be moved for any reason for any
distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the
zoning district in which it is located after it is moved.
      (4)   An accessory building or structure not conforming to the
requirements of this Ordinance shall be declared as a non-conforming structure.
   (e)   Non-conforming Uses of Structure and Land in Combination.  Where a
lawful use involving a structure and land in combination exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance that would not be
permitted in the zoning district under the terms of this Ordinance, such lawful
use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following requirements:
      (1)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this
Ordinance for the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, increased,
or extended except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in
the zoning district in which it is located;
      (2)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout the parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building;
      (3)   Any structure and land in combination, in or on which a non-
conforming use is superseded by a permitted use for a period of one (1) year,
shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is
located, and the non-conforming use may not thereafter be resumed; 
      (4)   When a non-conforming use of a structure, or structure and land in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for more than one (1) year, the
structure or structure and land in combination shall not thereafter be used
except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is
located;
      (5)    Where non-conforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the non-
conforming status of the land.
      (6)   Work may be conducted on ordinary repairs, or on repair or
replacement of walls, fixtures, wiring, heating or plumbing on any non-
conforming structure or portion of a structure containing a non-conforming use,
provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not
be increased. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof
declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public
safety, upon order of such official.

specifications approved by the City Engineer and shall be completed within
eighteen (18) months after the Zoning Permit issuance under which the
construction was begun.
      (2)   Off-street parking lots shall be constructed in such a manner so as
to dispose of all surface water accumulated in the parking lot in such a way to
preclude draining water onto adjacent properties and eliminating standing
water.
   (c)   Lighting.  The cone of light used to illuminate any off-street parking
lot shall shine directly onto the parking lot only.  (Ord. 03-15. Passed 3-6-
03.)

   Every building, structure, or part thereof, involving the receipt or
distribution of vehicles, materials or merchandise shall provide and maintain
on the lot, adequate space for the storage, loading or unloading of motor
vehicles in order to avoid undue interference with the public use of dedicated
rights-of-way.  Standing, loading and unloading spaces shall be provided as
follows:

   (d)   No part of any required off-street parking area, access drive, street
or public right-of-way shall be used for loading or unloading purposes.
   
   (e)    No loading or unloading location shall face, or run parallel with, a
street right-of-way unless the Zoning Inspector determines that the location
minimizes the impact on the business or adjoining properties.
   
   (f)    Off-street loading and unloading shall be provided in addition to,
and not considered as meeting a part of, the requirements for off-street
parking spaces as set forth in Sections
1145.18 and

improved traffic conditions, and to prescribe necessary project-specific
mitigation measures or to otherwise require a traffic impact analysis as a part
of the site plan approval process.
      (2)   It is further the intent of this Section to ensure that traffic
impact analysis plan approvals are granted where traffic mitigation
improvements will maintain or improve the service level of a street which is
currently operating at or below the traffic service goals established for the
City; and better coordinate the type, location, amount, timing and rate of
proposed land use development according to the Master Plan and Zoning
Ordinance, with the present and projected capacity of the City street system.
                                                                 
   (b)   Traffic Impact Analysis Review.  The applicant shall conduct a review
of the traffic impact analysis for any proposed development in conjunction with
the review of the site plan.  If the City Planning Commission finds that the
proposed development would not cause traffic service levels to be exceeded at
any intersections that are critical to the development, the review
will be approved.  To ensure that traffic service levels of a proposed
development shall not exceed the service levels at any intersection or driveway
approach the City Planning Commission may request the Richland County
Transportation Coordinating Committee to prepare traffic mitigation
recommendations citing the measures to be implemented to accomplish the traffic
service level goals adopted for the street or highway.  The mitigation program
shall cite how the applicant will eliminate the adverse traffic impacts and how
the traffic service level goals will be achieved.

   1146.03  SIGNS BY NUMBER, SIZE AND LOCATION.
   (a)     Methods That Control the Computations of Sign Area and Height.
      (1)    Area computation for individual signs. The area of the face of a
sign shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle,
triangle, or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the
sign, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the
background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the back drop
or structure against which it is placed.  Any supporting framework, bracing, or
decorative fence or wall when clearly incidental to the display shall not be
computed as part of the total sign face.
      (2)    Area computation of multi-faced signs. The sign area for a sign
with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all
sign faces visible from one point. When two identical sign faces are placed
back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any one point at the
same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are
not more than forty two inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the
measurement of one face.
      (3)   Area computation by spherical signs. The sphere shall be bisected
by an imaginary plane through the center of the sphere and the surface area of
the half-sphere shall be counted as the sign face.
      (4)   Computation of height.  The height of a sign shall be computed as
the distance from the base of the sign at average grade to the top of the
highest attached component of the sign.
   (b)    Methods That Control the Number and Location of Signs.
(1)   The City has determined that the use of land is a significant factor in
determining the size, number, and location of signs.
(2)   Signs placed in residential areas are of particular consideration to the
purposes of this Chapter in promoting the public health, safety, and welfare
through establishing standards for signs. The following characteristics of
residential areas, including, but not limited to, homes with parking on
streets, numerous access points onto streets via driveways, school crossings
and bus stops, children playing in yards and at local parks, increased
pedestrian traffic, limited sidewalks, and other community activities highlight
the importance of standards about the type, design, size, location,
illumination, enforcement, and maintenance of signs to:
         A.   Reduce the hazards to motorists and pedestrians from the
distraction and obstruction that may be caused by unsafe signs, or an excessive
proliferation of signs; and,
         B.   Enhance and protect the quality of all land uses, property
values, and aesthetics of the community.
      (3)   Considerations pertaining to the safety of motorists and
pedestrians traveling in commercial and industrial areas, such as ensuring
readability of signs, permit more variation in the type, design, size,
location, and illumination of signs. 
   (c)    The Following Signs Are Permissible Without a Permit and Under the
Following Criteria for All Zoning Districts.
   NOTE: Signs (1) to (6) require a minimum set back of 10 feet from the right
of way.  (Ord. 08-18.  Passed 5-15-08.)

                             Original permit must be approved by planning commission at a regularly scheduled
                             meeting. Once approved by planning commission, there would be a onetime fee. Once
                             fees are paid, this permit will stay in effect until there is a change of
                             ownership or the facility closes.
                             Signs located within the seventy five foot (75') setback from right-of-way or
                             closest to the road will still have to go through the sign plan process, area fee
                             and variance if required. These signs would need to meet current zoning codes.
                             Signs located behind the seventy five (75') setback from right-of-way will have a
                             set fee of $2500.00 for signs to be installed. This will include all sign
                             permits, area fees and there would be no variances required.
(10) Hospital Signage        The sizes of the signs located behind the seventy five (75') setback from right-
                             of-way will be determined by the "hospital" as needed.
                             Note: the City Zoning Inspector still reserves the right to ask that the sign be
                             smaller than proposed if the sign would be a safety concern.
                             All signs behind the seventy five (75') setback from right-of-way would still
                             have to go through the sign permit process for approval by the Zoning Inspector,
                             there would not be an extra permit fee, area fee or variance required for these
                             signs.
                             All signs installed behind the seventy five foot (75') setback from right-of-way

                             Department.
                             This ordinance will not be retroactive for any sign fees that have been paid in
                             the past.

   1301.01  ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, effective January 1, 2016, and as
identified and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio Administrative
Code (OAC).
   1301.02  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units.  Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance.  Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use.  Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization.  To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and

   1345.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution
grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and control
measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens.
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The City of Ontario has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and  generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Ontario as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional areas
of special flood hazard annexed by the City of Ontario.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. 
      (1)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
         A.   Flood Insurance Study Richland County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas, and Flood Insurance Rate Map Richland County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas, both effective April 4, 2011.
         B.   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard,
include: City of Ontario Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan 2009-2014;
Rainfall Frequency Atlas of the Midwest (current edition).
         C.   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Ontario as required by Section
1345.04(c).
      (2)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the City of Ontario Service Building, 3375
Milligan Road, Room 112, Ontario, Ohio  44906.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Ontario, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.  (Ord. 11-
03.  Passed 2-3-11.)
   1345.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure:  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal:  A request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.

exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE):  The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement:  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.

   (i)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management):  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (j)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA):  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (k)   Fill:  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (l)   Flood or Flooding:  A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (m)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM):  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM):  An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones:  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (p)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS):  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (q)   Flood Protection Elevation:  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus two (2) feet of freeboard. In areas where no
base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (r)   Floodway:
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (s)   Freeboard:  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (t)   Historic structure:  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the City of Ontario's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (u)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis:  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (v)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC):  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA):  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR):  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR):  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (w)   Lowest floor:  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (x)   Manufactured home:  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (y)   Manufactured home park:  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (z)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (aa)   New construction:  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Ontario's Flood
Damage Reduction Regulations, April 5, 1974, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (bb)   Person:  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (cc)   Recreational vehicle:  A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Architect:  A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Engineer:  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Registered Professional Surveyor:  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (gg)   Special Flood Hazard Area:  Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (hh)   Start of construction:  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (ii)   Structure:  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (jj)   Substantial Damage:  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (kk)   Substantial Improvement:  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (ll)   Variance:  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (mm)   Violation:  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section

by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1345.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Ontario, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Ontario have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Ontario's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
Ontario's boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
City of Ontario suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the City of Ontario has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1345.05.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. 
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point.  Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1345.04(i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
"bankfull stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field

Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of Ontario specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1345.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
the office of the Clerk of Council at the Ontario Municipal Building, 555
Stumbo Road Ontario, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1345.05(d).
   (c)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within ten (10) days of the date of such notice and order, or other
official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the
mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's
decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be
filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the
Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent
information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the
Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing.  The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing. 
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1345.05(d)(3)A.1. to 11. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Richland County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.  (Ord. 11-03.  Passed 2-3-
11.)
   1345.06  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance Required.
      (1)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered

applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1345.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
Section
1345.06(c).
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with Section
1345.06(c).
   (b)   Notice of Violation.  Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines
that there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall
give notice of such violation to the person responsible therefore and order
compliance with these regulations as hereinafter provided. Such notice and
order shall:
      (1)   Be put in writing on an appropriate form;
      (2)   Include a list of violations, referring to the section or sections
of these regulations that have been violated, and order remedial action, which,

      (3)   Specify a reasonable time for performance;
      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;

or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties.  Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a fourth degree
misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
provided by the laws of the City of Ontario. Each day such violation continues
shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent
the City of Ontario from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to
prevent or remedy any violation. The City of Ontario shall prosecute any

(Ord. 16-40.  Passed 12-7-16.)
   1353.09  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls.  The
SWP3 must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization).
   The approved SWP3, and the sediment and erosion controls, and non-sediment
pollution controls contained therein, shall be implemented upon the
commencement of construction.  Perimeter controls must be installed two working
days prior to commencement of construction.  The approved plan must be
implemented until the site reaches final stabilization.  All properties
adjacent to the site of soil-disturbing activity shall be protected from soil
erosion and sediment run-off and damage, including, but not limited to, private
properties, natural and artificial waterways, wetlands, storm sewers and public
lands.
   It is the owner's responsibility to maintain current records of contractor
(s) responsible for implementation of the SWP3 and providing that information
to the city engineer or zoning inspector. The SWP3 shall identify all
subcontractors engaged in activities that could impact stormwater runoff.  The
SWP3 shall contain signatures from all of the identified subcontractors
indicating that they have been informed and understand their roles and
responsibilities in complying with the SWP3.
   Erosion and sediment controls shall be designed, installed and maintained
effectively to minimize the discharge of pollutants during the course of earth
disturbing activities.  The controls shall include the following minimum
components:
   (a)   Non-structural Preservation Measures: The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable.  Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
minimizing disturbance of steep slopes, designation of tree preservation areas
or other protective clearing or grubbing practices. Soil compaction shall be
minimized and, unless infeasible, topsoil shall be preserved. Provide and
maintain a 50-foot buffer of undisturbed natural vegetation around surface
waters of the state, or riparian or wetland setbacks, if applicable, whichever
is greater, unless maintaining this buffer is infeasible (e.g., stream
crossings for roads or utilities, or for channel and floodplain rehabilitation
and restoration).  Direct stormwater to vegetated areas to increase sediment
removal and maximize stormwater infiltration. 
   (b)   Erosion Control Practices: The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils.  The amount of soil
exposed during construction activity shall be minimized.  A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3.  The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year.  Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover. 
      Erosion control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization.  Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.
Table 1: Permanent Stabilization

Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization
techniques must be employed.
 
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels.  Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)   Runoff Control Practices.  The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff within the site to prevent
erosion.  Peak flow rates and total stormwater volume shall be controlled to
minimize erosion and outlets, downstream channel and streambank erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices.  These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.  Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge
locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-erosive
flow velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural physical
and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and protected.
   (d)   Sediment Control Practices.  The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas to minimize sediment discharges from
the site.  Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more than 14 days.  Such practices
may include, among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain
inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to
a sediment settling pond.  The design, installation and maintenance of erosion
and sediment controls shall address factors such as the amount, frequency,
intensity and duration of precipitation, the nature of resulting stormwater
runoff, and soil characteristics, including the range of soil particle sizes
expected to be present on the site.
   (e)   All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional.  Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are
not considered a sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a
sediment settling pond.
Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing.  They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized.  As construction progresses and the
topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing
controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds. A sediment settling pond, or equivalent
best management practice upon approval from the City of Ontario Engineer, is
required for any one of the following conditions:
         A.   Concentrated stormwater runoff.
         B.   Runoff from drainage areas which exceeds the design capacity of
silt fence (see Table 3) inlet protection, or other sediment barriers;
         C.   Runoff from common drainage locations with 10 or more acres of
disturbed land.
Sediment settling ponds shall be provided in the form of a sediment trap or
sediment basin as defined in the latest edition of Rainwater and Land
Development.  The maximum allowable contributing drainage area to a sediment
trap shall be limited to less than 5 acres.  Contributing drainage areas of 5
acres or more shall be treated with a sediment basin.  An equivalent best
management practice may be utilized upon approval from the City of Ontario. 
The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage zone and a
dewatering zone.  The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at least 1,800
cubic feet of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area.  The
dewatering structure of sediment basins shall be designed to have a minimum 48-
hour drain time, and, unless infeasible, be designed to always withdraw runoff
from the surface of the pond throughout the storm cycle.  As such, a skimmer
discharge device consistent with Rainwater and Land Development shall be
provided to dewater sediment basins. Sediment traps shall also provide both a
sediment storage zone and dewatering zone, but the outlet structure shall be
constructed consistent with the specifications contained in the latest edition
of Rainwater and Land Development.
When post-construction detention/water quality ponds are to be used as
temporary sediment trapping BMPs, a skimmer discharge device consistent with
Rainwater and Land Development shall be utilized during construction phase and
until the site is deemed permanently stabilized by the city engineer.
The skimmer shall be designed per the equivalent requirements of sediment
basins and the operator must ensure that the outlet structure of the pond
provides an equivalent or better sediment storage zone and dewatering zone.  As
such, temporarily while the site is under construction, there shall be no
discharge of runoff below the elevation required for the sediment storage zone
and the discharge of stormwater within the dewatering zone shall only occur
through the skimmer.
The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by one of the
following methods: 
Method 1:   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be 1000ft3 per
disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
Method 2:   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the volume
necessary to store the sediment as calculated with RUSLE or other generally
accepted erosion prediction model.
When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and areas
which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless
runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment settling pond and is
not co-mingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the dewatering zone
must be less than or equal to five (5) feet.  The configuration between the
inlets and the outlet of the sediment-settling pond must provide at least two
units of length for each one unit of width ? 2:1 length-to-width ratio;
however, a length to width ratio of ? 4:1 is recommended.  Sediment must be
removed from the sediment-settling pond when the design capacity of the
sediment storage zone has been completely filled by sediment accumulations. 
This limit is typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin
depth.  When designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must consider
public safety, especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for the
sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design.  The use of a combination of sediment
and erosion control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is
encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions.  Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent properties
and water resources from sediment transported via sheet flow.  Where intended
to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on a level contour and
shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff.  The relationship between the
maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular slope range is shown in
Table 3 below.  Placing silt fence in a parallel series does not extend the
size of the permissible drainage area.
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence Based on Slope
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 Range of slope for a drainage area (%)
linear feet of silt fence
0.5                                  <2%
0.25                                 > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                > 20% but < 50%
      (4)   Alternative perimeter controls for sheet flow discharges may be
considered by the City of Ontario, but their use shall not exceed the
limitations indicated in Table 3 above.  Detail drawings and plan notes shall
specify the diameter of filter socks, compost berms and other such alternative
perimeter controls if used instead of silt fence.
      (5)   Stormwater diversion practices shall be used to keep runoff away
from disturbed areas and steep slopes.  Such devices, which include swales,
dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to 10 acres.
      (6)   Inlet protection.  Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems.  All inlets receiving runoff from drainage
areas of one or more acres will require a sediment settling pond.  Straw or hay
bales and filter socks around catch basins are not acceptable forms of inlet
protection.
      (7)   Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control.  Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled.  These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area.  These
entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled
concrete or cement sized greater than 2" in diameter, placed over a geotextile
fabric, and constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent
edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   Streets and catch basins adjacent to construction entrances shall
be kept free of sediment tracked off site.  Streets directly adjacent to
construction entrances and receiving traffic from the development area, shall
be cleaned daily to remove sediment tracked off-site.  If applicable, the catch
basins on these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall also be
cleaned weekly and protected from sediment-laden runoff, if feasible without
posing a public safety hazard.
         C.   Based on site conditions, city engineer may require additional
best management practices to control off site tracking and dust.  These
additional BMPs may include:
         D.   Fencing shall be installed around the perimeter of the
development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to designated
construction entrances.
         E.   Designated vehicle and wheel-washing areas.  Wash water from
these areas must be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-
settling pond, or to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
1353.09(g)of this regulation.  No surfactants or detergents may be used to wash
vehicles.
         F.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions.  The city engineer may require dust
controls including the use of water trucks to wet disturbed areas, tarping
stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed areas, and regulation of the
speed of vehicles on the site.
      (8)   Surface Waters of the State protection.  Construction vehicles
shall avoid water resources.  A 50 foot undisturbed natural buffer shall be
provided around surface waters of the state unless infeasible.  If it is
infeasible to provide and maintain an undisturbed 50-foot natural buffer, the
SWP3 shall comply with the stabilization requirements in Section
1353.09(b)(1) for areas within 50 feet of a surface water or riparian or
wetland setbacks, whichever is greater; and minimize soil compaction and,
unless infeasible, preserve topsoil. If the applicant is permitted to disturb
areas within 50 feet of a water resource, the following conditions shall be
addressed in the SWP3:
         A.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in water resources
or wetlands.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
         G.   Concentrated stormwater runoff from BMPs to natural wetlands
shall be converted to diffuse flow through the use of level spreaders or other
such appropriate measure before the runoff enters the wetlands.  The flow
should be released such that no erosion occurs downslope.  Level spreaders may
need to be placed in series to ensure non-erosive velocities.
      (9)   Modifying controls.  If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions. 
   (f)   Non-sediment Pollutant Controls:  No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in stormwater runoff.  The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources, wetlands or
the MS4.  These practices shall include but are not limited to the following: 
      (1)   Waste Materials: A covered dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      (2)   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, other public facility, natural resource or water of the
state is prohibited.  A designated area for concrete washout shall be made
available. 
      (3)   Disposal of Other Wastewaters:  The discharge of washout and
cleanout of stucco, paint, form release oils, curing compounds, and other
construction materials to a street, catch basin, other public facility, natural
resource or waters of the state is prohibited.  The discharge of soaps or
solvents used in vehicle and equipment washing is also prohibited. If
generated, these wastewaters must be collected and disposed of properly.
      (4)   Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area.  A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of the largest
containers in the storage area and/or a spill kit shall be provided to clean up
spills.  The SWP3 shall contain spill prevention and response procedures and
these procedures shall be discussed at the pre-construction meeting. 
      (5)   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.  The discharge of fuels, oils, and other
pollutants used in vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance is
prohibited.
      (6)   Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff: Discovery of previously
unknown contaminated soils onsite shall be self-reported to Ohio EPA and local
authorities.  Contaminated soils from redevelopment sites shall be disposed of
properly.  Runoff from contaminated soils shall not be discharged from the
site.  Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on solid waste
landfill sites or redevelopment sites.  Where construction activities are to
occur on sites with contamination from previous activities, operators shall be
aware that concentrations of materials that meet other criteria (i.e. not
considered a Hazardous Waste, meeting Voluntary Action Program (VAP standards))
may still result in stormwater discharges in excess of Ohio Water Quality
Standards.  Such discharges are not authorized by this code. Control measures
which may be utilized to meet this requirement include, but are not limited to:
 
         A.   Use berms, trenches, pits or tanks to collect contaminated runoff
and prevent discharge.
         B.   Pump runoff from contaminated soils to the sanitary sewer with
the prior approval of the sanitary sewer system operator, or pump into a
container for transport to an appropriate treatment or disposal facility; and
         C.   Cover areas of contamination with tarps, daily cover or other
such methods to prevent storm water from coming into contact with contaminated
materials.
The SWP3 must include methods to minimize the exposure of building materials,
building products, construction wastes, trash, landscape materials,
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, and sanitary waste to
precipitation, stormwater runoff, and snow melt. The SWP3 shall include
measures to prevent and respond to chemical spills and leaks. Applicants may
also reference the existence of other plans (i.e., Spill Prevention Control and
Countermeasure (SPCC) plans, spill control programs, Safety Response Plans,
etc.) provided that such plan addresses this requirement and a copy of such
plan is maintained on site. 
   (g)   Compliance with Other Requirements.  The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (h)   Trench and Ground Water Control. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities.  If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through
a sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site.  Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice.  Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge. 
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (i)   Internal Inspections.  All controls on the site shall be inspected at
least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event
greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The inspection frequency
may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire site is temporarily
stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions (e.g., site is
covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of inspection
requirements is available until one month before thawing conditions are
expected to result in a discharge if prior written approval has been attained
from the city engineer and all of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one (1)
month).
      (2)   Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
stabilization is achieved.
      (3)   The beginning date and ending dates of the waiver period are
documented in the SWP3.
The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these
inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional and to evaluate
whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures are
required.  Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and
experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion
controls.
        These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system. 
      (2)   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall
be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly.  The applicant shall
utilize an inspection form provided by the City of Ontario or an alternate form
acceptable to the city engineer.  The inspection form shall include:
         A.   The inspection date.
         B.   Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
         C.   Weather information for the period since the last inspection,
including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event, duration of
each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event in
inches, and whether any discharges occurred.
         D.   Weather information and a description of any discharges occurring
at the time of inspection.
      E.   Locations of:
            1.   Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
            2.   BMPs that need to be maintained.
            3.   BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved inadequate
for a particular location.
            4.   Where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the
time of inspection.
         F.   Corrective action required including any necessary changes to the
SWP3 and implementation dates.
            1.   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether
erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant
impacts to the receiving water resource or wetlands. 
            2.   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be
inspected for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
            3.   The applicant shall maintain for three (3) years following
final stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and
qualifications of personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections,
major observations relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification
as to whether the facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on
any incidents of non-compliance determined by these inspections.
     (j)   Maintenance.  The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements.  All BMPs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to ensure
continued performance of their intended function until final stabilization. 
All sediment control practices must be maintained in a functional condition
until all up slope areas they control reach final stabilization.  The applicant
shall provide a description of maintenance procedures needed to ensure the
continued performance of control practices and shall ensure a responsible party
and adequate funding to conduct this maintenance, all as determined by the city
engineer.
   (k)   When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or
installation of erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures
shall be followed:
      (1)   When BMPs require repair or maintenance.  If an internal inspection
reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the exception of a
sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within three (3) days
of the inspection.  Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or maintained
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (2)   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function.  If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function as
detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be
installed within three (3) to ten (10) days of the inspection as determined by
the city engineer or site inspector.
      (3)   When BMPs depicted on the SWP3 are not installed.  If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in accordance with the
schedule, the control practice must be implemented within ten (10) days from
the date of the inspection.  If the internal inspection reveals that the
planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement of
explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
   (l)   Final Stablization. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
city engineer.  Once a definable area has achieved final stabilization, the
applicant may note this on the SWP3 and no further inspection requirement
applies to that portion of the site.  Final stabilization also requires the
installation of permanent (post-construction) stormwater control measures
(SCMs).  Obligations under this ordinance shall not be completed until
installation of post-construction BMPs is verified.

boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems, including rear yard inlets. Straw, hay
bales, and filter socks  are not acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (6)   Silt Fence and Other Perimeter Controls.  Silt fence and other
perimeter controls approved by the City of Ontario shall be used to protect
adjacent properties and water resources from sediment discharged via sheet
(diffused) flow.  Silt fence shall be placed along level contours and the
permissible drainage area is limited to those indicated in Table 3 in
1353.09 of these regulations.
      (7)   Internal Inspection and Maintenance.  All controls on the
development area shall be inspected at least once every seven calendar days and
within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24
hour period.  Maintenance shall occur as detailed below:
         A.   When BMPs require repair or maintenance.  If the internal
inspection reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three (3) days of the inspection.  Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         B.   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function.  If the
internal inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function
and that another, more appropriate control practice is required, the
Abbreviated SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be installed
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         C.   When BMPs depicted on the Abbreviated SWP3 are not installed.  If
the internal inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection.  If the inspection reveals that
the planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement
of explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.

   1354.01  RIPARIAN SETBACK REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   It is hereby determined that the system of wetlands, riparian areas,
rivers, streams, and other natural watercourses within the Community
contributes to the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents. The
specific purpose and intent of this part of these regulations is to regulate
future uses and developments within riparian and wetland setbacks that would
impair the ability of riparian and wetland areas to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of floodwaters, and regulating base flow.
      (2)   Assist in stabilizing the banks of watercourses to reduce bank
erosion and the downstream transport of sediments eroded from watercourse
banks.
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling, and transforming pollutants already present in
watercourses.
      (4)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses by filtering, settling, and
transforming pollutants in runoff before they enter watercourses.
      (5)   Provide watercourse habitats with shade and food.
      (6)   Provide habitat to a wide array of aquatic organisms and wildlife
by maintaining diverse and connected riparian and wetland vegetation.
   (b)   The following regulations have been enacted to protect these services
of riparian and wetland areas by providing reasonable controls governing the
construction or expansion of structures and changes to the uses within a
wetland and/or riparian setback along designated watercourses in the City.
   (c)   Applicability and Compliance:
      (1)   These regulations shall apply to all lands that are within the
jurisdiction of the City and that border designated watercourses and wetlands
as defined in these regulations.
      (2)   The City shall issue no approvals or permits without full
compliance with the terms of these regulations.
   (d)   Violation:  Any person who violates any section of these regulations
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree and, upon conviction
thereof, shall be subject to punishment as provided in Section
937.99, and shall be required to restore the riparian and/or wetland setback
through a restoration plan approved by the City.
(Ord. 16-38.  Passed 12-7-16.)
   1354.02  ESTABLISHMENT OF DESIGNATED WATERCOURSES AND RIPARIAN SETBACKS.
   (a)   Designated watercourses shall include those watercourses meeting any
one of the following criteria:
      (1)   All watercourses draining an area greater than 1/2 square mile, or
      (2)   All watercourses draining an area less than 1/2 square mile and
having a defined bed and bank.
      (3)   In determining if watercourses have a defined bed and bank, the
City may consult with a representative of the local county SWCD or other
technical experts as necessary.
   (b)   Riparian setbacks on designated watercourses are established as
follows:
      (1)   A minimum of 25 feet on both sides of all watercourses draining an
area greater than one half square mile and up to and including 20 square miles.
      (2)   A minimum of 25 feet on both sides of all watercourses draining an
area less than one half square mile and having a defined bed and bank as
determined above.
   (c)   Riparian Setback Map:
      (1)   The City shall identify designated water courses and their riparian
setbacks.
      (2)   At the time of application of this regulation, if any discrepancy
is found between the Riparian Setback Map and the criteria for designated
watercourses or riparian setbacks as set forth in these regulations, the
criteria shall prevail.
      (3)   In reviewing and interpreting the maps and designating watercourses
the City may consult with a representative of the local county SWCD and other
technical experts as necessary.
   (d)   The following conditions shall apply in riparian and wetland setbacks:
      (1)   Riparian and wetland setbacks shall be measured in a perpendicular
and horizontal direction outward from the ordinary high water mark of each
designated watercourse and defined wetland boundary.
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided in this regulation, riparian and
wetland setbacks shall be preserved in their natural state and shall be
established prior to any soil disturbing or land clearing activities.
      (3)   Where the 100-year floodplain is wider than a riparian setback on
either or both sides of a designated watercourse, the riparian setback shall be
extended to the outer edge of the 100-year floodplain. The 100-year floodplain
shall be determined by the project engineer conducting a hydrologic analysis of
the project area in conformance with standard engineering practices and
approved by the City Engineer.
      (4)   Where wetlands are identified within a riparian setback, the
minimum riparian setback width shall be extended to the outer boundary of the
wetland. In addition, wetlands shall be protected to the extent detailed in
these regulations.
      (5)   Wetlands shall be delineated by a site survey approved by the City
using delineation protocols accepted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and
the Ohio EPA at the time of application of this regulation. If a conflict
exists between the delineation protocols of these two agencies, the delineation
protocol that results in the most inclusive area of wetland shall apply.
   (e)   The applicant or their designated representative shall be responsible
for delineating riparian and wetland setbacks, including any expansions or
modifications as required by these regulations, and identifying these setbacks
on all subdivisions, land development plans, and/or building permit
applications submitted to the City. This delineation may be done by a metes and
bounds survey and shall be subject to review and approval by the City. As a
result of this review, the City may consult with a representative of the local
county SWCD or other technical experts as necessary.
   (f)   Prior to any soil-disturbing activity, riparian and wetland setbacks
shall be clearly delineated on site by the applicant or their designated
representative, and such delineation shall be maintained throughout soil
disturbing activities.
   (g)   No approvals or permits shall be issued by the City prior to on-site
delineation of riparian and wetland setbacks in conformance with these
regulations.
   (h)   Upon completion of an approved subdivision, land development, or other
improvement, riparian and wetland setbacks shall be permanently recorded on the
plat records of the City. 
(Ord. 16-38.  Passed 12-7-16.)

      (2)   Stream Bank Stabilization and Erosion Control Measures. Stream bank
stabilization and erosion control measures designed to protect existing
structures or uses may be allowed provided that such measures are ecologically
compatible and substantially utilize natural materials and native plant species
where practical. The stream bank stabilization and erosion control measures
shall only be undertaken upon approval of an Erosion and Sediment Control Plan
by the City.
      (3)   Crossings of designated watercourses and through riparian setbacks
by publicly and privately owned sewer and/or water lines and public and private
utility transmission lines shall only be allowed upon approval of a Crossing
Plan by the City Engineer. Such crossings shall minimize disturbance in
riparian setbacks and shall mitigate any necessary disturbances.
(Ord. 16-38.  Passed 12-7-16.)
   1354.04  USES PROHIBITED IN RIPARIAN SETBACKS.

   1354.06  VARIANCES WITHIN RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACKS.
   (a)   The City may grant a variance from this regulation as provided herein.
In determining whether there is unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty
such as to justify the granting of a variance, the City shall consider the
potential harm or reduction in riparian area functions that may be caused by a
proposed structure or use.
   (b)   In making a variance determination, the Community may consider the
following:
      (1)   The soil type and natural vegetation of the parcel, as well as the
percentage of the parcel that is in the 100-year floodplain. The criteria of
the City's flood damage prevention regulations may be used as guidance when
granting variances in the 100-year floodplain.
      (2)   The extent to which the requested variance impairs the flood
control, erosion control, sediment control, water quality protection, or other
functions of the riparian and/or wetland area. This determination shall be
based on sufficient technical and scientific data.
      (3)   The degree of hardship this regulation places on the landowner, and
the availability of alternatives to the proposed activity.
      (4)   Soil disturbing activities permitted in a riparian setback through
variances should be implemented in order to minimize clearing to the extent
possible, and to include Best Management Practices necessary to minimize
erosion and maximize sediment control.
      (5)   The presence of significant impervious cover, or smooth vegetation
such as maintained lawns, in riparian setback areas compromises their benefits
to the City.
      (6)   Variances should not be granted for asphalt or concrete paving in
the riparian setbacks.  Variances may be granted for gravel driveways in
riparian setbacks when necessary.
      (7)   A parcel existing at the time of passage of this chapter is made
unbuildable.
      (8)   Varying the front, rear and side yard setback before the riparian
and wetland setbacks are varied.

   1354.07  BOUNDARY INTERPRETATION AND APPEALS PROCEDURE.
   (a)   When an applicant or their designated representative disputes the
boundary of a riparian setback or the ordinary high water mark of a
watercourse, the applicant or their designated representative shall submit
documentation to the City which describes the boundary, the applicant's or
their designated representative's proposed boundary, and justification for the
proposed boundary change.
   (b)   The City shall evaluate this documentation and shall make a written
determination within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed sixty (60)
days, a copy of which shall be submitted to the applicant or their designated
representative. If during this evaluation the City requires further
information, it may require this be provided by the applicant or their
designated representative. In the event that the City requests such additional
information, the sixty (60) day limit on the City's review shall be postponed
until such information is provided by the applicant or their designated
representative.
   (c)   Any party aggrieved by any riparian setback determination under this
regulation may appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 16-38.  Passed 12-7-16.)
   1354.08  INSPECTION OF RIPARIAN SETBACK.
   (a)   The delineation of riparian and/or wetland setbacks may be inspected
by the City, as follows:
      (1)   Inspections may occur be prior to any soil disturbing activities
authorized by the City under a subdivision, land development plan, and/or
building permit. The applicant or their designated representative shall provide
the City with at least five (5) working days notice prior to starting soil
disturbing or land clearing activities.
      (2)   Any time evidence is brought to the attention of the City that uses
or structures are occurring that may reasonably be expected to violate the
provisions of these regulations.
