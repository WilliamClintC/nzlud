236.05  FISCAL AND MUNICIPAL YEARS.
   The fiscal year for the City shall commence on August 1 in each year insofar
as revenue, fiscal management and liability are concerned. The Municipal year
shall begin on the first meeting of December in each year insofar as
organization and legislation are concerned.
236.06  ANNUAL APPROPRIATION BILL.
   Within the last quarter of each fiscal year, the Mayor and Council shall
pass, approve, record and publish an ordinance to be termed the annual
appropriation bill, in which such corporate authorities may appropriate such
sums of money as may be deemed necessary to defray all necessary expenses and
liabilities of the City, not exceeding in the aggregate the amount of tax
authorized to be levied and revenue available during the then ensuing year. In
such ordinance, the Mayor and Council shall specify the objects and purposes
for which such appropriations are made and the amount appropriated for each
object or purpose. No further appropriation shall be made at any other time
within such fiscal year unless the proposition to make such appropriation has
been first sanctioned by a majority of the legal voters of the City either by
petition signed by them or at a general or special election duly called
therefor. All appropriations shall end with the fiscal year for which they are
made. However, the fund from road taxes shall be deemed especially appropriated
for street repair purposes, and the income arising from the operation of water,
lighting, power and sewerage systems shall be deemed especially appropriated to
the payment of current expenses for improvements, extensions and additions to
such systems respectively, and shall not be included in the annual
appropriation ordinance. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to
prohibit Council from appropriating other money in the annual appropriation
bill for the use of streets, grades, bridges and water, lighting, power,
heating and sewerage systems, provided that the sums so appropriated in the
aggregate do not exceed the maximum of tax allowed to be levied and collected
as fixed in Section 16-702, Revised Statutes of Nebraska, 1943, Reissue of
1974, as amended.
(1958 Code § 2.7)
236.07  ANNUAL AUDIT OF BOOKS.
   The Mayor and Council shall require an annual audit of the books of every
City officer, employee, board and commission that handles, collects or
disburses City funds. Such audit shall be made annually by an accountant who is
not a regular officer or employee of the City and who is thoroughly qualified
by training and experience.
(1958 Code § 2.8)
236.08  CLAIMS AGAINST CITY.
   (a)   Procedure for Filing; Notification to Claimant of Disallowance.  All
claims against the City, including claims for personal injury, but not
including officers' salaries and interest upon public debts, must be filed with
the Clerk-Treasurer. Upon the filing of any such claim, the party shall state
therein his post office address. Upon the disallowance of any such claim, it
shall be the duty of the Clerk-Treasurer to notify the claimant, his agent or
attorney by letter mailed to such address within five days after such
disallowance.
(1958 Code § 2.9)
   (b)   Appeal by Claimant Upon Disallowance by Council.  When the claim of
any person against the City, except a tort claim as defined in Section 23-2402,
Revised Statutes of Nebraska, 1943, Reissue of 1974, as amended, is disallowed
in whole or in part by Council, such person may appeal from the decision of
Council to the District Court of the County by causing a written notice to be
served on the Clerk-Treasurer within twenty days after making such decision and
executing a bond to the City, with good and sufficient sureties to be approved
by the Clerk-Treasurer, conditioned upon the faithful prosecution of such
appeal and the payment of all costs that may be adjudged against the appellant.
   (c)   Appeal by Taxpayer from an Allowance by Council.  Any taxpayer may
likewise appeal from the allowance of any claim against the City, except a tort
claim as defined in Section 23-2402, Revised Statutes of Nebraska, 1943,
Reissue of 1974, as amended, by serving a written notice upon the Clerk-
Treasurer within ten days from an allowance of a claim and giving bond similar
to that provided for in subsection (b) hereof. However, when Council, by
ordinance, provides for the publication of the list of claims allowed, giving
the amounts allowed and the names of the persons to whom allowed, in a
newspaper printed and published and of general circulation in the City, such
appeal may be taken by a taxpayer by serving a notice thereof within such time
after such publication as may be fixed by such ordinance and by giving bond for
such appeal within ten days after such allowance.
   (d)   Duties of Clerk-Treasurer Upon Appeal; Appeal Procedure.  The Clerk-
Treasurer, upon an appeal as referred to in subsections (b) and (c) hereof
being taken, and upon being paid the proper fees therefor, including fees for
filing the same in the District Court, shall make out a transcript of the
proceedings of Council, the Mayor and other officers as relate to the
presentation and allowance or disallowance of such claim and shall file the
same with the Clerk of the District Court within thirty days after the decision
allowing or disallowing the claim and paying the proper commencement fees. Such
appeal shall be entered on the docket of the Court and shall be tried and
determined according to the general laws of the State regulating appeals in
actions at law. No appeal bond shall be required of the City by any Court in
the case of an appeal by the City, and judgment shall be stayed pending such
appeal. (Adopting Ordinance)
   (e)   Personal Injuries Arising from Defective Public Places.  The City
shall not be liable for damages arising from defective streets, alleys,
sidewalks, public parks or other public places within the City unless actual
notice in writing of the accident or injury complained of, with a statement of
the nature and extent thereof and of the time when and the place where the same
occurred, is proved to have been given to the Mayor or Clerk-Treasurer within
thirty days after the occurrence of such accident or injury. It is the duty of
the Clerk-Treasurer to keep a record of such notice, showing the time when and
by whom such notice was given and describing the negligence complained of, and
to file such notice at once and report the same to Council at its next meeting.
However, no costs shall be recovered against the City in any action brought
against the City for personal injury sustained by reason of negligence of the
City if the claim therefor has not been presented to Council to be audited, nor
upon claims allowed in part, unless the recovery is for a greater sum than the
amount allowed, with the interest thereon.

attached to or within the legal boundaries of such property without first

while he is engaged in fighting a fire, the firefighter has the right to repel
such force and to take whatever measures are reasonably necessary under the
circumstances to remove the person who is causing the interference or hindering
the work of the firefighter, even to causing the arrest of such person. While a
firefighter has no authority to make an arrest except when he discovers someone
in the actual perpetration of a crime, he may ask police to arrest any person
who is willfully attempting to hinder him from performing his lawful duties and
he may take whatever steps are reasonably necessary and proper to prevent such
interference, even to the use of force.
   In addition, if the Division Chief deems it necessary to hold an
investigation, the property owner shall be so advised and will be required to
find housing until such time as the Chief or his assistant completes his
investigation, at which time the property owner will be so advised.

   (a)   The Civil Service Commission shall adopt and promulgate procedural
rules and regulations which provide in detail the manner in which examinations
may be held and any other matters assigned to it by the City Manager. At least
one copy of the rules and regulations and any amendments thereto shall be made
available for examination and reproduction by members of the public. One copy
of such rules and regulations and any amendments thereto shall be given to each
full-time firefighter and each full-time police officer.
   (b)   The Commission shall provide that all tests are practical and consist
only of subjects which will fairly determine the capacity of persons who are
examined to perform the duties of the position to which an appointment is to be
made. Such tests may include, but are not limited to, tests of physical fitness
and manual skill, as well as psychological testing.
   (c)   The Commission shall provide, by rules and regulations, for a credit
of ten percent in favor of all applicants for an appointment to an entry level
position, as defined by the City Manager, under civil service, who, in time of
war or in any expedition of the Armed Forces of the United States, have served
in and been honorably discharged from such Armed Forces and who have equaled or
exceeded the minimum qualifying standards established by the City Manager.
   (d)   The Commission may conduct an investigation concerning, and report
upon all matters regarding, the enforcement and effect of the Civil Service Act
and the rules and regulations prescribed.
   (e)   The Commission may inspect all institutions, departments, positions
and employments affected by the Civil Service Act to determine whether or not
the Act and all rules and regulations are being obeyed. Such investigations may
be conducted by the Commission or by any Commissioner designated by the
Commission for that purpose. The Commission shall also make a like
investigation on the written petition of a citizen, duly verified, stating that
irregularities or abuses exist or setting forth, in concise language, the
necessity for such an investigation. The Commission may be represented in such
investigations by the City Attorney, if authorized by the City Manager. If the
City Attorney does not represent the Commission, the Commission may be
represented by special counsel appointed by the Commission in any such
investigation. In the course of such investigation, the Commission, the
designated Commissioner or the Chief Examiner shall have the power to
administer oaths, issue subpoenas to require the attendance of witnesses and
the production by them of books, papers, documents and accounts pertaining to
the investigation, and to cause the depositions of witnesses, residing within
or without the State, to be taken in the manner prescribed by law for like
depositions in civil actions in the courts of this State. The oaths
administered and subpoenas issued shall have the same force and effect as the
oaths administered by a district judge in a judicial capacity and subpoenas
issued by the district courts of the State. The failure of any person so
subpoenaed to comply shall be deemed a violation of the Civil Service Act and
be punished as such. No investigation shall be made pursuant to this section if
there is a written accusation concerning the same subject matter against a
person in the civil service. Such accusation shall be handled pursuant to
Section
266.23.
   (f)   The Commission shall provide that all hearings and investigations
before the Commission, the designated Commissioner or the Chief Examiner shall
be governed by the Civil Service Act and the rules of practice and procedure to
be adopted by the Commission. In the conduct thereof, such hearings and
investigations shall not be bound by the technical rules of evidence. No
informality in any proceedings or hearing or in the manner of taking testimony
shall invalidate any order, decision, rule or regulation made, approved or
confirmed by the Commission, except that no order, decision, rule or regulation
made by any designated Commissioner conducting any hearing or investigation
alone shall be of any force or effect, unless it is concurred in by a majority
of the appointed members of the Commission, including the vote of any
Commissioner making the investigation.
   (g)   The Commission shall establish and maintain a roster of officers and
employees.
   (h)   The Commission shall provide for, establish and hold competitive tests
to determine the relative qualifications of persons who seek employment in any
position and, as a result thereof, shall establish eligible lists for the
various positions.
   (i)   The Commission shall make recommendations concerning a reduction in
force policy to the City Manager.
   (j)   The Commission shall keep such records as may be necessary for the
proper administration of the Civil Service Act.
   (k)   The Commission, upon request of the City Manager, shall establish and
maintain a list of names and addresses, for a period of time to be established
by the City Manager, of those eligible for appointment to or promotion within
the department.
   (l)   The Commission, upon request of the City Manager, shall certify the
names of the persons who are the three highest on the eligible list, following
the most recent examination, and whose qualifications have been validated by
the Commission for a vacant position.
   (m)   The Commission shall begin and conduct all civil suits which may be
necessary for the proper enforcement of the Civil Service Act and of the rules
of the Commission. The Commission may be represented in such suits and all
investigations pursuant to the Act by the City Attorney if authorized by the
City Manager. If the City Attorney does not represent the Commission, the
Commission may be represented by special counsel appointed by it in any
particular case.
(Ord. 1070. Passed 11-26-85.)
266.19  APPOINTMENTS AND PROMOTIONS FOR FIRE AND POLICE DIVISIONS.
   All appointments to and promotions in the Police and Fire Division shall be
made solely on merit, efficiency and fitness, which shall be ascertained by
open competitive examination and impartial investigation by the Commission.
   As used in this section, "appointment" means all means of selecting,
appointing or employing any person to hold any position or employment subject
to civil service. "Promotion" or "demotion" means changing from one position to
another, accompanied by a corresponding change in current rate of pay.
"Position" means an individual job which is designated by an official title
indicative of the nature of the work.
(Ord. 1070. Passed 11-26-85.)
266.20  REQUIREMENTS FOR CIVIL SERVICE POSITION APPLICANTS.
   An applicant for a position of any kind under civil service shall be able to
read and write the English language, meet the minimum job qualifications of the
position as established by the City Manager and be of good moral character. An
applicant shall disclose his or her past employment history and his or her
criminal record, if any. Prior to certifying to the City Manager the names of
persons eligible for a position, the Civil Service Commission shall validate
the qualifications of such person.
(Ord. 1070. Passed 11-26-85.)
266.21  FILLING VACANT POSITIONS.
   (a)   Considerations.  If the City Manager fills a vacancy in a position
subject to the Civil Service Act, he or she shall consider factors including,
but not limited to:
      (1)   The multiple job skills recently or currently being performed by
the applicant which are necessary for the position;
      (2)   The knowledge, skills and abilities of the applicant which are
necessary for the position;
      (3)   The performance appraisals of any applicant who is already employed
in the department, including any recent or pending disciplinary actions
involving the employee;
      (4)   The employment policies and staffing needs of the department,
together with contracts, ordinances and statutes related thereto;
      (5)   Required Federal, State or local certifications or licenses
necessary for the position; and
      (6)   The qualifications of applicants who are already employed in the
department and have successfully completed all parts of the examination for the
position. No person shall be reinstated in or transferred, suspended or
discharged from any such position or employment contrary to the Civil Service
Act.
   (b)   Procedure for Filling Vacant Positions.  Whenever a position subject
to the Civil Service Act becomes vacant, the City Manager shall make a
requisition upon the Civil Service Commission for the names and addresses of
persons eligible for appointment, and he or she may decline to fill such
vacancy for an indefinite period. If the Commission certifies fewer than three
names for a vacancy to the City Manager, the City Manager may appoint one of
such persons to fill the vacancy, may decline to fill the vacancy or may order
that another examination be held by the Commission.
   (c)   Temporary Appointments.  If a vacancy occurs and there is no eligible
list for the position or if the Commission has not certified persons from the
eligible list, a temporary appointment may be made by the City Manager. Such
temporary appointment shall not continue for longer than four months. No person
shall receive more than one temporary appointment or serve more than four
months as a temporary appointee in any one fiscal year.
(Ord. 1070. Passed 11-26-85.)
266.22  PROBATIONARY PERIODS.
   To enable the City Manager to exercise a choice in the filling of positions,
no appointment, employment or promotion in any position in the civil service
shall be deemed complete until after the expiration of three to six months of
probationary service for firefighters and not less than six months nor more
than one year after certification by the Nebraska Law Enforcement Training
Center, for police officers, as may be provided in the rules of the Civil
Service Commission. During such time, the City Manager may terminate the
employment of a person appointed by him or her if, during the performance test
thus afforded and upon an observation or consideration of the performance of
duties, the City Manager deems such person unfit or unsatisfactory for service
in the department. The City Manager may then appoint one of the other persons
certified by the Commission, and such person shall likewise enter upon such
duties until a person is found who is fit for appointment, employment or
promotion for the probationary period provided, at which time the appointment,
employment or promotion shall be complete.
(Ord. 1070. Passed 11-26-85.)
266.23  TENURE OF EMPLOYMENT; DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS.
   (a)   Tenure of Employment.  The tenure of a person holding a position of
employment under the Civil Service Act shall be only during good behavior.
   (b)   Causes for Disciplinary Action. Any such person may be removed or
discharged, suspended with or without pay, demoted, reduced in rank or deprived
of vacations, benefits, compensation or other privileges, except pension
benefits, for any of the following reasons:
      (1)   Incompetency, inefficiency or inattention to or dereliction of
duty;
      (2)   Dishonesty, prejudicial conduct, immoral conduct, insubordination,
discourteous treatment of the public or a fellow employee, any act of omission
or commission tending to injure the public service, any willful failure on the
part of the employee to properly conduct himself or herself or any willful
violation of the Civil Service Act or the rules and regulations adopted
pursuant to such Act;
      (3)   Mental or physical unfitness for the position which the employee
holds;
      (4)   Drunkenness or the use of intoxicating liquors, narcotics or any
other habit-forming drug, liquid or preparation to such an extent that the use
interferes with the efficiency or mental or physical fitness of the employee or
precludes the employee from properly performing the functions and duties of his
or her position;
      (5)   Conviction of a felony or misdemeanor tending to injure the
employee's ability to effectively perform the duties of his or her position; or
      (6)   Any other act or failure to act which, in the judgment of the Civil
Service Commissioners , is sufficient to justify the offender as an unsuitable
and unfit person to be employed in the public service.
   (c)   Disciplinary Action Procedure.
      (1)   No employee in the civil service who has been permanently appointed
to or inducted into the civil service shall be removed, suspended, demoted or
discharged, except for cause, and then only upon the written accusation of the
Police or Fire Chief, the City Manager or any resident or taxpayer.
      (2)   The written accusation shall set forth the alleged misconduct,
charges or grounds for investigation against the employee. The written
accusation shall be filed by the complainant with the Secretary of the
Commission, who shall cause a copy of such written accusation to be delivered,
within seventy-two hours after the filing, to the Police or Fire Chief, to the
City Manager and to the employee personally or by certified mail, addressed to
the employee at his or her residence address shown in the personnel records.
The Secretary of the Commission shall cause a return showing such delivery or
mailing, to be executed and filed in the Secretary's office.
      (3)   The Police or Fire Chief may immediately suspend, with pay, an
employee against whom such written accusation has been filed, pending the
decision of the City Manager to reinstate such employee or remove, demote,
discharge or suspend him or her, with or without pay.
      (4)   Prior to the decision of the City Manager to reinstate such
employee or remove, demote, discharge or suspend him or her, with or without
pay, the Police or Fire Chief shall, within a reasonable period of time,
investigate the alleged misconduct, charges or grounds against the employee and
explain the basis of the employer's evidence to the employee and provide the
employee an opportunity to present his or her version of the circumstances
which resulted in the filing of the written accusation. If the Chief's
investigation reveals other misconduct, charges or grounds, the Chief shall
amend the written accusation to include such other misconduct, charges or
grounds by filing an amendment to the written accusation with the Secretary of
the Commission. The Secretary shall cause a copy of such amended accusation to
be delivered, within seventy-two hours after the filing, to the Police or Fire
Chief, to the City Manager and to the employee personally or by certified mail,
addressed to the employee at his or her residence address shown in the
personnel records. The Secretary of the Commission shall cause a return showing
such delivery or mailing to be executed and filed in the Secretary's office. 
Upon completion of this procedure within a reasonable period of time, the
Police or Fire Chief shall recommend, in writing, to the City Manager that the
alleged misconduct, charges or grounds set forth in the written accusation be
deemed: to be without merit; to not warrant disciplinary action; to warrant
disciplinary action less severe than removal, demotion, discharge or
suspension, with or without pay, such as an oral or written reprimand; or to
warrant removal, demotion, discharge or suspension, with or without pay. If a
Police or Fire Chief is the subject of discipline, the City Manager shall
follow the same procedures as are followed by the Police or Fire Chief in
disciplinary proceedings involving their respective employees under his Act,
except for the written recommendation of the Police or Fire Chief.
      (5)   Within a reasonable period of time after receiving the written
recommendation of the Police or Fire Chief, in the case of an employee of one
of their respective departments, or, in the case of a Police or Fire Chief,
within a reasonable time after the City Manager's investigation, the City
Manager shall either decide to accept the recommendation of the Police or Fire
Chief as to his or her respective employee, or shall decide, in the case of an
employee or in the case of a Police or Fire Chief, that the alleged misconduct,
charges or grounds for investigation against the employee or the Police or Fire
Chief set forth in the written accusation be deemed: to be without merit; to
not warrant disciplinary action; to warrant disciplinary action less severe
than removal, demotion, discharge or suspension, with or without pay, such as
an oral or written reprimand; or to warrant removal, demotion, discharge or
suspension, with or without pay. The City Manager shall file a copy of his or
her decision with the Secretary of the Commission. At the same time, the City
Manager shall deliver a copy of his or her written decision to the employee, or
to the Police or Fire Chief, as the case may be, either personally or by
certified mail, addressed to the employee or to the Police or Fire Chief at his
or her residence address shown in the personnel records. In addition, the City
Manager shall file with the Secretary of the Commission a return showing
service of the City Manager's decision upon the employee. The Secretary of the
Commission shall cause a copy of such decision to be delivered, within seventy-
two hours after the filing, to the Police or Fire Chief, depending upon the
department to which the employee belongs.
      (6)   Any employee so removed, suspended, demoted or discharged may,
within ten calendar days after receiving written notice of the Manager's
decision, file a written demand for an investigation and public hearing by the
Commission. The employee shall file the request for the hearing with the
Secretary of the Commission and simultaneously send a copy of the request to
the City Manager. The failure to file such a request with the Secretary of the
Commission within ten calendar days of receipt of notice of the action by the
City Manager shall constitute a waiver of the employee's right to review by the
Commission, and the Manager's decision shall become final.
      (7)   Within five calendar days of receipt of the employee's notice of
appeal, the City Manager shall cause to be mailed or delivered to the employee
and Secretary of the Commission:
         A.   A statement of the changes;
         B.   The names of witnesses who will be called on behalf of the City
Manager and a general statement of the nature of their testimony; and
         C.   Copies of the documents to be introduced.
      (8)   Within ten calendar days of the filing of the written demand for an
investigation and public hearing with the Commission, the employee shall mail
or deliver the following to the City Manager and to the Commission:
         A.   A response to the statement of the charges;
         B.   The names of witnesses who will be called on behalf of the
employee and a general statement of the nature of their testimony; and
         C.   Copies of the documents to be introduced.
      (9)   Upon receipt of a written demand, the Commission shall conduct an
investigation. The Commission may be represented in such investigation and
public hearing by the City Attorney, if authorized by the City Manager. If the
City Attorney does not represent the Commission, the Commission may be
represented by special counsel, appointed by the Commission for any such
investigation and hearing. The investigation shall consist solely of a review
of the written submissions of the City Manager and the employee to determine
whether or not any individuals or documents should be subpoenaed by the
Commission for the subsequent public hearing before the Commission in order to
determine whether or not the City Manager acted in good faith for cause. "Good
faith for cause" means that the action was not arbitrary or capricious and was
not made for political or religious reasons.
      (10)   The Commission shall schedule a public hearing not less than ten
nor more than twenty calendar days from the date of filing of the employee's
written demand for an investigation. The Commission shall notify the City
Manager and the employee, in writing, at least three calendar days prior to the
date of the hearing, of the date, time and place of the hearing.
      (11)   The City Manager may appear in person and by counsel and may
present his or her case. The City Manager may present evidence by testimony and
documents and may cross-examine the employee's witnesses. At the hearing, the
employee may appear in person and by counsel and may present his or her
defense. The employee may present evidence by testimony and documents and may
cross-examine witnesses called by the City Manager.
      (12)   The Commission may affirm the action taken by the City Manager if
such action is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. If the Commission
finds that the removal, suspension, demotion or discharge was made for
political or religious reasons or was not made in good faith for cause, it
shall order the immediate reinstatement or re-employment of such employee in
the position or employment from which such employee was removed, suspended,
demoted or discharged. Such reinstatement shall, if the Commission in its
discretion so provides, be retroactive and shall entitle such person to
compensation and restoration of benefits and privileges from the time of such
removal, suspension, demotion or discharge.
      (13)   After the hearing, in lieu of affirming the removal, suspension,
demotion or discharge, the Commission may modify the order of removal,
suspension, demotion or discharge by directing a suspension, with or without
pay, for a given period, and the subsequent restoration to duty or demotion in
position or pay. Not later than ten calendar days after the hearing, the
Commission shall certify its findings, in writing, to the employee and to the
City Manager, who shall enforce them.
(Ord. 1070. Passed 11-26-85.)
266.24  REDUCTION IN FORCE POLICY.
   (a)   Establishment.  The City Manager, in establishing a reduction in force
policy, shall consider recommendations from the Civil Service Commission, but
shall not be bound by them. Prior to the adoption of a reduction in force
policy, the City Manager shall, after giving reasonable notice to each police
officer and firefighter by first-class mail, conduct a public hearing.
   (b)   Factors for Determination. The City Manager shall adopt a reduction in
force policy which shall consider factors including, but not limited to:
      (1)   The multiple job skills recently or currently being performed by
the employee;
      (2)   The knowledge, skills and abilities of the employee;
      (3)   The performance appraisal of the employee, including any recent or
pending disciplinary actions involving the employee;
      (4)   The employment policies and staffing needs of the department,
together with contracts, ordinances and statutes related thereto;
      (5)   Required Federal, State or local certifications or licenses; and
      (6)   Seniority.
(Ord. 1070. Passed 11-26-85.)
266.25  LEAVES OF ABSENCE.
   A leave of absence with or without pay may be granted by the City Manager to
any person under civil service. The City Manager shall give notice of such
leave to the Civil Service Commission. All appointments for temporary
employment resulting from such leaves of absence shall be made from the
eligible list, if any, of the civil service.

606.03  DISCRIMINATION BY CITY AGAINST HANDICAPPED PERSONS.
   The following grievance procedure is hereby established in and for the City.
Such procedure provides for prompt and equitable resolution of a complaint
alleging any action prohibited by any Federal department or agency regulation,
implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29
U.S.C. 794). Section 504 states, in part, that "no otherwise qualified
handicapped individual... shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded
from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to
discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial
assistance..."
   (a)   A complaint should be addressed to the City Manager, who is hereby
made responsible for coordinating Section 504 compliance efforts.
   (b)   A complaint should be filed in writing or verbally, contain the name
and address of the person filing it and briefly describe the alleged violation
of the regulations.
   (c)   A complaint should be filed within five working days after the
complainant becomes aware of the alleged violation. Processing of an allegation
of discrimination which occurred before the effective date of this section
(Resolution 841001, passed October 9, 1984) shall be considered on a case-by-
case basis.
   (d)   An investigation, as may be appropriate, shall follow a filing of a
complaint. The investigation shall be conducted by the Manager. This section
contemplates an informal but thorough investigation, affording all interested
persons and their representatives, if any, an opportunity to submit evidence
relevant to a complaint.
   Under Federal department or agency regulations, the City need not process a
complaint from an applicant for employment or from an applicant for admission
to post-secondary educational institutions.
   (e)   A written determination as to the validity of the complaint and a
description of the resolution, if any, shall be issued by the Manager, and a
copy of the same shall be forwarded to the complainant not later than five
working days after its filing.
   (f)   The Section 504 Coordinator shall maintain the files and records of
the City relating to the complaints filed.
   (g)   The complainant may request a reconsideration of the case in instances
where he or she is dissatisfied with the resolution. The request for
reconsideration should be made within five working days to the Manager.
   (h)   The right of a person to a prompt and equitable resolution of the
complaint filed under this section shall not be impaired by the person's
pursuit of other remedies such as the filing of a Section 504 complaint with
the responsible Federal department or agency. Utilization of the grievance
procedure set forth in this section is not a prerequisite to the pursuit of
other remedies.
   (i)   This section shall be construed to protect the substantive rights of
interested persons, to meet appropriate due process standards and to ensure
that the City complies with Section 504 and all implementing regulations.
(Res. 841001. Passed 10-9-84.)

fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation or noncompliance
occurs or continues.

   (d)   For dogs found to be running at large, the period of impounding shall
constitute the time allowed for the owner to claim or redeem his or her animal.
For every animal so claimed or redeemed, the owner shall pay redemption fees as
set out in the Master Fee Schedule, a copy of which is located at the office of
the City Clerk, as well as applicable impounding fees and the costs of disposal
of the animal, in the event that the owner does not claim the animal or orders

and costs. When an animal is impounded in the animal shelter as a dangerous
animal, an investigation shall be completed by the Police Department and said
investigation reports directed to the City Prosecutor for consideration of

"Dangerous Animal" Complaint, said animal shall continue to be held until such
time as the Complaint has been adjudicated or is dismissed. If said animal is
ordered by the Court to be destroyed pursuant to State statutes or Section
618.19, the animal shelter will comply with the Court Order therein and the
owner of said animal is responsible for and will pay an impoundment fee as set
out inthe Master Fee Schedule, a copy of which is located at the office of the
City Clerk thereafter to a maximum of five hundred dollars ($500), plus any
costs of destruction and disposal of the animal.

636.04  RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR SEXUAL PREDATORS.
   (a)   Purpose.
      (1)   The Nebraska Legislature has found that certain sex offenders
present a high risk to commit repeat offenses and has enabled cities to
restrict such person's place of residence as provided in the Sexual Predator
Residency Restriction Act.
      (2)   Persons at a high risk to repeat sexual offenses pose a great
threat to children and public safety generally. The physical and emotional cost
of sex offender victimization to society at large is incalculably high.
      (3)   It is the intent of this section to serve the City's compelling
interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the
citizens of the City, particularly the children, by creating certain areas
around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers
where certain sexual predators cannot reside.
   (b)   Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this
section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except
where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
      (1)   "Child care facility" means a place with a license issued under the
Nebraska Child Care Licensing Act, Sections 71-1908 to 71-1923, as currently
existing or hereafter amended.  It shall include licensed places both inside
and outside the corporate limits of the City.
      (2)   "Sex offender" means an individual who has been convicted of a
crime listed in Neb. Rev. Stat. Section 29-4003 (1)(a) and (b) and who is
required to register by the Sex Offender Registration Act or any person
convicted under the law of another state if, at the time of the conviction
under the law of such other state, the offense for which the person was
convicted would have required registration under the Nebraska Sex Offender
Registration Act, if the conviction occurred in Nebraska.
      (3)   "Sexual predator" shall mean an individual who is required to
register under the State of Nebraska's Sex Offender Registration Act, who
committed an aggravated offense as defined and has victimized a person who was
eighteen years of age or younger.
      (4)   "Residence" means a place where the person regularly sleeps, where
the person has established his home, where he is habitually present or to which
when he departs he intends to or does regularly return. A residence may include
more than one location and may be mobile or transitory. Residency may be shown
by, among other evidence, receipt of mail at the premises or identification of
the premises as a residence on a driver's license, vehicle registration or
other document, such as utility or other service billings.
      (5)   "School" shall mean a public, private, denominational or parochial
school which meets the requirements for accreditation or approval prescribed by
the State of Nebraska, pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. Chapter 79, and which has or
includes any or all grades kindergarten through twelfth grade.
   (c)   Sex Offender Residence Prohibitions; Exceptions and Penalties.
      (1)   Prohibited location of residence of sexual predator.  It shall be
unlawful for any sexual predator, as defined in subsection (b) hereof, to
reside within 500 feet of a school or child care facility.
      (2)   Measurement of distance.  For purposes of determining the minimum
distance separation, the requirement shall be measured by following a straight
line from the outer property line of the permanent residence or temporary
residence to the nearest outer boundary line of a school or child care
facility.
      (3)   Exceptions. A sexual predator residing within 500 feet of a school
or child care facility does not commit a violation of this section if he or
she:
         A.   Resides within a prison or a correctional or treatment facility
operated by the State or a political subdivision.
         B.   Established his or her residence location prior to July 1, 2006
and has not moved from that residence.
         C.   Established his or her residence after July 1, 2006, and the
school or child care facility triggering the restriction was established after
the initial date of the sexual predator's residence at that location.
         D.   The person is a minor residing with a parent.
         E.   The person's place of residence becomes a violation of this
section solely because of annexation into the City.
         F.   This section does not preclude a sexual predator deemed to be
handicapped or disabled under the Fair Housing Act, Rehabilitation Act or
Americans with Disabilities Act from pursuing requests for reasonable
accommodations.
      (4)   Penalties. A person who violates this section shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by imprisonment in
the county jail for a period not to exceed one year with a mandatory minimum
sentence of thirty days and a fine of not less than five hundred dollars
($500.00) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000).  A sexual predator who
violates this section may be ordered not to be present at the residence address
in the future and if found at said property or lot is subject to immediate
arrest to be brought before the court to show cause why he or she should not be
imprisoned for contempt.

808.01  PURPOSE.
   To protect the private and public health, safety and general welfare of
residents of the City and of the public generally from the danger of fire,
accident, explosion, gas, public nuisances and other hazards dangerous to
public peace, health and safety as a result of the drilling and operations for
oil and gas within the City, the potential for serious contamination of surface

disturbance of the City's peace and serenity through noxious odors, dust and
loud noises; threat of fluid spills and other damages to the surface of same;
and threat of damage to private and public facilities caused by heavy
equipment, it is necessary to limit the number and regulate the spacing,
drilling and operation of oil and gas wells and incidental facilities within
the City and abutting zoning jurisdiction of the City and as an incident
thereto it is further necessary to provide for a fair and just basis of
participation in the limited number of wells so drilled and in the production
therefrom.

(Ord. 907. Passed 9-26-77; Ord. 1589.  Passed 6-12-07.)
808.04  LOCATION OF WELLS.
   Except as may be otherwise expressly authorized or provided by Council, no
well shall be drilled nearer than 500 feet from any church, school or other
public building or residence as now established in the City, or nearer than
forty feet from the front or street property line of the particular property on
which such well is drilled, or nearer than fifty feet from the exterior
boundary line of the drilling block upon which the same is located. Council may
authorize directional drilling to properly drain any drilling unit when the
surface location permissible is such as to prevent proper drainage by a
vertically drilled well.
(Ord. 907. Passed 9-26-77; Ord. 1589.  Passed 6-12-07.)
808.05  PERMIT APPLICATION AND ISSUANCE.
   Before a permit for the drilling of any well for the production of oil and
gas on any drilling block is issued, a written application therefor shall be
filed with the City Clerk. Such application shall:
   (a)   State the name of the applicant;
   (b)   Describe the drilling block upon which the proposed well is to be
located; and
   (c)   State the proposed depth or formation to which such well is to be
drilled. In addition, such application shall have attached thereto:
   (d)   Either certified or photostatic copies of all leases, contracts or
other instruments under which the applicant claims the right to drill a well
for oil and gas on lands in such drilling block;
   (e)   A certificate of a qualified engineer showing the exact acreage within
the drilling block and the total acreage owned, leased or otherwise controlled
by the applicant; and
   (f)   A map or plat of the drilling block showing, either by stated
dimensions or according to scale, the location of the proposed well and of all
tanks, pits, embankments, fences and other details of the proposed use of the
property necessary or incident to the drilling of the well.
   The application shall be verified by the applicant or his duly authorized
agent. The application may be filed by any person who, in the absence of this
section, would, by reason of ownership, lease, contractor otherwise, own or
control the right to drill upon or develop for oil and gas all or any part of
the subject drilling block.
   Upon the filing of any application for the drilling of a well hereunder, the
same shall forthwith be referred by the City Clerk to Council, whereupon
Council shall, without delay, set the same for hearing at an early date, cause
notice of such hearing to be given and proceed to hear and consider the same.
If, upon such hearing, it is found that the applicant owns, holds leases upon
or otherwise controls the whole of such drilling block and that such
application and the location and other circumstances incident to the drilling
of the proposed well comply with this section, the applicant shall be issued a
permit to drill the same subject only to the other provisions and conditions of
this chapter and the laws of the State. If, upon such hearing, it is found that
the applicant owns, holds leases on or otherwise controls less than the whole
of such drilling block, Council, taking into account the rights, interests and
equities of the several persons who, in the absence of this chapter, would have
the right to drill on the different parts of the drilling block, shall grant a
permit for the drilling of the well upon such terms and conditions as are found
by Council to be fair and reasonable and such as will avoid unnecessary
hardship, carry out the spirit of this chapter and result in substantial
justice to all concerned, provided that regardless of who may file the
application, the person owning, holding leases on or otherwise controlling the
right to drill fifty percent or more of the drilling block shall have the
right, if such person within a reasonable time to be fixed by Council elects to
do so, to manage, conduct and carry on the drilling and operation of the well.
   The granting of a permit to drill a well to a particular depth or formation
shall constitute a permit to complete the well in a shallower formation if
another well on the same drilling block is not already completed in and
producing from such shallower formation, in which event, another permit may be
granted for the drilling of another well thereon to such deeper formation if no
other well on such drilling block is completed in and producing from such
deeper formation.
   Any permit granted in compliance with this section shall automatically
expire unless, within ninety days from the date of issuance of such permit, the
person to whom such permit has been issued has commenced drilling operations on
the drilling block designated in the permit.
(Ord. 907. Passed 9-26-77.)
808.06  PERMIT T(7 DRILL ADDITIONAL WELLS.
   It shall be within the power of Council, by proper enactment, to permit the
drilling of additional wells on the drilling blocks created by this chapter.
Regardless of any increase in the number of wells that may later be authorized
to be drilled on any drilling block as created hereunder, the size of the
drilling block shall not be reduced.
(Ord. 907. Passed 9-26-77.)
808.07  BOND AND INSURANCE REQUIRED.
   No permit for the drilling of any well shall be issued until the applicant
has filed with the City Clerk a good and sufficient bond and proof of insurance
coverage, such bond to be executed by, and the insurance to be held with, a
bonding, indemnity or insurance company authorized to do business within the
State, with such bond to run in the name of the City and conditioned on the
applicant's drilling the well in conformity with the provisions of this
section, the statutes of the State and the rules and regulations of the State
Geologist. The amount of such bond shall be thirty thousand dollars ($30,000)
and it shall be kept in force at all times during the drilling operations. The
applicant shall also file with the Clerk a certificate of insurance showing
that such applicant has purchased liability insurance in the principal sum of
not less than one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) covering any
liability imposed by law or damages on account of injury to property, either
private or public, or bodily injury, including death, received or suffered by
any person and resulting from the drilling operation or maintenance of such
well or any structure, machinery, equipment or tank connected therewith. Such
insurance shall be approved by Council and shall be kept in full force and

   No person, either as principal or agent, shall make any excavation in any
part of the streets, alleys, highways, parkings, sidewalk areas or other public
property for the purpose of laying, installing or maintaining any pipeline in
or upon such property without first having obtained a permit from the City
Clerk to do so. The applicant for such permit shall file with the City Clerk a
plan showing in detail the size of such pipeline, the exact location of such
excavation or pipeline, the depth and width thereof and the location thereof,
with particular reference to all structures or lines of the City or any public
utility, and the sidewalks, pavements or other public improvements. Each
applicant for a permit hereafter shall pay an inspection and regulation fee for
such permit based on the number of rods in length that such pipeline occupies
in the streets, alleys, highways, parkings, sidewalk areas or other public
property belonging to the City in the following amounts:
   Where the width of the ditch excavated for such pipeline does not exceed
twenty-five inches, the fee shall be per rod, even though more than one
pipeline is laid in the same ditch.
   Each owner of a pipeline shall, for each year such pipeline is continued and
maintained under the streets or alleys, pay on May 1 in each year, an annual
inspection and regulation fee per rod for each pipeline for each and every rod
such pipeline occupies in the streets, alleys, highways, parkings, sidewalk
areas or other public property belonging to the City, provided, however, that
upon the payment per rod for a permit, such owner shall not be required to pay
the annual inspection and regulation fee per rod until May 1 following the
issuance of such permit. Any permit may be revoked upon ten days notice for the
failure to pay the fees herein required and each day of continuance of the
pipeline after such revocation shall constitute a separate offense. Before any
excavation is made for the purpose of removing any pipeline located in or upon
any part of any street, alley, highway, parking, sidewalk area or other public
property, the person desiring to make the removal shall obtain a permit for
such purpose in the same manner as provided herein for the installation of such
pipeline and shall pay an inspection and regulation fee to be determined as
provided herein for the installation of such pipeline.

Ch. 822
824.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate and punish acts of aggressive
panhandling or solicitation and acts of panhandling or solicitation that occur
at locations or under circumstances specified herein.  The purpose of this
chapter is not to punish the status or condition of any person.  Regulation is
required because aggressive panhandling anywhere in the City contributes to the
loss of access to and enjoyment of public places and can create a sense of fear
and intimidation in citizens solicited by strangers. Regulation is further
required because panhandling in certain areas threatens the economic vitality
of those areas, impairing the City's long-term goals of attracting citizens,
businesses and tourists to these certain areas and, consequently, the City
overall. The City has substantial interests in the protection of public safety,
the use of public transportation, the safe and unobstructed flow of traffic on
its public streets, the preservation of the safe use of public areas,
protecting the aesthetics of historic areas within the City, protecting the
City's investment in certain areas, protecting tourism and protecting the
City's economy. The regulations in this chapter further these substantial
interests. This chapter is not intended to proscribe any demand for payment for
services rendered or goods delivered; nor is this chapter intended to prohibit
acts authorized as an exercise of a person's constitutional right to legally
picket, protest or speak.
(Ord. 1639.  Passed 6-8-10.)

858.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses
to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of
the City and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the
deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within
the City. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of
imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the
intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to
sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access
by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone
or legitimize the distribution of obscene material or sexual activities.
(Ord. 1586.  Passed 2-27-07.)
858.02  FINDINGS.
   Based on convincing documented evidence, studies, findings and reports
concerning the negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses
regarding both commercial and residential areas and the nexus between sexually
oriented businesses, obscene materials and sexual exhibits and alcohol
consumption, and illegal drug distribution and use, the City Council finds:
   (a)   Sexually oriented businesses have negative secondary effects on the
existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent
to them, causing increased crime, the downgrading of property values, the
downgrading of adjacent neighborhoods, making adjacent neighborhoods
significantly less attractive and less safe for raising children and
denigrating both residential life and commercial activity for other types of
businesses.  Sexually oriented businesses downgrade the quality of life and
fitness of property for other uses in areas both immediate and adjacent to such
businesses.
   (b)   The negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses are
increased when they are located in close proximity to each other and when the
service or consumption of alcohol is permitted at or near such locations.
   (c)   Improper conduct involving sexual acts occurs at sexually oriented
businesses which provide private or semi-private booths or viewing rooms for
the viewing of films, videos or live performances.
   (d)   The findings noted above raise substantial governmental concerns for
the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City and it is
appropriate for the purpose of promoting and protecting the health, safety and
welfare of the citizens of the City, particularly the children of the community
and those conducting general business, that reasonable regulations be enacted
so as to address the substantial governmental concerns to minimize and control
the negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses and thereby
promote and protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City,
protect the citizens from increased crime, preserve the value of property, and
preserve the quality of life and the quality and character of surrounding
neighborhoods for residential and commercial purposes.
   (e)   The enactment of reasonable regulations of sexually oriented
businesses which involve locational criteria, licensing criteria, operational
criteria, and the prohibition of alcohol and illegal substance use are
appropriate to address the substantial governmental concerns and protect the
health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City.
   (f)   A reasonable licensing procedure and zoning requirements are
appropriate mechanisms to place the burden of reasonable regulations on the
owners of sexually oriented businesses and such a licensing procedure will
place an incentive on the owners to see that the sexually oriented business is
operated in a manner which is consistent with the health, safety and welfare of
patrons, employees and citizens of the City.

(Ord. 1610.  Passed 7-8-08.)
882.10  LODGING BUSINESS OCCUPATION TAX.
   (a)   Definitions.  As used in this section, the following words and phrases
shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the
context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
      (1)   “City” shall mean the City of Sidney and the area within the
corporate limits of the City of Sidney.
      (2)   “City Clerk” shall mean the Clerk/Treasurer of the City of Sidney,
Nebraska.
      (3)   “Lodging business” shall mean any person or entity that for
monetary compensation rents a room or rooms or space on a daily to weekly
charge basis.  Such businesses include, but are not limited to hotels, motels,
bed and breakfasts and campgrounds.
      (4)   “Person” shall mean any natural person, individual, partnership,
association, organization or corporation of any kind or character engaging in
the business of providing lodging on a daily to weekly rental basis.
      (5)   “Taxpayer” shall mean any person engaged in the hotel, motel, bed
and breakfast, campground or other lodging business as herein defined who is
required to pay the tax herein imposed.
   (b)   Intent and Purpose of Section.
      (1)   The City Council determines and declares that persons engaging in,
carrying on, or pursuing any lodging business such as a hotel, motel, bed and
breakfast or campground are directly or indirectly benefitted from tourism and
the general public access to such lodging businesses throughout the City street
system which provides easy access to such businesses and to services required
by their lodgers. Such use places unique demands on the City's resources for
street care, maintenance, repair, construction and replacement.  Further,
people who patronize a business for lodging purposes within the City and the
areas within the corporate limits of the same use such public street resources
to access other connected services which street use requires the investment of
public funds for care, maintenance, repair, construction and replacement.  The
street system benefits such businesses by providing easy access to not only
lodging but to food, fuel, goods and other services provided within the City.
      (2)   Pursuant to the authority of Nebraska Revised Statute R.R.S. 1943,
Section 16-205, the City Council finds, determines and declares that it is
appropriate that a tax be imposed on all lodging businesses including but not
limited to hotels, motels, bed and breakfast, and campground businesses for the
purpose of raising revenues for street system care, maintenance, repair,
construction and replacement. The foregoing determination is made with due
consideration of such businesses in the City and the relation of business to
the municipal welfare, together with relation thereof, to expenditures required
by the City and with consideration of just, proper and equitable distribution
of the tax burden for street care, maintenance, repair, construction and
replacement within the City.
   (c)   Tax Imposed; Collection of Tax.
      (1)   On or after November 1, 2009 and in each calendar month thereafter
there is hereby imposed an occupation tax on lodging businesses upon each and
every person conducting such lodging business within the City for any period of
time during a calendar month. The amount of tax shall be two percent of all
gross receipts for each calendar month derived from lodgers or customers.
      (2)   A person engaged in the lodging business may itemize the tax levied
on a bill, receipt or other invoice to the lodger or customer, but each person
engaged in the lodging business shall remain liable for the tax imposed by this
section.
      (3)   Gross receipts subject to the tax shall include receipts for all
services for which compensation is received except that gross receipts subject
to tax shall not include the sale of food in a lodging facility if separately
itemized and subject to the occupation tax on food and beverage services.
   (d)   Tax Imposed for Revenue Purposes; Tax Cumulative.
      (1)   The tax imposed by this section is purely for revenue purposes to
support the care, maintenance, repair, construction and replacement of the City
street system. The levy of the tax under this section is in addition to all
other fees, taxes, excises and licenses levied and imposed under any contract
or any other provisions of this Code or ordinances of the City, in addition to
any fee, tax, excise or license imposed by the State.
      (2)   Payment of the tax imposed by this section shall not relieve the
person paying the same from payment of any other tax now or hereafter imposed
by contract or ordinance or by this Code, including those imposed for any
business or occupation he or she may carry on, unless so provided therein. It
is the intent of this Council that the occupation taxes imposed by this section
shall be cumulative except where otherwise specifically provided.
   (e)   Exemptions.  The tax imposed by this section shall not be due on:
      (1)   Any fee received exclusively by a religious, civic, educational,
charitable, governmental, or political organization exempt from income taxes
under the United States Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   Any fee received for any scientific and literary lectures or
entertainment as described in Nebraska Revised Statutes Section 16-205.
      (3)   Any fee received for concerts and other musical entertainments
given exclusively by the citizens of the City as stated in Nebraska Revised
Statutes Section 16-205.
      (4)   Any fee received by any person engaged in business within the City
not within the taxing power of the City under the Constitution of the United
States and the Constitution and Statutes of the State of Nebraska.
      (5)   The value of food or beverages furnished by lodging businesses to
employees as part of their compensation when no charge is made to the employee.
      (6)   Tips to an employee of a lodging business when the amount of the
tip is wholly in the discretion of the purchaser, whether or not the tip is
paid to the employee or added to the bill and if the sole amount of the tip is
turned over to the employee. Amounts that are added to the price of the room or
accommodation and required to be paid by the purchaser, whether or not
designated as a tip or a service charge, shall be exempt as a tip to the extent
the mandatory amount does not exceed twenty percent of the sales price.
   (f)   Return.
      (1)   Each and every person engaged in the lodging business within the
City for the calendar month beginning November, 2009, and for each and every
calendar month thereafter, shall prepare and file, on or before the last day of
the month following on a form prescribed by the City Clerk, a return for the
taxable calendar month, and at the same time pay to the City Clerk the tax
herein imposed.
      (2)   The City Clerk may, by regulation, specify a uniform class of
taxpayer that may make reports and remittances quarterly in lieu of monthly,
taking into consideration the amount of tax due. In addition, a person subject
to the tax imposed herein may, upon written application to and with the written
consent of the City Clerk, make reports and remittances on a quarterly basis in
lieu of monthly. Such quarterly reports shall be due on the 15th day of April,
July, October and January of each year and shall report the gross receipts and
the amount due for the three months immediately preceding the months in which
the reports and remittances are required.
   (g)   Suspension or Revocation of Other Licenses.  No delinquency in payment
of the tax herein provided for by this section and no revocation or conviction
for violation of this section shall be grounds for the suspension or revocation
of any other license issued to any person engaged in business within the City
by the City Clerk or any other official of the City under any licensing
provisions of this Code or other ordinances, nor shall the same be grounds for
the suspension or revocation of any other license issued by any licensing
authority pursuant to the statutes enacted by the State of Nebraska.
   (h)   Failure to File Return; Delinquency; Assessment by City Clerk.
      (1)   If any person neglects or refuses to make a return or payment of
the taxes as required by this section, the City Clerk shall make an estimate,
based upon such information as may be reasonably available, of the amount of
taxes due for the period or periods for which the taxpayer is delinquent, and
upon the basis of such estimated amount, compute and assess in addition thereto
a penalty equal to ten percent thereof, together with interest on such
delinquent taxes, at the rate of one percent per month, or fraction thereof
from the date when due.
      (2)   The City Clerk shall give the delinquent taxpayer written notice of
such estimated taxes, penalty and interest, which notice must be served
personally or by certified mail.
      (3)   Such estimate shall thereupon become an assessment, and such
assessment shall be final and due and payable from the taxpayer to the City
Clerk ten days from the date of service of the notice or the date of mailing by
certified mail; however, within such ten day period, the delinquent taxpayer
may petition the City Clerk for a revision or modification of such assessment
and shall, within such ten day period, furnish the City Clerk the facts and
correct figures showing the correct amount of such taxes.
      (4)   Such petition shall be in writing, and the facts and figures
submitted shall be submitted in writing and shall be given under oath of the
taxpayer.
      (5)   Thereupon, the City Clerk shall modify such assessment in
accordance with the facts which he or she deems correct. Such adjusted
assessment shall be made in writing and notice thereof shall be mailed to the
taxpayer within ten days. All such decisions shall become final upon the
expiration of thirty days from the date of service, unless proceedings are
commenced within that time for appeal in the District Court of Cheyenne County,
Nebraska by the filing of a petition with the Clerk of the Court. This appeal
shall be conducted in conformance with the Nebraska Rules of Civil Procedure
and Rules of the Court as may be adopted by the Court from time to time or
enacted or amended by the Legislature.
   (i)   Jeopardy Assessment.
      (1)   If the City Clerk finds that the collection of the tax will be
jeopardized by delay, in his or her discretion, he or she may declare the
taxable period immediately terminated, determine the tax, and issue notice and
demand for payment thereof, and, having done so, the tax shall be due and
payable forthwith, and the City Clerk may proceed to collect such tax as
hereinafter provided.
      (2)   Collection may be stayed if the taxpayer gives such security for
payment as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the City Clerk.
   (j)   Administration of Section; Miscellaneous Provisions.
      (1)   Administration by City Clerk.  The administration of the provisions
of this section are hereby vested in the City Clerk, who shall prescribe forms
in conformity with this section for the making of returns for the
ascertainment, assessment and collection of the tax imposed hereunder, and for
the proper administration and enforcement hereof.
      (2)   Duties performed by others.  Duties of the City Clerk herein
provided may be performed by any qualified person designated by the City Clerk.
      (3)   Notices to be sent by registered or certified mail. All notices
required to be given to the taxpayer under the provisions of this section shall
be in writing, and if mailed postpaid by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, to him or her at his or her last known address shall be
sufficient for the purposes of this section.
      (4)   Duty to keep books and records. It shall be the duty of every
taxpayer to keep and preserve suitable records and other books or accounts as
may be necessary to determine the amount of tax for which he or she is liable
hereunder.
         A.   Records of the gross revenue by which this tax is measured shall
be kept separate and apart from the records of other sales or receipts in order
to facilitate the examination of books and records as necessary for the
collection of this tax.
         B.   It shall be the duty of every such taxpayer to keep and preserve
for a period of three years all such books, invoices and other records, which
shall be open for examination at any time by the City Clerk or his or her duly
designated manager or agent. If such person keeps or maintains books, invoices,
accounts or other records, or any thereof, outside of the State, upon demand of
the City Clerk, they shall make the same available at a suitable place within
the City, to be designated by the City Clerk, for examination, inspection and
audit by the City Clerk or person duly authorized by him or her.
         C.   The City Clerk, in his or her discretion, may make, permit or
cause to be made examination, inspection or audit of books, invoices, accounts
or other records so kept or maintained by such person outside of the State at
the place where same are kept or maintained or at any place outside the State
where the same may be made available, provided such person shall have entered
into a binding agreement with the City to reimburse it for all costs and
expenses incurred by it in order to have such examination, inspection or audit
made in such place.
      (5)   Investigation of taxpayer's books. For the purpose of ascertaining
the correctness of a return, or for the purpose of determining the amount of
tax due from any person, the City Clerk or persons authorized by him or her may
hold investigation and hearings concerning any matters covered by this section;
and may examine any relevant books, papers, records or memoranda of any such
person, or of any person having knowledge thereof; and may take testimony and
require proof of his or her information. The City Clerk and person or persons
duly authorized shall have power to administer an oath to such person.
      (6)   Sale of business. Whenever any taxpayer sells his or her lodging
business or quits engaging in such business, any tax payable under this section
shall become immediately due and payable and such person shall immediately make
a report and pay the tax due to date of sale or closing, whichever occurs
later.
      (7)   Status of unpaid tax and bankruptcy or receivership. Whenever the
business or property of any taxpayer subject to this section shall be placed in
receivership, bankruptcy or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or seized
under distraint for property taxes, all taxes, penalties, and interest imposed
by this section and for which the taxpayer is in any way liable under the terms
of this section shall be a prior and preferred lien against the property of the
taxpayer, except as to pre-existing claims or liens of a bona fide mortgagee,
pledgee, judgment creditor or purchaser whose rights shall have attached prior
to the filing of the notice as hereinafter provided on the property of the
taxpayer; and no sheriff, receiver, assignee or other official shall sell the
property of any person subject to this section under process or order of any
court without first ascertaining from the City Clerk the amount of any taxes
due and payable under this section; and if there be any such taxes due, owing
and unpaid, it shall be the duty of such officer to first pay the amount of
such taxes out of the proceeds of such sale before making payment of any monies
to any judgment creditor or other claimants of whatsoever kind or nature,
except the cost of the proceedings and other pre-existing claims or liens as
above provided.
      (8)   Release of liens.  The tax imposed by this section, together with
the interest and penalties herein provided and the cost of collection which may
be incurred, shall be and, until paid, remain a first and prior lien, except as
otherwise provided by the Constitution or Statute, superior to all other liens,
on all the merchandise, furniture and fixtures, tools and equipment of the
taxpayer within the City, and may be foreclosed by seizing under distraint and
sale of so much of said merchandise, furniture and fixtures, tools and
equipment, as may be necessary to discharge the lien. The lien created by this
section shall apply only to tax obligations hereafter incurred. Any lien for
taxes as shown on the records of the County Clerks and Recorders as herein
provided shall, upon the payment of all taxes, penalties and interest covered
thereby, be released by the City Clerk in the same manner as mortgages or
judgments are released.
      (9)   Statute of limitations. No suit for collection of any taxes imposed
by this section for any interest thereon or penalties with respect thereto may
be instituted, or any other action to collect the same shall be commenced, nor
shall any notice of lien be filed, or distraint warrant be issued, more than
three years after the date on which the tax was or is payable. In case of a
false or fraudulent return with intent to evade tax, the tax, together with
interest and penalties thereon, may be assessed or proceedings for the
collection of such taxes may be begun at any time. Before the expiration of
such period of limitation, the taxpayer and the City Clerk may agree in writing
to an extension thereof; and the period so agreed on may be extended by
subsequent agreement in writing.
   (k)   Recovery of Unpaid Taxes by Action at Law.
      (1)   The City Clerk may also treat any such taxes, penalties or interest
due and unpaid as a debt due the City.
      (2)   In case of failure to pay the taxes, or any portion thereof, or any
penalty or interest thereon when due, the City Clerk may recover at law the
amount of such taxes, penalties and interest in any court of Cheyenne County,
Nebraska, or of a court having jurisdiction in the county where the taxpayer
resides or has its principal place of business.
      (3)   The return of the taxpayer or the assessment made by the City
Clerk, as herein provided, shall be prima facie proof of the amount due.
      (4)   Such actions may be actions and attachments and writs of attachment
may be issued to the constable or sheriff, as the case may be; and in any such
proceeding no bond shall be required of the City Clerk except as may be
required by statute, nor shall any constable or sheriff require of the City
Clerk an indemnifying bond for executing the writ of attachment or writ of
execution upon any judgment entered in such proceeding; and, in accordance with
the procedure established by statute, if any, the City Clerk may prosecute
appeals or writs of error in such cases without the necessity of providing bond
therefor.
      (5)   The City Attorney, when requested by the City Clerk, with the
consent of the Council, may commence an action for the recovery of taxes due
under this section; and this remedy shall be in addition to all other existing
remedies, or remedies provided in this section.
   (l)   City a Party to Title Actions for Determination of Lien.  In any
action affecting the title to real estate or the ownership or rights to
possession of personal property, the City may be made a party defendant for the
purpose of obtaining a judgment or determination of its lien upon the property
involved therein.
   (m)   Authority of City Clerk to Waive Penalty.  The City Clerk is hereby
authorized to waive, for good cause shown, any penalty assessed as in this
section provided; and any interest imposed in excess of six percent per annum
shall be deemed a penalty.
   (n)   Penalty.
      (1)   Penalties for deficiencies caused by disregard of rules. If any
part of the deficiency is due to negligence or intentional disregard of
authorized rules and regulations with knowledge thereof, but without intent to
defraud, there shall be added ten percent of the total amount of the
deficiency; and in such case interest shall be collected at the rate of one
percent per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of the deficiency from
the time the return was due, from the person required to file the return, which
interest in addition shall become due and payable within ten days after written
notice and demand by the City Clerk.
      (2)   Penalties for deficiencies caused by fraud.  If any part of the
deficiency is due to fraud or with the intent to evade the tax, then there
shall be added fifty percent of the total amount of the deficiency, and in such
case the whole amount of the tax that is unpaid, including the additions, shall
become due and payable ten days after written notice and demand by the City
Clerk, and an additional one percent per month, or fraction thereof, on said
amounts shall be added from the date the return was due until paid.

   (b)   To defer the cost of construction or expanding capacity of electrical
service, fees as set out in the Master Fee Schedule of the City of Sidney shall
be due prior to the beginning of construction of electrical service to a lot or
subdivision.
      (1)   The above construction cost recovery charges are in addition and
separate from meter fees or other assessments for electrical service and are
meant to partially offset the cost to the City to construct such service. For
multiple lots or a subdivision requiring the construction of distribution
services, the charge for all lots which can later be served from said
distribution lines when constructed shall be paid as each of the lots are
connected to the distribution lines. However, the City shall assess a
distribution cost per foot as set out in the Master Fee Schedule if the
distribution system is over 500 feet and lots are not connected to the
distribution lines when constructed.
      (2)   All required fees are to be paid at the office of the City Clerk
prior to the time the Electrical Department begins any line construction or
installation of meters.
   (c)   To defer the cost of construction or expanding capacity of water
service, fees as set out in the Master Fee Schedule of the City of Sidney shall
be due prior to the time the meter is put in the home or business owner's name.
      (1)   The above construction charges are in addition and separate from
any tapping fees, connection fees, meter fees or other assessments and are
meant to partially offset the cost to the City to construct such service.
      (2)   The applicable water service cost recovery construction fee is to
be paid at the office of the City Clerk.

1042.01  DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter
   (a)   "Air gap separation" means the unobstructed vertical distance through
the free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet
supplying water to a tank, plumbing fixture or other device and the flood level
rim of the receptacle. An air gap separation is used to prevent either backflow
or backsiphonage.
   (b)   "Atmospheric vacuum breaker" or "nonpressure-type backsiphonage
preventer" means a device which prevents backsiphonage by creating an
atmospheric vent when there is either a negative pressure or subatmospheric
pressure in a water system. Such a device is used as protection for direct or
indirect water connections to all types of polluted or contaminated liquids,
where the preventer is not subjected to backpressures and is installed on the
discharge side of the last control valve. This preventer should not be
subjected to continuous flows for periods of more than twelve hours.
   (c)   "Backflow" means the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or
substances into the water distribution system from other than the intended
liquids, mixtures or substances of the public water supply system.
   (d)   "Backsiphonage" means the flowing back of water or other liquids,
mixtures or substances into a water distribution system due to negative
pressure in the piping of the water distribution system.
   (e)   "Belt line," "main" and "commercial main" mean any pipe other than a
supply pipe or service pipe used for the purposes of carrying water to or
distributing it in the City.
   (f)   "Contaminant" means a substance that will impair the quality of the
water to a degree that it creates a serious health hazard to the public,
leading to poisoning or the spread of disease.
   (g)   "Cross-connection" means any actual or potential connection or
structural arrangement within a water distribution system through which it is
possible to introduce into the public water supply system any water, liquids,
mixtures or substances, other than the intended water, liquids, mixtures or
substances of the public water supply system.
   (h)   "Double check-valve assembly backflow preventer" means a device
containing one or two independently operated spring loaded check valves and an
independently operated spring loaded air inlet valve located on the discharge
side of the check or checks. The device includes tightly closing shut-off
valves on each side of the check valves and properly located test cocks for the
testing of the check valve. It is used as protection for all direct or indirect
water connections through which foreign substances might enter the system in
such concentrations as to constitute a nuisance or be aesthetically
objectionable. Examples of such substances are foods, beverages or other
substances that do not constitute a health hazard.
   (i)   "Nontoxic substance" means any substance of a nonpoisonous nature that
may create a moderate or minor hazard to the domestic water system.
   (j)   "Hazardous connections" means and includes:
      (1)   Connections to food processing lines, including, but not limited
to, those carrying syrups, lard or beer;
      (2)   Connections to steam and steam boilers where the steam does not
come in contact with toxic substances;
      (3)   McDaniel tees or steam clean-up connections in food plants,
apartment house boilers, or pressing boilers where toxic compounds are not
used; and
      (4)   Connections to enclosed circulating systems, such as radiant-
heating systems and refrigerated-water systems, where toxic compounds are not
used.
   (k)   "Pressure vacuum breaker backsiphonage preventer" means an assembly of
two independently operating spring loaded check valves with tightly closing
shut off valves on each side of the check valves, plus properly located test
cocks for the testing of each check valve. It is used as a protection for
direct or indirect water connections to all types of polluted or contaminated
liquids, where the preventer is not subjected to backpressures. This device may
be installed for use under continuous line pressure.
   (l)   "Reduced-pressure device backflow preventer" means an assembly
consisting of two independently operating approved check valves with an
automatically operating differential relief valve located between the two check
valves, tightly closing shut-off valves on each side of the check valves, plus
properly located test cocks for the testing of the check valves and the relief
valve. It is used as protection for direct or indirect water connections where
the device may be subject to back-pressures from toxic chemicals, sewage or
other lethal substances.
   (m)   "Separate premises," when considering the expediency of permitting
deduct meters or more than one consumer to secure water from the same service
or supply pipe, means a separate dwelling or apartment, a building or structure
used for a separate business or each distinct business in a business building
or structure, provided that if deduct meters or two or more consumers are
allowed or permitted on the same service or supply pipe, each such consumer
shall be billed for and shall pay the monthly minimum, and provided, further,
that where a separate business and a dwelling are used in connection by the
same owner or by the same tenant and are on the same City lot or parcel of
ground and are occupied by the same person and his or her family, the same
shall constitute a separate premises.
   (n)   "Service pipe" means the pipe extending from the shut-off, stop box,
curb cock or valve at or near the lot line to and beyond the property line of
the consumer.
   (o)   "Supply pipe" means any pipe tapped into a main and extending thence
to a point at or near the lot line of the consumer's premises where the
shutoff, stop box, curb cock or valve is located.
   (p)   "Toxic substance" means any substance (liquid, solid or gaseous),
including raw sewage and lethal substances, that when introduced into the water
supply system creates or may create a danger to the health and well being of
the consumer. Hazardous connections include, but are not limited to, flush
valve toilets and direct connections to contaminated vessels or systems.
(Ord. 1174. Passed 4-24-90.)
1042.02  DUTIES GENERALLY OF CITY MANAGER.

management of the water plant and system, pump house, machinery and appliances
used in connection with producing and distributing water to inhabitants of the
City under the general direction of the Mayor and Council.
(1958 Code § 27.2)
1042.03  CITY SERVICE GENERALLY.
   The City, through the City Manager, shall furnish water to persons within

commercial main now is or may hereafter be laid, and may furnish water to
persons within its corporate limits whose premises do not abut a street or
alley in which a City commercial main now is or may hereafter be laid, as and
when, according to law, the City Manager may see fit to do so. The City, by
resolution of its Mayor and Council, shall have the authority to contract with
any person to sell water service beyond its corporate limits when, in the
judgment of the Mayor and Council, it is beneficial for the City to do so. The
City shall not incur any cost or expense in extending the means of such service
beyond its existing mains. Service shall not be instituted or continued except
to the extent that the facilities of the City for supplying water services are
in excess of the requirements of the inhabitants of the City.
(Ord. 935. Passed 1-22-79.)
1042.04  APPLICATION FOR SERVICE.
   Every person desiring a supply of water from the waterworks system of the

application for water service.
(1958 Code § 27.4; Ord. 358. Passed 1-6-50.)
1042.05  SERVICE CONTRACT.
   The rules, regulations and rates named in this chapter shall be considered a
part of every contract for water between a consumer and the City. Without
further formality, the making of application on the part of any applicant or
the use or consumption of water service by present consumers thereof and the
furnishing of water service to an applicant or consumer by the City shall
constitute a contract between the applicant or consumer and the City, to which
contract both parties are bound. If the consumer violates any of the provisions
of the contract or any reasonable rules and regulations that the City Manager
may adopt, the City Manager or his agent may cut off or disconnect the water
service from the building or premises or place of such violation and no further
connection for water service to such building, premises or place shall again be
made, save or except by order of the City Manager or his agent.
   Contracts for water service are not transferable. Any person wishing to
change from one location to another shall make a new application and sign a new
contract.
(1958 Code § 27.5)
1042.06  SERVICE DEPOSIT.
   An applicant for water who is a tenant or occupant and not the owner of the
premises to be served shall be required to accompany his application with a

applicant's premises at the cost or expense of the applicant.
   Every plumber to whom a permit is issued shall return the same to the office
of the City Manager for the records of the City Inspector. Such permit shall be
accurately filled out to include all details and information required.

the necessary tap or opening in the commercial main of the City. Tapping the
main and construction in the street from the commercial main to the stop box
shall be done by the City and a licensed plumber, at the expense of the
applicant, to bring water service from the stop box to and upon the premises of
the applicant. No person except the City Manager or his agent designated for

for in this chapter, regardless of whether a long or short tap is necessary,
tap the commercial main to which the applicant's service pipe will be joined,
shall furnish the ferrules or clamps and corporation cocks and put the same in
the commercial main and shall furnish and install supply pipe, trenching, labor
and all attachments to bring water service from the commercial main in the
street to a point at or near the property line where the stop box is placed, if
the applicant's property abuts a street where a commercial main is laid. If the
applicant's property does not abut a street where a commercial main is laid,
the applicant shall, at his own expense, to be paid as and when the Mayor and
Council provide by resolution, construct and bring water service from a point
at or near the property line on the street where there is a commercial main and
where the stop box is placed to his own premises, regardless of the distance
from the stop box located as aforesaid.
(Ord. 358. Passed 1-6-50.)
1042.11  TAP-IN CHARGES.
   (a)   Each applicant for water service within the City shall pay, in
advance, a tap fee which shall equal the cost of tapping the commercial main,

service to nonresidents, unless it is able to do so without curtailing the
demands of resident consumers or without overloading its pumps, machinery or
other equipment.
   (b)   Moneys received by the City for tap-in charges under this section,
unless otherwise provided, shall be credited to the Water Operation and

   All costs of extending a commercial main sufficient in size to accommodate
the development, but in no case smaller than six inches in diameter, plus
necessary valves and fireplugs, shall be assessed against the property thus
improved in proportion to the frontage abutting such improvement.
   In case the City deems it advisable to install an extension larger than six
inches for reasons of improving pressure or service on its system, the
additional costs over and above the cost of a six-inch main shall be borne by
the City.
(Ord. 358. Passed 1-6-50.)
1042.16  INSTALLATION OF SERVICES IN NEW PAYING DISTRICTS.
   In all new paving districts within the City all water services must be

1042.17  METERS GENERALLY.
   Water meters shall be placed in a substantial frostproof meter housing or
pit to be located at or near the inner line of the sidewalk on the applicant's
property, provided, however, that water meters may be placed in basements or

City Manager is convinced that the water meters so placed will be properly
protected and conveniently set for reading the same. Water meters required for
measuring water used by the applicant or consumer shall be furnished by the
City and all meters so furnished shall be the property of the City.
(Ord. 358. Passed 1-6-50.)
1042.18  DAMAGE TO METERS BY CONSUMERS.
   If a water consumer permits or allows the water meter to be damaged, injured
or destroyed through his own recklessness, carelessness or neglect so that the
meter must necessarily be repaired or replaced, the City Manager shall bill and
collect from such consumer the cost of such meter repair or replacement the
same as water rent. Permitting a water meter, not surrendered to the City, to

negligence on the part of the consumer.
(1958 Code § 27.18)
1042.19  SETTING AND SEALING METERS.
   Water meters shall be so set that the dial or face of the meter is easily

through the meter or, while passing through the meter, cause the same to
register inaccurately. If any water meter is found to have been tampered with,
the water rent shall be estimated for the rental period and the meter shall be
repaired and tested. Upon the repetition of the offense, it shall be optional
with the City Manager to discontinue the water service or to collect the amount
estimated to be due.

1042.41  EMERGENCY RESTRICTIONS ON USE; IRRIGATION.
   (a)   The City hereby finds that excessive irrigation in the Lodgepole
Valley and Sidney Draw west and north of Sidney periodically results in a
shortage of water available for recharge of City wells; that such shortage
jeopardizes the health and welfare of all citizens of the City; that shortages
may threaten domestic use resources and will cause a potentially hazardous
condition to exist for fire control. The purpose of this section is to restrict
the use of water resources in times of emergency to minimize the impact of such
a shortage and conserve available water to protect essential services.
   (b)   Except when under the emergency restrictions as set out in subsection
(b)(3) below, during the irrigation season of April 1 to October l of each
year, the irrigation or watering of lawns and/or gardens within the City
corporate limits is restricted to twice a week but without any hour
restrictions on permitted days as follows:
      (1)   Except as set out in subsection (c) below, watering or irrigation
of lawns and/or gardens within the area bounded by the Union Pacific Railroad
on the north and Summit Drive on the south and West of 11th Avenue from Summit
Drive to where 11th Avenue intersects the Burlington Northern Railroad and
north of the Burlington Northern Railroad from 11th and Osage to where the
Burlington Northern Railroad intersects the Union Pacific Railroad is permitted
on Tuesday and Saturday of each week but no person will water lawns and/or
gardens in the described area on any other days of the week.
      (2)   Except as set out in subsection (c) below, watering or irrigation
of lawns and/or gardens in all other locations within the City but not within
the boundaries above-described in subsection (a) which includes properties
North of the Union Pacific Railroad, South of Summit Drive or East of the
above-described boundaries is permitted on Sunday and Wednesday of each week
but no person will water lawns and/or gardens on said properties on any other
days of the week.
      (3)   All property of the City of Sidney will be watered on Monday and
Thursday of each week except that the watering of greens and tee areas on
Hillside Golf Course is permitted on a daily basis.
   (c)   Under emergency conditions in which a City water well reaches critical
low levels which is defined as a draw-down level of ten (10) feet or less of
water remaining in at least one City well, lawn and/or garden watering and
irrigation is restricted immediately. In that event, lawn watering is
restricted to once a week for restricted hours on a zone schedule designated by
the City Manager. The City Manager, or in his or her absence the Mayor, on the
notification of the Water Superintendent, will issue notification of watering
restrictions specifying zone designation and restricted hours permitted for
watering/irrigation to all private citizens and businesses of the City, via the
Police Division, to the Cable Television Emergency Broadcast System and KSID
Radio Station. The City Manager may, in case of emergency, also restrict water
usage in any other manner deemed necessary for the protection and conservation
of water on a temporary basis. The City Manager will present any such
additional emergency restrictions to the Council at the next regular or a
special meeting in Ordinance form, for consideration by Council. Additional
watering of new lawns, treated lawns and golf course may be permitted by the
City Manager to avoid damage to such areas.

1042.43  BACKFLOW/BACKSIPHONAGE PREVENTION.
   (a)   Findings; Purpose.  The City hereby finds that backflow and
backsiphonage of contaminants into a public water supply system can be a threat
to public health and safety. Direct or indirect cross-connections within a
water distribution system, including within a water customer's water
distribution system, are among possible structural arrangements which can
result in backflow and backsiphonage. In the interests of public health and
safety, the City hereby adopts the following backflow and backsiphonage
prevention program and crossconnection control program.
   (b)   Declaration of Nuisance
   (c)   Unlawful Connections; New Installations and Repairs
      (1)   That a cross-connection shall exist;
      (2)   That it will be possible in any manner to allow the flow of any
water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into the water supply system
other than the intended water, liquids, mixtures or substances of the public
water supply system; or
      (3)   That it will be possible, in any manner, to allow the flowing back
of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into the water supply system
due to negative pressure in the water distribution system.
   (d)   Prevention Devices Required.
      (1)   Premises having an auxiliary water supply;
      (2)   Premises in which, in the opinion of the City Manager, substances
are handled in a manner as to create an actual or potential hazard to the
public water supply;
      (3)   Premises having existing or potential internal cross-connections;
      (4)   Premises where, in the opinion of the City Manager, it is
impossible or impractical to make a complete cross-connection premises survey;
or
      (5)   Premises having more than one customer service pipe.
   (e)   Minimum Protection Requirements. When backflow or backsiphonage
prevention devices are required by this section, the prevention devices shall
provide a minimum level of protection as indicated in the following chart:

*For backflow or backsiphonage
   However, when, in the opinion of the City Manager or his or her authorized
representative, a different level of protection would be more appropriate, the
City Manager or his or her authorized representative shall prescribe the method
of backflow or backsiphonage protection.
   (f)   Installation and Inspection of Services. The City Manager or his or
her authorized representative, at the expense of the Municipality, may inspect
any premises to determine if a backflow device is required and what level of
protection will be necessary to protect the public health and safety.
   In order to inspect a premises, the City Manager or his or her authorized
representative shall give notice setting forth a proposed date and time to the
customer, at least ten working days in advance, by first class mail, return
receipt requested. If the customer cannot make the premises available for
inspection on that date and time, the customer shall contact the City Manager
or his or her authorized representative to arrange another date and time for
inspection. If the City Manager or his or her authorized representative and the
customer cannot agree on a date and time for inspection, a crossconnection
survey for such premises shall be deemed impossible or impractical and a
backflow or backsiphonage device shall be installed pursuant to subsection (e)
hereof. All inspections shall be at reasonable times.
   (g)   New Meter Installation.  All backflow and backsiphonage prevention
devices shall be installed in such a manner that the devices shall be
accessible.

authorized representative. If testing shall require entry into the premises,
the City Manager or his or her authorized representative shall give notice,
setting forth a proposed date and time to the customer, at least ten working
days in advance, by first class mail, return receipt requested. If the customer
cannot make the premises available for inspection on that date and time, the
customer shall contact the City Manager or his or her authorized representative
to arrange another date and time.
(Ord. 1450. Passed 9-26-00.)
   (j)   Authority of Manager or Authorized Representative.  The City Manager
or his or her authorized representative shall have the authority to issue any

1042.44  PRIVATE WATER WELLS WITHIN CITY; PROHIBITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS.
   (a)   The use of private water wells within the City negatively impacts the
well levels of the City's municipal wells and creates point source locations
for potential contamination of the public water supply. As a consequence of low
draw-down levels, some municipal wells have been shut down and water usage by
City residents and businesses restricted. It serves the public interest to
eliminate, to the extent possible, locations of possible point source
contamination. Additionally, a reduction in municipal water supply affects the
health, safety and welfare of all City residents and businesses to the extent
that it impacts availability of drinking water, sanitation and fire protection.
Therefore, the drilling, construction and use of new private water wells should
be and hereby is prohibited, and the use of private water wells presently
operating within the City is restricted.
   (b)   No private water or other wells shall be permitted or drilled or
constructed within the City limits.
   (c)   Private water wells within the City limits completed and continuously
operating year to year on or before August 1, 2002 may continue to operate if
continuously metered for the same purpose and capacity, except that in times of
declared water shortage emergency, all uses other than domestic or agricultural
use will cease except as permitted in division (e) of this section. Pumping to
fountains and ponds is deemed non-essential.
   (d)   During a declared water shortage emergency, the hours of pumping and
amount of water pumped from private wells within the City for agricultural
purposes may be restricted pursuant to a restriction plan adopted by resolution
of Council to ensure domestic supply to all City wells. Well owners will be
given notice of the hearing at which the restriction plan resolution will be
considered.
   (e)   During a declared water emergency all private water well owners will
observe the same day/hour lawn irrigation restrictions imposed upon city
municipal water users and will comply with any other emergency water
restrictions as are imposed upon other City residents generally.
(Ord. 1496.  Passed 9-24-02.)

1046.01  ADJUSTMENT OF RATES; EFFECTIVE PERIOD.
   The rates associated with providing natural gas service to residential,
commercial and noncontract customers located in the City of Sidney, Nebraska
(hereinafter "the City"), may be adjusted upward and shall be adjusted downward
to reflect changes in K N Energy, Inc.'s (hereinafter "KNE") unbundled gas
supply costs in accordance with the following provisions effective on and after
the date KNE implements the unbundling of residential sales service under its
Nebraska Choice Gas Transportation Terms and Conditions.
(Ord. 1379. Passed 3-10-98.)
1046.02  UNRECOVERED FERC ACCOUNT 191 CHARGE.
   (a)   The charges made by KNE for gas delivered to its customers shall be
subject to adjustment to recover or refund the over- or under-collected
deferred gas costs in Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Account 191.
Upon the effective date of Sections 1046.01 to 1046.06, and each year
thereafter, KNE will establish an Account 191 Charge to be effective the
following year. The applicable Account 191 Charge shall be computed using the
following formula:
   JA191 / (PJAD x TY) = Account 191 Charge
Where:
JA191 = Projected Nebraska total system FERC Account 191 Balance
PJAD = Projected Nebraska total system annual deliveries stated in therms
TY = Term of Account 191 Charge in years, which shall be two years for the
first effective year under Sections
1046.01 to
1046.06, and one year thereafter.
   (b)   The Projected Nebraska total system FERC Account 191 Balance shall
include such deferred costs that are incurred prior or subsequent to the
effective date of Sections
1046.01 to
1046.06, which resulted from the following:
      (1)   Under-or over-collections of the cost of gas purchases made by KNE
for the purpose of providing gas supply to customers prior to the
implementation of the unbundling of residential sales service.
      (2)   Incurrence of gas supply costs after the implementation of the
unbundling of residential sales service due to: A. Participating suppliers not
performing per the Nebraska Choice Gas Transportation Terms and Conditions; B.
Participating suppliers terminating their participation during the Nebraska
Choice Gas Transportation program year; or C. Lack of full assignment of
interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity by KNE to suppliers.
Such capacity shall have been acquired and retained in a prudent manner for the
purposes of reliably serving customers' daily and annual load requirements, and
new capacity acquired or capacity retained shall be solely for the purpose of
serving those customers for which firm upstream capacity is required under the
residential and commercial unbundling program.
      Such costs under paragraphs (b) (2)A. and B. hereof shall be collected
through this mechanism only after recovery directly from the associated
supplier has been reasonably pursued.
   (c)   The Projected Nebraska total system FERC Account 191 Balance shall
also include interest, computed in accordance with subsection (e) hereof.
   (d)   As used in this chapter, the terms "gas purchases" and "gas supply
costs" include the total dollar demand and commodity cost of gas purchases made
by KNE and all associated gathering, transporting, storing, treating,
processing or any other services, fees and taxes related to such gas purchases.
Such costs are typically recorded in FERC Accounts 800, 801, 802, 803, 804,
806, and 808 or other similar accounts.
   (e)   Interest will be calculated on any over- or under-recovered amounts at
a rate equal to the then-current rate of interest on pipeline refunds, as
published by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Interest will be
calculated monthly by applying the interest rate to the beginning of the month
balance of over- or under-recovered gas costs as recorded in FERC Account 191,
less accumulated deferred income taxes. Any accumulated interest amounts will
be added to or subtracted from the Jurisdictional FERC Account 191 Balance and
become a part of that balance to be collected through the Account 191 Charge.
   (f)   The Account 191 Charge shall be reflected in rates only when it
represents a dollar amount equal to at least $.001 per delivered therm. Between
annual filing periods, if KNE experiences a change or changes in projected
delivered therms or Nebraska total system FERC Account 191 Balance, and the
cumulative effect of those changes is to produce a projected increase or
decrease in the effective Account 191 Charge of at least $.001 per delivered
therm for the remaining portion of the rate effective period, then an adjusted
Account 191 Charge may be determined and charged.
   (g)   The annual Account 191 Charge shall become effective thirty days
subsequent to the mailing of written notice. Such written notice shall include
supporting work-papers which state the Nebraska total system FERC Account 191
Balance and which support the calculation of the applicable Account 191 Charge.
(Ord. 1379. Passed 3-10-98.)
1046.03  OTHER GAS SUPPLY CHARGES.
   (a)   The charges which KNE makes for gas delivered to its customers shall
be subject to adjustment to recover certain costs associated with KNE's gas
supply contract P-0802 (hereinafter the "P-0802 Charge") and its Gas Supply
Transition Agreement (hereinafter the "GSTA Charge"). The P-0802 Charge and the
GSTA Charge shall be calculated in total for Nebraska and applied uniformly to
all of KNE's Nebraska rate areas. Nothing herein precludes the Municipality
from exercising its statutory authority to approve an ordinance adopting
revisions to KNE's unbundling program or this chapter and the charges provided
for herein.
   (b)   Upon the first effective day of this chapter, and each year
thereafter, the P-0802 Charge shall be computed on a unit-of-delivery
methodology, based on the Nebraska portion of the projected difference between
the purchase costs associated with contract P-0802 purchase obligations and the
revenues recovered by KNE, or a subsidiary of KNE, through resale of such
volumes at market prices, divided by projected Nebraska customer delivered
volumes for the upcoming twelve-month period. P-0802 purchase costs shall
include costs associated with contract P-0802 which are transferred out of
Account 165 due to physical deliveries associated with such costs. In the
alternative, the P-0802 Charge shall be computed on a unit-of-delivery
methodology based on the Nebraska portion of a negotiated P-0802 contract
buyout amount divided by projected total Nebraska customer delivered volumes
for a period to be determined by KNE.
   In addition, an amount shall be added to or subtracted from the P-0802
Charge to represent a reconciliation from the prior twelve-month period between
revenues KNE collected under the P-0802 Charge and actual net costs incurred by
KNE for Contract P-0802.
   (c)   Upon the first effective date of this chapter, and continuing for a
three-year period, the GSTA Charge shall be computed on a unit-of-delivery
methodology, based on the Nebraska portion of the projected difference between
the purchase costs associated with the GSTA contract and the revenues recovered
by KNE, or a subsidiary of KNE, through resale of such volumes at market
prices, and projected total Nebraska customer delivered volumes for the
upcoming twelve-month period. In the alternative, the GSTA Charge shall be
computed on a unit-of-delivery methodology based on the Nebraska portion of a
negotiated GSTA contract buyout divided by projected total Nebraska customer
delivered volumes for a period to be determined by KNE.
   In addition, an amount shall be added to or subtracted from the GSTA Charge
to represent a reconciliation from the prior twelve-month period between
revenues KNE collected under the GSTA Charge and actual net costs incurred by
KNE for the GSTA contract. This adjustment for reconciliation shall also apply
one year following the completion of the GSTA Charge application.
   (d)   The portion of Contract P-0802 and the GSTA Contract which is
applicable to Nebraska will be calculated as an allocated share of such
contracts based upon annual projected volumes delivered to Nebraska divided by
projected applicable systemwide delivered volumes.
   (e)   The P-0802 and GSTA Charges shall be reflected in rates only when they
represent a dollar amount equal to at least $.001 per delivered therm. Between
annual filing periods, if KNE experiences a change or changes in the projected
costs or revenues, and the cumulative effect of these changes is to produce a
projected increase or decrease in the effective rate of at least $.001 per
therm for the remaining portion of the projected period, then an adjusted P-
0802 or GSTA Charge may be determined and charged.
   (f)   The annual P-0802 and GSTA Charges shall become effective thirty days
subsequent to the mailing of written notice. Such written notice shall include
supporting work-papers which state the projected P-0802 and GSTA purchase costs
and sale revenues or buyout costs, and which support the calculation of the
applicable P-0802 and GSTA Charges.
(Ord. 1379. Passed 3-10-98.)
1046.04  DISCOUNTING.
   If and when KNE discounts its service in order to maintain or increase
system load, the components of the currently applicable rates shall be
discounted in the following order: first, Account 191 Charge, P-0802 Charge and
GSTA Charge; and second, Base Rates. In providing discounts, KNE shall not
grant any undue preference or unjust discounts.
(Ord. 1379. Passed 3-10-98.)
1046.05  GAS SUPPLY CHOICE; PARTICIPATION OF SUPPLIERS; NO SPECIAL PREFERENCE;
MUNICIPAL OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE; RIGHT OF CITY TO REVISE.
   KNE's unbundling program will provide all customers with gas supply choice
at the customer level. All residential customers shall be served with upstream
firm transport and storage. Suppliers who wish to participate in the unbundling
program must qualify under and sign the Supplier Participation Agreement. KNE
will give no undue preference as to rates or services, make or grant any
unreasonable preference or advantage to any person or subject any person to any
unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage. A Municipal Oversight Committee shall
be created to assist in an advisory capacity. Such Committee may make
recommendations regarding changes and the administration of KNE's unbundling
program and shall have the capacity to audit KNE's compliance with its
unbundling program. Nothing herein precludes the Municipality from exercising
its statutory authority to approve an ordinance adopting revisions to KNE's
unbundling program.
(Ord. 1379. Passed 3-10-98.)
1046.06  CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS.
   (a)   Pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. 84-712.05, all records received by any
representative from the Municipality serving on the Municipal Oversight
Committee which are proprietary in nature and which would give advantage to
business competitors, or personally identified citizen account payment
information, credit information, or customer lists, or any other nonpublic
information received, shall be information withheld from the public.
   (b)   Pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. 84-712.05, all records received by any
representative from the Municipality for purpose of exercising its regulatory
responsibilities pursuant to its statutory authority, which are reasonably
determined by the Municipality to be proprietary in nature and which would give
advantage to business competitors, or personally identified citizen account
payment information, credit information, or customer lists, or any other
nonpublic information received, shall be information withheld from the public.
(Ord. 1379. Passed 3-10-98.)
1046.07  RATE FILING FEE.
   The City shall charge and collect a rate filing fee of one thousand dollars
($1,000) from any utility desiring to change its rates for natural gas service
other than to reflect an adjustment for natural gas supply costs. The rate
filing fee set forth herein is effective retroactive to June 4, 1987.
(Ord. 1112. Passed 12-12-87.)
1046.08  NATURAL GAS RATES; CUSTOMER CHARGE FOR TAXES IMPOSED ON COMPANY.

similar tax of any kind on the Company, the amounts thereof, insofar as
practical, shall be charged on a pro rata basis to all applicable customers
receiving gas service from the Company within the City. This charge, in all
cases, will be in addition to the regular charges for gas service. Where such
tax is levied on a percentage of gross receipts from customers or a class of
customers, such percentage will be applied to each affected customer's bill,
and the amount so computed will be added to such bill. The amount of the tax
charged to each affected customer in each billing period will be shown as a
separate item on the customer's bill and identified as such.

horsepower for each calendar year or fraction thereof.  Such charge is for
demand only, and no energy is to be received for the amount paid.
   (d)   Ratchet Charge.  The connected load in horsepower will be taken from
the nameplate rating of the motor.  If the City has reason to believe that the
connected load is in excess of the nameplate rating, the load will be
measured.  If it is found to be in excess, the actual load will be used to
determine the minimum bill.  Where nameplates of the motors are not available,
the horsepower connected will be determined by an actual measurement of
horsepower input to the motor operating under maximum load conditions.  The
City reserves the right to check the customer’s load for recalculation of the
total bill at any time.
   (e)   Production Cost Adjustment.  There shall be added, as applicable, a
production cost adjustment, as provided in Section
1048.07.
   (f)   Power Factor Correction.  A deficient power factor shall be corrected
by the customer, as provided in Section

   (a)   Definitions.  As used in this section:
      (1)   "Avoided costs" means the incremental costs to an electric utility
of electric energy or capacity, or both, which, if not for the purchase thereof
from qualifying facilities, such utility would generate itself or purchase from
another source.
      (2)   "Cogeneration facility" means a facility which produces electric
energy and steam or other forms of useful energy (such as heat) which are used
for industrial, commercial, heating or cooling purposes.
      (3)   "Interconnection costs" means the reasonable costs of connection,
switching, metering, transmission, distribution, safety provisions and
administration incurred by the electric utility, which costs are directly
related to the installation and maintenance of the physical facilities
necessary to permit interconnected operations with a qualifying facility, to
the extent such costs are in excess of the corresponding costs which the
electric utility would have incurred if it had not engaged in interconnected
operations but instead generated an equivalent amount of electric energy itself
or purchased an equivalent amount of electric energy or capacity from other
sources. Interconnection costs do not include any costs involved in the
calculation of avoided costs.
      (4)   "Qualifying cogeneration facility" means a cogeneration facility
that meets the requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
regarding ownership, fuel use and operating and efficiency standards.
      (5)   "Qualifying small power production facility" means a small power
production facility that meets the requirements of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission regarding ownership, fuel use, fuel efficiency and
reliability.
      (6)   "Small power production facility" means a facility which produces
electric energy solely by the use, as a primary energy source, of biomass,
waste, renewable resources or any combination thereof totaling not more than
eighty megawatts at one site.
   (b)   Application for Interconnection Standards Costs.
      (1)   Qualifying facilities wishing to interconnect with the electric
system of the City shall make application to the Utility Department for such
interconnection. Applicants shall use such forms as are prescribed by the City
and shall furnish all information requested.
      (2)   The City shall establish reasonable standards to be met by
qualifying facilities to ensure system safety and the reliability of
interconnected operations. Such standards may include, but shall not be limited
to, the following areas: power factor; voltage regulation; fault, overcurrent
and over-under voltage protection; harmonics; synchronization; and isolation.
Interconnection costs associated with the interconnection with a qualifying
facility shall be paid by such qualifying facility. Qualifying facilities shall
be required to execute contractual agreements with the City before any
interconnection is established.
   (c)   Rates for Sale of Energy. Rates for the sale of electric energy to a
qualifying facility shall be those current standard rates adopted from time to
time by resolution of the Mayor and Council which apply to other customers of
the utility in the same classification of electric service.
   (d)   Rates for Purchase of Energy.
      (1)   Rates for the purchase of electric energy from qualifying
facilities shall be established by resolution of the Mayor and Council.
      (2)   Such rates shall be just and reasonable to the electric consumer of
the utility and in the public interest, shall not discriminate against
qualifying cogeneration and small power production facilities and shall be
related to avoided costs. However, in no case shall the utility be required to
pay more than the avoided costs.
      (3)   Standard rates shall be established for purchases of electric
energy from qualifying facilities with a design capacity of 100 kilowatts or
less. Rates for purchases from qualifying facilities with a design capacity
over 100 kilowatts may be standard rates or may be by individual contracts, the
terms of which are fair and reasonable.

Ch. 1228
1076.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to assure that all subdivisions or other land
development in the City, and its jurisdiction, are adequately designed with
storm drainage facilities that will control the adverse impacts associated with
increased storm water.
(Ord. 1699.  Passed 8-27-13.)
1076.02   DESIGN.
   (a)   All subdivisions or other land development shall have a storm water
management system that is adequately designed and constructed by the subdivider
or developer to provide for the proper drainage of surface water of the
subdivision or development and the drainage area of which it is a part.  The
storm water management system shall be adequate to prevent the undue or
unplanned retention of storm water on the site and prevent undue or unplanned
damage to adjacent property either upstream or downstream of the proposed
subdivision or development.
   (b)   The design of the storm water management system shall be consistent
with general and specific concerns and standards of the Comprehensive
Development Plan, East Sidney Watershed Report and the drainage control
programs of applicable public agencies.  Designs shall be based on
environmentally sound site planning and engineering techniques.
   (c)   To the maximum degree possible, drainage from subdivisions shall
conform to natural contours of land and not disturb pre-existing drainageways.
   (d)   Adjacent properties or the drainage area of which the development is a
part shall not be unduly burdened with surface water from the subdivision or
other land development.  Specifically:
      (1)   There may be no unreasonable impediment of water from higher
adjacent properties across the subdivision or land development, causing damage
to lower properties.  No action shall unreasonably collect and channel storm
water onto lower properties.  The peak rate of post-development runoff based on
the intensity of a ten year design storm shall not exceed the peak rate of pre-
development runoff.  The City reserves the right to include volumetric controls
for runoff from a proposed development in instances where such controls are
necessary.  For example, if post-development runoff volume from a proposed
development exceeds the capacity of a downstream detention cell, the City
reserves the right to require the proposed development to reduce post-
development runoff through implementation of retention cells or other
acceptable storm water management practices, as determined necessary by the
Public Services Director, and is to be managed in a manner consistent with
State statutes and existing case law regarding such flows.
   (e)   Design shall use the best available technology to minimize off-site
runoff, encourage natural filtration, simulate natural drainage, and minimize
discharge of pollutants.  Best available technology may include such items as
detention cells, retention basins, swales, porous paving, terracing and other
similar engineering solutions.  Storm water may be detained on a per lot basis,
per subdivision basis or in a regional facility that serves the drainage basin.
   (f)   All storm water management facilities shall be designed by a State
licensed engineer.  All storm water management plans submitted to the City
shall be signed and stamped by the designing engineer.
   (g)   No surface water shall be channeled into a sanitary sewer system.
   (h)   Where possible, a subdivision's or land development's drainage system
shall coordinate with that of surrounding properties or streets.
   (i)   All storm water designs shall be reviewed and approved by the Public
Services Director.  The plat submissions and or development submittals must
include Public Works Plans including preliminary drainage computations and
demonstrations that the proposed storm water management system meets the
requirements of this section.
   (j)   The location of all storm water management facilities and associated
easements shall be clearly labeled on the final plat.
   (k)   Final engineering design and drainage computations must be approved by
the Public Services Director prior to the commencement of any type of
development construction or the issuance of any building permits for any lot
within the subdivision or other land development.
   (l)   The subdivider/developer shall provide adequate drainage facilities
within the subdivision or other land development to provide for the adequate
disposal of subsurface and surface water as determined to be necessary by the
Public Services Director, including recommendations from the Planning
Commission.
      (1)   Drainage facilities shall include underground pipe, inlets, catch
basins, open drainage ditches, culverts and/or bridges, intersectional drains,
drop inlets, headwalls, curb, gutter, bio-cells and similar or related
installations.
      (2)   Storm water shall be conveyed to an approved storm drainage system
if available and adequate to accept the runoff from the fully developed
subdivision or other land development.  "Available" shall mean a system
approved by the Public Services Director to serve the proposed subdivision or
other land development that is within 300 feet; the subdivider/developer shall
construct a storm drainage system and connect with such storm drainage system.
      (3)   If an approved storm drainage system is available but not of
adequate capacity, then provisions must be made for on-site detention to reduce
the peak flow out of the subdivision to that which the approved system can
accommodate.
      (4)   If such a storm drainage system is not available, natural drainage
channels with easements of adequate width shall be provided, as determined by
the Public Services Director, including recommendations from the Planning
Commission.
(Ord. 1699.  Passed 8-27-13.)
1076.03   EROSION CONTROL.
   (a)   The subdivider/developer shall be required to provide for the control
of erosion of the areas of the subdivision or other land development which are
disturbed by the development.
   (b)   The subdivider/developer shall submit a storm water pollution and
prevention plan (SWPPP) as required by the State for all construction sites
that disturb greater than one acre of land or which are part of a larger common
plan of development that disturbs greater than one acre and obtain a
construction site to waters NPDES permit.  The subdivider/developer shall also
submit the required SWPPP to the City for review and approval.  No construction
activities shall take place prior to approval of the SWPPP by the State and
City.
   (c)   Measures to control erosion may include temporary terraces on slopes,
temporary silting basins, sod swales and spillways, and whatever may be
necessary to prevent erosion and damage to adjacent properties from surface
drainage as approved by the State and City.
(Ord. 1699.  Passed 8-27-13.)
1076.04   FEES.
   (a)   The City reserves the right to have all storm water plans,
specifications and calculations reviewed by a third party State licensed
engineer as selected by the Public Services Director. Such cost for review
shall be paid solely by the developer.
   (b)   A storm water management and maintenance fee shall apply to all lots
platted after the effective date of this chapter. This fee shall apply to lots
within the corporate boundaries of the City and within the two-mile zoning
jurisdiction of the City. This fee shall be paid by either the developer at the
time of submission of a final plat or by the individual building on such lot at
the time of application of a building permit. If the latter is chosen by the
developer, then such language shall be included in the subdivides agreement.
The fee shall be applied to each lot, categorized as either residential or
commercial, as set out in the Master Fee Schedule of the City of Sidney.
(Ord. 1699.  Passed 8-27-13; Ord. 1800. Passed 9-25-18.)
1076.05   CONSTRUCTION.
   Construction activities on any lot shall comply with this chapter, SWPPP or
the following regulations if the construction site does not meet the State
requirements for the filing of a SWPPP.
   (a)    Sediment control measures shall be in place and comply with the SWPPP
filed by the original subdivider or land developer.  Under no circumstances
shall sediment be allowed to wash onto adjacent property, streets, alleys or
any other property.
   (b)   Owner or contractor shall sign an agreement acknowledging they will
comply with all terms and conditions of the SWPPP.  Violation of the SWPPP will
result in immediate suspension of the building permit and other penalties as
listed in Section
1076.06.
   (c)   Owner or contractor shall not regrade the lot so that the original lot
grading is changed from that as in the subdivision or land development plans as
approved by the City.  Any change to the lot grading will result in an
immediate suspension of the building permit.  Corrections to the grading shall
be completed immediately at the sole expense of the owner.  Failure to comply
shall result in penalties as listed in Section
1076.06.
   (d)   Owner or contractor shall be solely responsible for all costs and work
required to correct damage to other properties affected by failing to comply
with this chapter.
(Ord. 1699.  Passed 8-27-13.)
1076.06   PENALTY.
   (a)   Failure of the owner/developer/contractor to comply with this chapter
shall result in an immediate suspension of all development work and/or
construction.  Such work shall cease until all required corrections have been
made to the satisfaction of the City and/or Engineer.  In addition to the work
suspension the City may impose a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day
for each day of non-compliance.
   (b)   The owner/developer/contractor shall be solely liable for all costs
and work required to correct damage to adjacent property, streets, alleys or
any other property that is damaged by a failure to comply with this chapter.
   (c)   Failure to comply with items listed in Section 1076.05 shall result in
a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day for each day of non-compliance
in addition to suspension of building permit.
(Ord. 1699.  Passed 8-27-13.)
1076.07   MAINTENANCE.
   (a)   The City shall maintain all portions of the storm water system that
have been accepted as part of the public system.
   (b)   Routine and ongoing maintenance of all storm water management
facilities constructed on private property after the date of passage of this
chapter is required as set forth in this section.  The term "maintenance" is
herein defined as including, but not limited to, the following situations:
erosion, sedimentation, plant growth in excess of 12 inches high, removal of
undesirable animal infestation, litter control, compliance with State dam
inspections, and any other related issues the City or State may request.
   (c)   For storm water facilities that serve more than one lot, the owner(s)
of each lot in the subdivision/development shall derive benefit from the storm
water facilities in controlling storm water runoff and therefore each and every
property owner in the subdivision shall collectively and proportionally be
responsible for all costs associated with ongoing maintenance of the storm
water facilities within the subdivision/development in perpetuity.  The
proportionate share shall be determined based on the total amount of land area
each owns on a square foot basis as compared to the collective total square
footage of the benefited properties.
   (d)   The aforementioned maintenance requirements shall be set forth in
detail as part of the required subdividers agreement prepared in conjunction
with the final plat for the subdivision or other land development with said
agreement incorporated by reference on the final plat filed of record with the
final plat at the Register of Deeds of the County.
   (e)   Upon verification that maintenance is required for a given storm water
facility, the City shall give written notice, as provided by law, to each
property owner, homeowners association or other entity responsible for said
maintenance informing said owner(s) that the required maintenance shall be
performed within 30 days of the date of notice.  In the event that maintenance
is not performed on private storm water facilities by the property owner(s) as
set forth in this section, the City reserves the right to enter the site and
perform the required maintenance or hire a private contractor to perform the
required maintenance, and to assess the cost of said maintenance to each
property owner, homeowners association or other entity that benefits from the
storm water facility.  The City reserves the right to assess these costs to
each property owner, homeowners association or other entity by any and all
legal manners afforded the City.  The assessments for this maintenance cost
will be based on the City fee schedule or if a private contractor is hired the
cost shall be the amount billed by the contractor plus a 5% City administrative
fee.  The City reserves the right to include an additional interest charge of
5% per month for any bill that is left unpaid for more than 30 days.

   A proposed subdivision of a lot, block or other tract of land shall not be
approved by Council unless and until a plat required by these Subdivision
Regulations is submitted to the Planning Commission and Council. Approval of
such subdivision shall be effected by approval of the plat by Council. However,
a proposed subdivision may be approved without a plat as provided in Section
1224.02.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1224.02  APPROVAL OF SUBDIVISIONS WITHOUT PLATS,
   (a)   Changing Boundary of Public Way. A proposed subdivision may be
approved without a plat thereof if such subdivision is for the sole purpose of
establishing or changing a boundary of a public way.
   (b)   Lot Boundary Changes. A proposed subdivision may be approved without a
plat thereof if such subdivision consists of a change of a boundary between two
adjoining lots on one or both of which are situated a building or buildings
which do not comply with minimum set-back requirements under
Chapter 1264 and if the purpose of the change is to effect, or more nearly
effect, compliance with such requirements. However, a change of a boundary
between two adjoining lots for the purpose of effecting, or more nearly
effecting, compliance with set-back requirements shall not be approved unless
Council finds that the owner of the lot when construction of the building was
commenced did not have knowledge of the noncompliance or of facts that should
have put him or her on inquiry in regard thereto.
   (c)   Adjoining Platted Lots. A proposed subdivision may be approved without
a plat thereof if such subdivision consists of a subdivision of three adjoining
platted lots into two adjoining unplatted lots.
   (d)   Conveyance for Completed Construction. A proposed subdivision may be
approved without a plat thereof if such subdivision is for the purpose of
making lawful the conveyance of a part of a lot, block or tract of land, which
would otherwise be or was accomplished in violation of prior Zoning Codes and
Subdivision Regulations, either in the original form or as amended, where a
building has been constructed on the same in accordance with a building permit
issued by the City Manager and where Council finds that the owner of the lot,
at the time of application for the building permit, fully disclosed all
pertinent facts.
   (e)   Conveyance Due to Construction Problems. A proposed subdivision may be
approved without a plat thereof if such subdivision is for the purpose of
making lawful the conveyance of a part of a lot, block or tract of land, which
would otherwise be or was accomplished in violation of prior Zoning Codes and
Subdivision Regulations, either in the original form of such section or as
amended, where the acquisition or conveyance of such part of a lot, block or
tract of land was made necessary by problems arising in the construction of a
building on adjoining property and where Council finds that the problems
arising in the construction of the building could not reasonably have been
anticipated before commencement of construction.
   (f)   Prior Existing Tracts. A proposed subdivision may be approved without
a plat thereof if such subdivision is of a lot into two or more tracts on each
of which there has existed since March 14, 1977, one or more residence
buildings. However, approval of such subdivision shall not entitle the owners
or occupants of such tracts to occupy or use the tracts if the occupancy or use
would be in violation of the Zoning Code, unless such persons first obtain from
the Planning Commission a special permit as provided in Section
1264.18.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1224.03  PURCHASE OF UNPLATTED PROPERTY.
   If the vendee under a written contract to purchase unplatted property from
the owner of record proposes to plat some or all of the property without the
vendor's signature upon the plat, Council nevertheless may approve such
subdivision, which would be effected by a deed of the property which the vendee
proposes to plat from the vendor to the vendee, if all the following conditions
are met:
   (a)   Prior to such approval, Council has approved a preliminary plat,
signed and acknowledged by the vendee, of all the property which is the subject
of the contract.
   (b)   Prior to or concurrent with Council's approval of the subdivision that
will be effected by the deed, Council has approved or approves a final plat,
signed and acknowledged by the vendee, covering all and only the property that
is the subject of the deed.
   (c)   Prior to or concurrent with the approval of such final plat by
Council, a warranty deed from the owner of record to the vendee conveying all
and only the property covered by the final plat (together with the recording
fee) is delivered to the Clerk-Treasurer for recording with the County Clerk.
The Clerk-Treasurer shall cause the deed so delivered to be filed with the
County Clerk for recording prior to filing the plat for recording.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)

1226.01  CONFORMITY WITH SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS AND ZONING CODE.
   A proposed subdivision shall comply in all respects with the requirements of
these Subdivision Regulations and the Zoning Code that are applicable to the
area.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1226.02  LOTS.
   (a)   Street Frontage; Dedications. Every lot in a subdivision shall abut
upon a street that has been dedicated to public use. Lots that abut upon an
arterial street may be required by Council to front upon a marginal access
street. No private street shall be platted. Council may require the platting
and dedication to public use of streets or alleys in a proposed subdivision to
provide access to and from lands, whether platted or unplatted, adjoining or
adjacent to such subdivision.
   (b)   Street Frontage; Lot Lines. Each lot shall front upon a public street.
Inside lot lines, insofar as practical, shall be perpendicular to a straight
street line or radial to a curved street line.
   (c)   Dimensions; Sewage; Parking. A residential lot served by a public
sewer shall be not less than sixty feet in width at the building lines, 100
feet in depth and 7,000 square feet in area. A residential lot not served by a
public sewer shall be not less than 100 feet in width at the building set-back
lines, 150 feet in depth, and, in any event, 20,000 square feet in area. All
types of lots not served by a public sewer shall contain an area adequate for
an approved type of septic tank and disposal field. A lot proposed to be used
for business, commercial or industrial purposes shall be of a size and
dimension that will permit the development of off-street service and parking
facilities appropriate to the use contemplated. However, the dimensions and
area of a lot shall not be less than are necessary in order to comply with the
requirements of these Subdivision Regulations that are applicable to such lot.
(Ord. 1049.  Passed 2-26-85; Ord. 1720.  Passed 2-11-14.)
1226.03  EXISTING STREETS.
   Existing arterial and collector streets outside a proposed subdivision that
end at a boundary line of such subdivision shall be extended through such
subdivision.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1226.04  STREETS AND ALLEYS.
   (a)   Width. The width of the right of way for streets and alleys in a
subdivision, if shown on a Master Street Plan adopted by Council, shall not be
less than that shown on such Plan. If the width of the right of way is not
shown on such Plan, the width shall not be less than the following:
   Street Type                  Width (ft.)
   Arterial               80 to 150, as required by Council
   Collector               60
   Marginal access            45
   Minor                  45
   Alley                  16
   Four-foot easements adjacent to the street right of way are required on
minor streets in blocks which have alleys. If the width of an existing arterial
or collector street that is to be extended through the subdivision exceeds the
required minimum width, the width of the extended part shall be not less than
the greater of the two widths. If the proposed subdivision abuts upon an
existing street, the right of way of which is not as wide as is required
herein, the owner shall dedicate to the public use as a street an adjoining
strip of land of such width that the street, thus widened, will comply with
this subsection. Council may approve a street of a lesser width if it finds
that topographical conditions or other physical conditions render impractical
the construction of a street of the width required by this subsection.
   (b)   Intersection Jogs; Centerline Curvature. No street jog at an
intersection shall have a centerline offset of less than 125 feet. If there
occurs a deflection angle of more than ten degrees in the alignment of a street
at a place other than an intersection, a curve of reasonably long radius shall
be provided. On a street of sixty or more feet in width, the radius of
curvature of the centerline shall be not less than 300 feet. On other streets,
such radius shall be not less than 100 feet. A tangent of not less than 100
feet in length shall be provided between reverse curves on arterial and
collector streets.
   (c)   Angle of Intersection; Curb Line Radius. An intersection of streets
shall be as nearly as practical at an angle of ninety degrees and in no event
less than sixty degrees. The radius of the curb line at a street intersection
shall be not less than twenty feet in length. If the angle of the intersection
is less than seventy-five degrees, the City may require a longer radius. Lot
lines shall be rounded or otherwise set back sufficiently to enable sidewalks
of normal width to be constructed.
   (d)   Grades. Grades on arterial and collector streets shall not exceed
seven percent, or, on other streets, ten percent. Changes in grade on arterial
or collector streets shall be connected by vertical curves of a length in feet
of not less than fifteen times the algebraic difference in rates of grade, and,
on other streets, not less than one-half of such length.
   (e)   Terminal; Turnarounds. Minor terminal streets or courts designed to
have one end permanently closed shall not exceed 400 feet in length. The closed
end shall have a turn-around with a diameter of the right of way of not less
than 100 feet and with an outside diameter of the roadway of not less than
eighty feet. Where the closed end of a proposed street will abut upon unplatted
land, such end shall have a temporary turn-around with an outside diameter of
the roadway of not less than eighty feet.
   (f)   Naming. A proposed street that is substantially in alignment with an
existing named street shall bear the name of the existing street. However, no
street shall bear the name of any existing street that has been dedicated to
public use. This prohibition shall apply to the substitution of the word
street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place or court or of a like word, for a word
contained in the name of an existing street.
   (g)   Location of Alleys. An alley should be provided for every lot used or
proposed to" be used for business purposes. If an alley is not provided, then a
twelve-foot easement is required adjacent to the street right-of-way line on a
minor street.
   (h)   Conformity to Master Plan. As to all matters not specified by these
Subdivision Regulations, all streets and alleys shall conform to any Master
Street Plan that Council may adopt.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1226.05  PUBLIC SPACE.
   (a)   Requirements of Dedication. The Planning Commission, upon the
consideration of a proposed public or private dedication by a subdivides the
City Master Park Plan or the City Comprehensive Plan, all as applied to a
subdivision site under consideration, shall recommend to Council that the
subdivider be required to provide park sites and open spaces in the following
manner, as determined by the Commission or by Council when such sites are
reasonably necessary to serve the proposed subdivision and the future residents
thereof:
      (1)   Percentage dedication. Dedication of such sites and land areas to
the City or to the public, which dedication shall not exceed 8% of the total
gross area of the land within the proposed subdivision, as determined by the
Commission; or
      (2)   Dedication based on density. Dedication of such sites the amount of
which shall be based on the proposed density in the subdivision in accordance
with the following formula;
 
Percentage of Gross Area of the Subdivision Required When Net Density/Dwelling
Unit Park Land is Dedicated
1 D.U./acre or more 0.6%
2 D. U./acre 1.2%
      (3)   Fee in lieu of percentage dedication. In lieu of dedication
pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) hereof, at the discretion of Council, the
subdivider shall pay a sum of money not exceeding the full market value of such
sites and land as designated by the Commission. Such sums, when required, shall
be held by Council for the acquisition of such sites and land areas by the City
or by the appropriate public authority.
      (4)   Fee in lieu of dedication. In lieu of the dedication pursuant to
paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) hereof, at the discretion of Council, the subdivider
shall pay a sum of money equal to an amount per lot or dwelling unit where
multiple unit structures are proposed. Such amount shall be as set out in the
Master Fee Schedule of the City of Sidney. Sack sums, when required, shall be
held by Council for the acquisition of such sites and land areas by the City or
by the appropriate public authority.
      (5)   General fee in lieu. Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(3) hereof,
Council may require a fee in lieu of the dedication under either paragraph (a)
(1) or (a)(2) hereof, if the City Comprehensive Plan or the City Master Park
Plan recommends neighborhood open space to be located elsewhere than in the
immediate neighborhood comprehended by the proposed subdivision plat.
      (6)   Factors concerning amount of dedication. In determining the
requirements for school sites, open space or park space, the Commission and
Council shall consider the following;
         A.   Density and lot size of the proposed subdivision;
         B.   The location of the subdivision with respect to public open
space, such as State and County recreation areas; and
         C.   The private ownership and maintenance of the open space are
adequately provided for by written agreement and that the space is restricted
only to park and recreational purposes by recorded instruments.
   (b)   Consideration of Total Development Area. The Commission and Council
shall consider, when recommending provisions for sites and land areas for
schools, parks and open space, the total development area of the subdivider
involved, including the area of adjoining subdivisions, proposed subdivisions
or various filings of the same subdivision owned or being developed by the same
subdivides, his or her heirs, successors or assigns, and shall determine such
sites and land areas on the basis of the total development area and the
residents and future residents thereof, in which case the total dedication
shall not exceed eight percent of the total development area or shall not
exceed the area as determined by the density formula set forth in division (a)
(2) hereof for the total development area. However, such dedication may exceed
8 % or the density formula for the specific subdivision or filing involved.
   (c)   Determination of Market Value. Whenever the term "market value" or
"fair market value" is used in this section, such value shall be determined as
of the time of filing the final plat, based upon raw land value in accordance
with the following;
      (1)   The fair market value is determined by Council based upon the then
assessed value, modified to equal market value in accordance with current
practice of the County Assessor.
      (2)   If the subdivider objects to such evaluation, he or she may, at his
or her expense, obtain an appraisal of the property by a qualified real estate
appraiser approved by the City, such appraisal may be accepted by Council if
found reasonable.
      (3)   The City and the subdivider may agree as to the fair market value
based upon the purchase price of the property, if such purchase occurred within
18 months prior to the filing of the final plat.
   (d)   Procedure for Dedication of Fee in Lieu. The procedure for determining
whether the subdivides is to dedicate land, pay a fee, or both, shall be as
follows:
      (1)   At the time of filing a sketch plan for approval, the subdivider
shall, as a part of such sketch plan, indicate whether he or she desires to
dedicate property for park and recreational purposes or whether he or she
desires to pay a fee in lieu thereof. If he or she desires to dedicate the land
for such purpose, he or she shall designate the area thereof on the sketch
plan.
      (2)   At the time of the sketch plan approval, Council shall determine,
as a part of such approval, whether to require a dedication of land within the
subdivision notwithstanding the desire of the subdivides, a payment of a fee in
lieu thereof, or a combination of both.
      (3)   Where dedication is required, it shall be accomplished in
accordance with this section. Where fees are required the same shall be
deposited with the City prior to approval of the final plat. Open space
covenants for private park or recreational facilities shall be submitted to the
City prior to approval of the final plat and shall be recorded
contemporaneously with the final plat.
   (e)   Limitation on Use of Land and Fees. The land and fees received under
this section shall be used only for the purpose of providing park and
recreational facilities, open space or school sites, as appropriate. All
payments made in lieu of land shall be placed in a nonlapsing fund with the
City and shall be used by the City exclusively for the acquisition of such
sites. All dedications or payments made under this section shall be for the use
and benefit of the owners and future owners of the proposed subdivision only.
   (f)   Exceptions. Council may authorize exceptions from these Subdivision
Regulations in cases where, due to exceptional topographical conditions or
other conditions peculiar to the site, an unnecessary hardship is placed on the
subdivides. Such exceptions shall not be granted if it would be detrimental to
the public good, create a conflict with the Comprehensive Development Plan or
impair the intent and purpose of these Regulations. The conditions of any
exceptions authorized shall be stated in writing in the minutes of Council with
the justifications set forth.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85; Ord. 1800. Passed 9-25-18.)
1226.06  BLOCKS.
   A block shall be not less than 600 feet nor more than 1,320 feet in length,
unless, in the judgment of Council, a lesser or greater length is necessary to
secure efficient use of land or desired street patterns. A block shall be of
sufficient width to contain. two tiers of lots of minimum depth, unless the
lots will front on an arterial or collector street or unless topographical
conditions or the size of structures proposed to be erected render impractical
the creation of two tiers of lots, in which event Council may approve a single
tier of lots of minimum depth. If a block exceeds 600 feet in length and
Council so directs, one or more strips of land, which shall be not less than
ten feet in width and shall extend across the block at such location or
locations as Council designates, shall be dedicated to public use for
crosswalks, and one or more easements, which shall be not less than twenty feet
in width and shall extend across the block at such location or locations as
Council designates, shall be created for public utility lines.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1226.07  UTILITY EASEMENTS.
   An easement for poles, wires, conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, gas,
water and heat mains and other utility lines shall be established across the
rear part of a lot if an alley is not provided and such an easement, in the
judgment of Council, is necessary or desirable. If it is deemed necessary or
desirable by Council, such easement shall be established along side lot lines
or across other parts of a lot. Such easement shall be ten feet in width,
unless Council authorizes or requires an easement of a lesser or greater width.

1228.01  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   The requirements for improvements set forth in Sections
1228.04 through
1228.10 shall apply to every subdivision hereafter platted that is within or is
proposed to be annexed to the corporate limits of the City, and to every
existing street or alley of the City that abuts such subdivision. Section
1228.04 shall also apply to subdivisions hereafter platted that are within two
miles of, but are not proposed to be annexed to, the corporate limits of the
City. Such subdivisions shall be so laid out and platted that if they are
subsequently annexed to the City, the improvements referred to in Sections
1228.05 through
1228.10 may be constructed in the subdivision in accordance with the
requirements of such sections. Such improvements shall be constructed by the
person proposing the subdivision at his or her own expense, except as otherwise
provided in Section
1228.02. Construction shall not be commenced until after plans and
specifications, and contracts, if any, therefor, have been approved by the City
Manager, and shall be completed in accordance with such plans, specifications
and contracts. However, anything in the provisions of this section to the
contrary notwithstanding, the requirements of this section are subject to
Sections
1228.02,
1228.03 and
1228.11.
(Ord. 1118.Passed 3-22-88.)
1228.02  AGREEMENT TO CONSTRUCT IMPROVEMENTS.
   Prior to approval by Council of any final plat of a subdivision in which
some or all of the improvements required in Section
1228.01 have not been constructed, the owner of the property in such
subdivision shall enter into a written agreement with the City, which shall be
approved by Council as herein provided, and shall deposit with the Clerk-
Treasurer an amount equal to the fee of the County Clerk for recording the
agreement. Such agreement shall make provision for the following:
   (a)   The owner of the property shall agree to construct such improvements
within the time specified in the agreement and to compensate the City for the
cost to inspect the construction of such improvements. The subdivides shall
deposit with the City a performance and payment bond, an irrevocable letter of
credit, cash and/or other acceptable collateral, which is sufficient, in the
judgment of Council, to ensure financial capability for the completion of the
improvements required under Section
1228.01. Such assurance shall be supplied at the time the final plat is
accepted and shall be 1.25 times the cost to complete such improvements, as
estimated and/or approved by the City Manager.
   As improvements are completed and "as built drawings" are submitted, the
subdivides may apply to the City for a release of part or all of the collateral
deposited with the City. Upon inspection and approval of such improvements, the
City shall release such collateral. If the City determines that any of such
improvements is not constructed in substantial compliance with the
specifications, the City shall furnish the subdivides a list of specific
deficiencies and shall be entitled to withhold collateral sufficient to ensure
substantial compliance. If the City determines that the subdivides has not
constructed any or all of the improvements in a timely manner and in accordance
with all of the specifications, the City may withdraw and use from the deposit
of collateral such funds as may be necessary to construct the improvement or
improvements in accordance with the specifications.
   (b)   As an alternative or as a supplemental method to the property owner
constructing all of such improvements at his or her expense as provided in
subsection (a) hereof, if Council is satisfied that substantial development
shall commence within the subdivision within eighteen months after Council's
approval of the final plat of the subdivision, so that it is not likely that
the City will ultimately have to bear a substantial amount of the costs of the
improvements, then the agreement may provide that the property owners, which
are defined as all owners of private property in the proposed district or
districts, shall, concurrently with Council approval of the final plat of the
subdivision, file a petition in writing to the Mayor and Council to create a
proposed improvement district or districts. The boundaries of such proposed
district or districts must be approved by the City Manager, and such district
or districts must be authorized by statute to make one or more of the required
improvements in the subdivision without cost to the City, and to assess the
entire cost of any such improvement against the private property within the
improvement district.
   (c)   As an alternative or as a supplemental method to the property owner
constructing all of such improvements on an existing unimproved street or part
thereof adjoining a new subdivision, the owner shall waive, with respect to the
construction and special assessments referred to in subsection (b) hereof, the
provision of any statute to the effect that a protest filed with Council or the
City Clerk by the owner or owners of property in a proposed improvement
district will bar the formation of the district by Council.
   (d)   The owner shall agree that the agreement shall bind such owner, as
well as his, her or its personal representatives, heirs, devisees, legatees,
successors and assigns. Such agreement shall bear an acknowledgement by the
owner, be in a form recordable in the office of the County Clerk and otherwise
be in such form as the City Manager prescribes. Approval of the agreement by
Council, if granted, shall be specifically shown in the minutes of the meeting
of Council. Upon approval of the agreement and the final plat by Council, the
Clerk-Treasurer shall cause the agreement to be filed for record with the
County Clerk, such filing to be made either prior to or forthwith after the
filing of the plat with the County Clerk.
(Ord. 1223. Passed 8-11-92.)

initially by the City, whether or not specially assessed to benefited property,
shall be paid only in warrants as provided in Section 16-671 R.R.S. 1943,
unless Council otherwise directs.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1228.04  MARKING OF BLOCK, SUBDIVISION AND STREET BOUNDARIES.
   An iron rod not less than three-fourths of an inch in diameter and thirty-
six inches in length shall be set at all block corners, all points at which
street lines intersect the outer boundaries of the subdivision and all angle
points and points of curve in each street. All other lot corners shall be
marked with an iron rod not less than five-eighths of an inch in diameter and
eighteen inches in length. The tops of all iron rods shall be set flush with
the finished grade.

if any. Notice of the time and place of the hearing on the request for variance

construction, modification or alteration of a building or structure for which a
building permit is required, the right to such variance shall expire unless the
required building permit is issued within six months after the variance is
granted.
   (g)   Building Permits. If the Board grants an application for a variance in

not be issued until the statutory appeal period of fifteen days from the filing
of the decision of the Board has expired. No building permit may be issued;

hardship;

detriment to adjacent property and the character of the district will not be

convenience, profit or caprice.
      (5)   No variance shall be authorized unless the Board finds that the
condition or situation of the property concerned or the intended use of the
property is not of so general or recurring in nature as to make reasonably
practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an
amendment to the zoning regulations. (§ 19-910.2)
   (i)   Voting. The Board of Adjustments is a “quasi-judicial” body; thus, its
actions are not subject to review and approval of the governing body. In
exercising its powers, the Board may, in conformity with ordinances and state
statutes, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order,
requirement, decision, or determination appealed from, and may make such order,
requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made, and to that end
shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. The
concurring vote of four members of the five-member Board shall be necessary to
reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of any such
administrative official, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter
upon which it is required to pass under any such regulation or to effect any
variation in such regulation or grant or deny a variance. (§19-910(3))
(Ord. 1666.  Passed 1-10-12; Ord. 1800. Passed 9-25-18.)
1244.05  APPEALS.
   (a)   Process for Appeal.  Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Board
of Adjustment may appeal such Board decision.  An appellant may present a duly
verified petition to the district court setting forth that such decision is
illegal, in whole or in part, and specifying the grounds of such illegality.
The petition must be presented to the court within fifteen days after the
filing of the Board of Adjustments decision in the office of the Board.  Upon
the filing of such petition, a summons shall be issued and be served upon the
Board of Adjustment, together with a copy of the petition.  Return of service
shall be made within four days after the issuance of the summons.  Within ten
days after the return day of such summons, the Board of Adjustment shall file
an answer to said petition which shall admit or deny the substantial averments
of the petition, and shall state the contentions of the Board with reference to
the matters in dispute as disclosed by the petition. The answer shall be
verified in like manner as required for the petition. At the expiration of the
time for filing answer, the court shall proceed to hear and determine the cause
without delay and shall render judgment thereon according to the forms of law.
If, upon hearing, it shall appear to the court that testimony is necessary for
the proper disposition of the matter, it may take evidence or appoint a referee
to take such evidence as it may direct and report the same to the court with
its findings of fact and conclusions of law, which shall constitute a part of
the proceedings upon which the determination of the court shall be made. Said
appeal to the district court shall not stay proceedings upon the decision
appealed from, but the court may, on application, on notice to the Board and on
due cause shown, grant a restraining order. (§ 19-912)

1246.01  SPECIAL PERMIT DEFINED.
   A special permit is a permit for a use of a lot, tract of land, building or
structure which is permissible under this Zoning Code only if authorized by the
Planning Commission.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1246.02  ADOPTION OF STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES.
   The Planning Commission, before hearing or acting upon an application for a
special permit under this Zoning Code, shall, by resolution, adopt standards
and procedures to be applied and followed by the Commission for the purpose of
equitably and judiciously granting such special permits. Such standards and
procedures are subject to approval by Council as provided in subsection (3) of
Section 18-1306, Reissue Revised Statutes, 1943. Such resolution, when adopted,
shall govern all proceedings before and by the Commission concerning special
permits. The adoption by the Commission of a resolution in the following form
shall constitute adoption by the Commission of the standards and procedures
required by the statute, and the standards and procedures thus adopted by the
Commission shall be deemed to have been approved by Council:
   BE IT RESOLVED BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION OF THE CITY OF SIDNEY, NEBRASKA,
that the Planning Commission hereby adopts as the standards and procedures to
be applied and followed by it for the purpose of equitably and judiciously
granting special permits under
Chapter 1246 of the Codified Ordinances as now existing or hereafter amended,
all of the standards and procedures prescribed in such Chapter as now existing
or hereafter amended, concerning the issuance of special permits.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1246.03  CONDITIONS OF ISSUANCE.
   The Planning Commission may issue a special permit for the use of a lot,
tract of land, building or structure in circumstances and in a manner
authorized by this Zoning Code, if the Commission finds the proposed use:
   (a)   Provides a service required by the neighborhood or community and is
consistent with sound principles of land use;
   (b)   Will not be injurious to the use of neighboring lots, tracts of land,
buildings or structures;
   (c)   Will not create special hazards or problems for the area in which it
is located;
   (d)   Is related to and harmonious with the general plan for the area in
which it is located, as indicated by this Zoning Code; and
   (e)   Is otherwise in accordance with the intent and purposes of this Zoning
Code. The Commission may make the use which is authorized in the special permit
subject to reasonable conditions which, in the discretion of the Commission,
are necessary to carry out the intent and purposes of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1246.04  APPLICATIONS; FEE.
   An application for a special permit shall be signed, except in cases
provided in Section
1246.12(e), by the owner of a lot, tract of land, building or structure for

The application shall contain:
   (a)   A description of the lot or tract of land and the building or

($50.00).
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1246.05  HEARINGS; NOTICE.
   The Planning Commission shall promptly set an application for a special
permit for a public hearing. The Commission shall give notice of the time,
place and purpose of such hearing in the same manner as notice is required to
be given by Sections 19-904 and 19-905, Reissue Revised Statutes, 1943. Any
person entitled to notice may waive notice of such hearing in writing. Such
waiver shall accompany the application.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1246.06  FINDINGS BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   No special permit shall be issued unless the Planning Commission finds in
writing, that there exist, as a basis for the permit, facts under this Zoning
Code which authorize the issuance of the permit.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1246.07  ACTION BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   If the Planning Commission fails to act on an application after three
regular meetings of the Commission, the Commission shall be deemed to have
issued the special permit effective on the date of the third regular meeting
without conditions. However, if the applicant requests or consents to a
continuance of the hearing beyond such date, this section shall not apply.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1246.08  PENDING VARIANCES.
   No special permit may be issued while an application for a variance is
pending on hearing or determination by the Board of Adjustment or on appeal
from a decision of the Board.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1246.09  EXPIRATION OF PERMITS; BUILDING PERMITS REQUIRED.
   If the use for which a special permit is required also requires a building
permit, a special permit issued by the Planning Commission shall expire one
year after the day it is issued, unless the required building permit is issued
within one year after the special permit is issued.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1246.10  ISSUANCE OF SPECIAL PERMITS PRIOR TO BUILDING PERMITS AND CERTIFICATES
OF OCCUPANCY.
   Neither a building permit nor a certificate of occupancy for a use requiring
a special permit may be issued before a special permit is issued by the
Planning Commission. If the Commission issues a special permit for a use which
requires a building permit or a certificate of occupancy, or both, neither a
building permit nor a certificate of occupancy may be issued until a ten day
appeal period has expired.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1246.11  NONTRANSFERABILITY; TERMINATION.
   A special permit may not be transferred. If a change of ownership of the lot
or tract of land for which the special permit was issued occurs, the special
permit shall thereupon terminate.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1246.12  PERIMETER FENCES.
   (a)   Special Permits. A special permit to construct and maintain a
perimeter fence may only be issued to and held by a corporation:
      (1)   Organized and having perpetual existence under the laws of the
State;
      (2)   Having a registered agent in the County;
      (3)   Having under its Articles of Incorporation the power to construct
and maintain such a fence;
      (4)   Which owns the land or part of the land on which the fence is to be
constructed or, if it does not own any or owns only a part of such land, has a
clear legal right to construct and maintain the fence on the land which it does
not own;
      (5)   Which has entered into covenants, in writing, with the owner of any
land which the corporation does not own to construct and maintain the entire
fence in perpetuity, which covenants shall run with the land, bind the
corporation's successors and be in recordable form;
      (6)   Which has recorded similar covenants with respect to land which the
corporation still owns; and
      (7)   Which has otherwise complied with the requirements for a special
permit prescribed in this chapter.
   (b)   Applications. An application for a special permit to construct and
maintain a perimeter fence may be signed only by a corporation which meets or
will meet all of the requirements specified in subsection (a) hereof. The
application shall allege, in addition to the matters specified in Section
1246.04, that the corporation has complied or, before the issuance of a permit
will comply, in full with each of the requirements specified in subsection (a)
hereof, stating the facts with respect to each requirement in such subsection.
The application shall be accompanied by:
      (1)   A copy, certified by the Secretary of the corporation, of the
Articles of Incorporation and any amendment thereto showing the dates of filing
of each with the Secretary of State; and
      (2)   If the fence or a part thereof is to be constructed upon lands not
owned by the corporation, a list of the names and addresses of the owners of
such lands, together with a sample copy of the written covenants which the
corporation has entered or will enter into with such owners on behalf of
itself, its successors and its assigns concerning the construction and
maintenance of the fence; and, with respect to the lands of which the
corporation still is the record title owner, a sample copy of the written
covenants which the corporation has executed and recorded, or will execute and
record, whereby the corporation has bound or will bind itself, its successors
and its assigns to construct and maintain the fence. The application shall also
be accompanied by a filing fee in the amount specified in Section
1246.04.
   (c)   Bond or Cash Deposits. If the Planning Commission finds that a special
permit to construct and maintain a perimeter fence should be issued, it may
make the special permit, when issued, subject to reasonable conditions, and
shaft, before a special permit is issued, fix the amount of a bond or cash
deposit to be filed by the corporation with the Clerk-Treasurer, who shall
approve such amount prior to the issuance of the special permit. The bond shall
be executed by the corporation and by a corporate surety authorized to do
business in the State. The bond or cash deposit shall be payable to the City to
reimburse the City fox any damage the City may sustain if the corporation, its
successors or its assigns fails to construct and maintain the perimeter fence,
or any part thereof, fn compliance with
Chapter 1268 and this chapter (including, but not limited to, reasonable
expenses the City may incur in obtaining or attempting to obtain compliance by
the corporation, its successors or its assigns with such chapters, whether
through or without litigation). The condition of the bond shall be that the
corporation, its successors and its assigns shall construct and maintain the
perimeter fence in compliance with such chapters. Otherwise, the bond or cash
deposit shall remain in full force and effect.
   (d)   Term. The permit shaft, in the sound discretion of the Commission, be
for a permanent use or for a use of a term of years, and regardless shall be
subject to the conditions specified in subsections (e) and (f) hereof.
   (e)   Revocation. If the corporation fails to construct or maintain the
perimeter fence in compliance with
Chapter 1268 and this chapter, the City Manager shall so notify the corporation
(or as the case may be, its successors or its assigns) and the surety company
in a writing mailed to each by certified mail addressed to the last known
address of each. If the default is not corrected within ninety days thereafter,
the Commission may, after notice to the corporation, surety company and owners
of record of the land on or adjacent to which the fence or affected segment of
the fence was constructed, order the fence repaired, replaced or removed in
whole or in part. Either before, after or in the absence of an order to repair,
replace or remove the fence, the Commission may revoke the special permit in
whole or in part. The remedies provided in this subsection shall not be
exclusive of, but cumulative to, any other remedies at law or equity which the
City or owners of affected land may have by reason of the presence, nature,
condition or absence of the fence, or any part thereof, and resort to one
remedy shall not bar a resort to another, unless the remedies are inherently
mutually exclusive.
   (f)   Removal of Obstructions. Anything in this Zoning Code to the contrary
notwithstanding, any permit that is issued by the Commission to construct and
maintain a perimeter fence within the right of way of a public street, alley or
other public way which is outside the corporate limits of the City shall be and
remain without prejudice to any rights with respect to such street, alley or
other public way which are vested in the public by operation of law. If such
street, alley or public way is subsequently annexed to the City, the same shall
be and remain subject to the power of Council to order the removal of
obstructions from such street, alley or public way within the corporate limits
of the City. Any permit which the Commission proposes to issue concerning the
construction and maintenance of a perimeter fence within the right of way of a
public street, alley or other public way which then is within the corporate
limits of the City, shall be and remain subject to the power of Council to
order the removal of obstructions from such street, alley or public way within
the corporate limits of the City, and no such permit shall be issued by the
Commission prior to authorization of the proposed obstruction by Council. Such
authorization by Council, if granted, shall reserve to Council the right to
subsequently order the obstruction removed and may be upon such other terms and
conditions as Council may prescribe.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1246.13  SUBDIVISION IDENTIFICATION SIGNS.
   If the Planning Commission finds that a special permit to erect and maintain
a subdivision identification sign in a residence zone should be issued, the
Commission may make the permit, when issued, subject to reasonable conditions,
and shall, before such permit is issued, fix the amount of a bond to be filed
by the owner of the sign with the Clerk-Treasurer, who shall approve such
amount prior to the issuance of the permit. The bond shall be executed by the
owner and by a corporate surety authorized to do business in the State. The
bond shall be payable to the City to reimburse the City for any damage the City
may sustain if the owner, its successors or its assigns fails to construct and
maintain the sign, or any part thereof, in compliance with
Chapter 1272 (including, but not limited to, reasonable expenses the City may
incur in obtaining or attempting to obtain compliance by the owner, its
successors or its assigns with
Chapter 1272, whether through or without litigation). The condition of the bond
shall be that the owner, its successors and its assigns shall erect and
maintain the sign in compliance with the requirements of

(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85; Ord. 1800. Passed 9-25-18.)
1248.02  ACTION BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (a)   Referral. A proposal made in compliance with Section
1248.01 shall be referred by the Clerk-Treasurer to the Planning Commission.
   (b)   Hearing. The Commission shall hear and consider the proposal at its
next regular meeting or at a special meeting, whichever occurs first, but not
later than thirty days after the proposal has been referred to it. The
Commission shall cause notice to be served upon the board of education of each

   (c)   Recommendations. The Commission shall make a written recommendation to
Council within seventy days after the proposal has been referred to the

      (1)   Rejection of the proposal entirely;
      (2)   Approval of the proposal without amendment; or
      (3)   Approval of the proposal with amendments the Commission finds
appropriate.
   The failure of the Commission to act on the proposal within the time
specified in this section shall constitute a recommendation of approval of the
proposal without amendments. However, if the applicant requests or consents to
a continuance, the preceding sentence shall not apply.
(Ord. 1049 Passed 2-26-85.)
1248.03  ACTION BY COUNCIL.
   (a)   Hearing; Notice. After Council receives a written recommendation of
the Planning Commission or after the time within which the Commission may act
expires without action by the Commission, Council shall set the matter for a
public hearing at either a regular meeting or at a special meeting called for
that purpose, and shall cause notice of such hearing to be given as required by
statute. Such hearing shall be held within thirty days after the recommendation
of the Commission has been received or is due, whichever occurs first, unless
the applicant requests or consents to a continuance or, if there is no
applicant, Council orders a continuance. A person entitled to notice may waive
such notice in writing.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
   (b)   Decisions.  After the hearing provided for by subsection (a) hereof
Council may:
      (1)   Deny the proposal;
      (2)   Grant the proposal; or
      (3)   Grant the proposal with modifications which were proposed at the
public hearing held by the Commission and at the public hearing held by
Council. Council may make modifications which were not proposed at such
hearings if such modifications do not materially change the sense of the basic
proposal which was the subject of the hearings. The granting of a proposal,
with or without modifications, shall not effect an amendment of the City's
Zoning Code. Such amendment shall become effective only upon the enactment and
publication of an amending ordinance as provided by law.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1248.04  WITHDRAWAL, OF PETITIONS.
   A petition filed as provided in Section
1248.01 may be withdrawn with the permission of either the Planning Commission
or Council before such body acts on it. However, if public notice of a hearing
on the petition is given as provided by statute, such hearing shall be held.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1248.05  DENIAL OF PETITIONS; REFILING.
   If a petition submitted in accordance with Section
1248.01 is denied by Council, the proposal may not be presented again by
petition within one year after the date of the filing of the petition that was
denied, unless either the Planning Commission or Council gives special
permission for such petition to be refiled sooner.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1248.06  ISSUANCE OF PERMITS AND CERTIFICATES DURING PENDENCY OF PROCEEDINGS.
   No department of the City may issue a building permit, certificate of
occupancy or other pertinent permit when a hearing on a proposal, as provided
for in Section
1248.01, is pending before either the Planning Commission or Council, or when
the action of Council is the subject of a pending judicial action, except as is
required to repair and maintain any building, structure, lot or tract of land
while the proposal is pending.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1248.07  PLANNED BUSINESS CENTERS.
   (a)   Generally. A proposal to establish a Planned Business Center (PBC)
Zone and to construct therein a Planned Business Center is subject to this
chapter. No person shall construct, maintain, occupy or operate a Planned
Business Center not established in accordance with this chapter.
   (b)   Tentative Development Plans.
      (1)   Petitions.  A petition for the establishment of a PBC Zone shall be
filed with the Clerk-Treasurer, shall be accompanied by a tentative development
plan which shall be filed with the petition, shall request both the
establishment of a PBC Zone in a described area and the approval of the
tentative plan and shall be signed by the owner of the lot or tract of land
located in the proposed PBC Zone.
      (2)    Contents.  The tentative development plan shall include: A. A site
plan showing the area to be developed for buildings, the anticipated total
gross floor space, the area to be developed for parking, points of ingress and
egress (including access streets where required) and adjustments to be made for
abutting lots, tracts of land and zones; B. An architect's preliminary sketches
of buildings and landscaping; C. A statement of the types of businesses and
uses proposed and of the market area to be served; and D, A statement of the
ownership in the proposed PBC Zone.
   (c)   Effective Date of Zone; Condition.  If a proposal to establish a PBC
Zone is approved by Council, with or without amendments, the establishment of
the PBC Zone is effective when the ordinance approving the proposal becomes
effective, subject to a subsequent condition that a final development plan
shall be submitted to and approved by Council as provided in this section. Upon
failure to submit a final plan, or if Council makes final findings disapproving
a final plan, the PBC Zone shall automatically terminate and, if immediately
prior to the establishment of the zone, the land had been otherwise zoned by an
ordinance of the City, the land shall automatically become subject again to the
former zoning.
   (d)   Final Development Plans.
      (1)   Submissions.  Within twenty-four months after the enactment of an
ordinance establishing a PBC Zone, the owner of the lot or tract of land
located in the PBC Zone shall submit a final development plan to Council for
approval.
      (2)   Modification of tentative plans. The final development plan shall
conform to the tentative development plan approved by Council. However, the
petitioner may, before Council acts on the final plan, file with the Clerk-
Treasurer a request for modification of the tentative plan as approved. If it
appears to Council that the use of the land in accordance with the tentative
plan as proposed to be modified may be of a substantially different character,
for zoning purposes, from the use of the land in accordance with the tentative
plan as approved, Council, before acting upon the request for a modification,
shall order the request referred to the Planning Commission. Thereafter
proceedings shall be had upon the request before the Commission and
subsequently before Council as provided in Sections
1248.02(b) and
1248.03(a). If a request for a modification is approved, with or without
changes, by Council, the modifications as approved shall be incorporated in the
final plan by the petitioner.
      (3)   Contents.  In addition to any modifications of the tentative
development plan approved as provided in paragraph(d)(2) hereof, the final
development plan shall include:
         A.   A site plan showing areas to be developed for buildings, areas to
be developed for parking, locations of pedestrian paths and vehicular roads,
locations of ingress and egress (including access streets where required),
locations and heights of walls, provisions for loading and unloading, the
location, size and number of signs and locations and types of improvements to
be made in relation to the use of abutting lots or tracts of land and other
zones;
         B.   An architect's sketches of the proposed buildings and
landscaping;
         C.   Preliminary engineering plans of the improvements to be
installed;
         D.   A schedule for planned construction showing the anticipated
completion date;
         E.   A statement of the types of businesses and uses proposed to be
served; and
         F.   A statement of the ownership of the proposed planned business
center.
      (4)   Approval.  If Council finds that the final development plan
conforms to the tentative development plan as approved by Council and any
modifications approved in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) hereof, Council may
approve the final plan by resolution. The approval shall be endorsed on the
final plan by the Mayor, or, in the event of his or her absence or disability,
by the Vice-President of Council.
      (5)   Disapproval and reconsideration. If Council finds that the final
development plan does not conform to the tentative development plan, with or
without modifications approved in accordance with paragraph (d) (2) hereof, and
there is no petition pending to further modify the final plan so that it will
so conform, Council shall, by resolution, make findings that the final plan
fails to conform and disapprove it. The City Clerk shall promptly notify the
petitioner that the final plan has been disapproved and shall state the
findings of Council. If the petitioner does not file a petition to modify the
proposed final plan within twenty days after Council has disapproved the plan,
Council's disapproval thereon shall become final. If the petitioner does file a
petition to modify the final plan and it appears from the petition that the
proposed modifications are such that the final plan so modified will conform to
the tentative plan and modifications of it previously approved, Council shall
reconsider its action of disapproval at its next regular meeting or at a
special meeting called for that purpose to meet before its next regular
meeting. If, after reconsideration, Council finds the modifications proposed to
the disapproved final plan are sufficient to cause it to conform to the
tentative plan and any modifications of the tentative plan previously approved,
Council may, by resolution, approve the final plan as modified.
      (6)   Subsequent modifications. After a final development plan has been
approved, as provided in paragraph (d)(4) or (5) hereof, the owner of the land
may file with the Clerk-Treasurer a petition to modify the final plan. If it
appears to Council that the use of the land in accordance with the final plan
as proposed to be modified may be of a substantially different character, for
zoning purposes, from the use of the land in accordance with the final plan as
approved, Council, before acting upon the request for modification, shall order
the request referred to the Planning Commission. Thereafter, proceedings shall
be had upon the request before the Commission and subsequently before Council,
as provided in Sections
1248.02(b) and
1248.03(a).

1260.01  FINDINGS.
   Council finds that planned unit developments differ in various significant
respects from other types of land ownership, development and use, and that such
developments therefore require certain different regulations.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1260.02  INTENT AND PURPOSES.
   The general intent and purposes of this chapter are to establish standards
and procedures, including standards and procedures that are more flexible than
those which are prescribed by conventional zoning regulations, whereby
sufficiently large and properly located land areas can be developed in
accordance with innovations and imaginative land planning concepts in a manner
that will best serve both private and public interests. More particularly, but
without limitation of the above generalities, the intent and purposes of this
chapter are to:
   (a)   Permit greater flexibility in the design of integrated developments;
   (b)   Encourage the design of varieties of housing and other land uses in
such developments;
   (c)   Encourage reservation of greater proportions of open spaces for visual
purposes and recreational uses;
   (d)   Ensure, in the. process, that population density and building density
and bulk conform to the general objectives of the City's Zoning Code,
Subdivision Regulations. and Comprehensive Development Plan; and
   (e)   Facilitate accomplishment of these objectives through planned unit
developments of various types.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)

requirements and other provisions of this Zoning Code which otherwise would
apply .to the development, if the Commission determines that the requirements
of this chapter are met. However, the Commission may not issue a special permit
for townhouses or cluster housing in OP, C-1, C-2, C-3, M-1, M-1(s) and M-
2 Zones.

1264.02  SPECIAL REQUIREMENT.
   Any use with respect to which there appears in the chart in Section
1264.01(b) an identifying letter opposite the description of the use is subject
to the following special requirements (as well as requirements, if any, in
other chapters of this Zoning Code):
   A.   If a building has been built on a lot which comprises more than twenty-
five percent of the front footage of any block, no such building or structure
shall be built or structurally altered which projects beyond the average front
yard setback already established, but if the only building is one on an
adjoining lot, the minimum front yard setback shall be the setback of such
building. However, the front yard setback shall be not less than twenty-five
feet.
   B.   If a lot abuts on a public alley, the minimum rear yard setback is five
feet; otherwise the minimum rear yard setback is fifteen feet.
   C.   The minimum side yard setback is five feet for buildings and structures
not more than three stories high. For buildings more than three stories high,
the required minimum side yard setback is increased one foot for each
additional story over three.
   D.   In an R-3 or O-P Zone, the minimum lot area per dwelling unit and the
maximum lot coverage are as follows:
    Minimum Lot Area   Percent of Lot
   (sq. ft.)   Coverage
   500   70
   450   65
   400   60
   350   55
   300   45
   E.   A mobile home shall set back a minimum of twenty feet from the property
line of a mobile home park. The front setback of mobile home shall be a minimum
of fifteen feet from the curb on interior drives and the side setback shall be
a minimum of eighteen feet between mobile homes. No mobile home shall be
situated closer than eighteen feet to any service or other mobile home park
permanent building.
   F.   The density of a mobile home park shall be not more than 7,560 square
feet of mobile home floor space per gross acre.
   G.   No minimum rear year setback is required, except for a lot in a C or M
Zone abutting the side of a lot in either an R or O-P Zone, in which case the

      (1)   Such uses shall be located in a primary dwelling which shall
clearly be the dwelling used by a person as their private residence.
      (2)   Any additional traffic and/or parking shall not adversely affect
the residential character of the neighborhood, impede surrounding traffic
flows, or create hazardous or unsafe conditions within the neighborhood.
   (b)   Minor home occupations. Uses classified as minor home occupations
shall be permitted in all zoning districts which allow single-family
residences. No permit shall be required. The following regulations shall apply
to all minor home occupations:
      (1)   Such use shall be conducted entirely within a dwelling or an
accessory building and carried on by the inhabitants thereof and no others.
      (2)   No more than one person other than a member of the family household
is employed.
      (3)   Such use shall be clearly incidental and secondary to the use of
the dwelling for dwelling purposes and the appearance of the structure shall
not be altered or the occupation within the residence be conducted in a manner
which would cause the premises to differ from its residential character either
by the use of colors, materials, construction, lighting, signs, or the
emissions of sounds, odors, or vibrations which carry beyond the premises.
      (4)   No more than 25 percent of the total floor area of the dwelling may
be used for home occupation.

employs no more than two nonresident employees. Major home occupations shall be
encouraged in neighborhoods in transition from one land use to another and

permit by the planning commission for a yearly fee in the amount established by
the city. Permits must be renewed annually on May 1 of each year.
   (d)   The following regulations shall apply to major home occupations:

accessory building and carried on by the inhabitants thereof. No more than two
people who are not residents of the dwelling can participate in the business.
      (2)   Such use shall be clearly incidental and secondary to the use of
the dwelling for dwelling purposes and the appearance of the structure shall
not be altered or the occupation within the residence be conducted in a manner
which would cause the premises to differ from its residential character either

1276.01  ESTABLISHMENT OF SPECIAL LINES.
   To facilitate future widening or realigning of existing major streets and
the establishment of major streets in the future, special street right-of-way
lines, shown on the Official Zoning Map of the City, are established by this
chapter. Such lines are established in the exercise and to the extent of the
City's zoning power only, and nothing in this Zoning Code shall be construed to
constitute the establishment or dedication of a public street or the taking of
private property for such purpose.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1276.02  PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION.
   (a)   The Planning Commission may initiate proceedings or hear and determine
application to establish additional special street right-of-way lines for the
purpose of facilitating future widening or realigning of existing major streets
or the establishment of major streets in the future.
   (b)   A proposal to establish additional special street right-of-way lines
shall be set for hearing before the Planning Commission and notice of such
hearing shall be published once in the official newspaper for the City not less
than seven days before the hearing.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1276.03  COUNCIL ACTION ON PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS.
   When the Planning Commission has made a recommendation to Council concerning
the establishment of additional right-of-way lines, Council shall set the
proposal for hearing and a notice of the hearing shall be given as required in
the case of other proposals to amend the City's zoning ordinances.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85,)
1276.04  BUILDING PERMITS; INSTALLATION OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS AND UTILITY
FACILITIES.
   After the Planning Commission has caused notice of a hearing to be published
as provided in Section
1276.02(b) and prior to any final action on the proposal by Council, no
building permit shall be issued for the construction of a building or structure
which, if constructed in accordance with the plans on which the building permit
is sought, would violate any proposed or recommended special street right-of-
way line if adopted by Council in such proceedings. Nor shall any public
improvement or utility facility be installed during this period unless Council
specifically authorizes or approves the same. However, nothing in this section
shall be construed to impair the obligation of contracts of privately owned
public utilities or to constitute the taking of property of such utilities.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1276.05  MEASUREMENT OF SETBACKS.
   If a special street right-of-way line has been or is established for any lot

   The provisions of this chapter govern all nonconforming uses.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1278.02  ESTABLISHMENT OF NONCONFORMING USES; BURDEN OF PROOF.
   (a)   The use of a building, structure or land, existing and lawful at the
time of the adoption of a zoning regulation or at the time of an amendment of a
regulation, may, except as provided in this section, be continued, although
such use does not conform with such regulation or amendment. Such use may be
extended throughout the same building if no structural alteration of such
building is proposed or made for the purpose of such extension. If such
nonconforming use is in fact discontinued for a period of twelve months, such
right to the nonconforming use shall be forfeited and any future use of the
building and premises shall conform to such regulation.
   (b)   The burden of showing the facts necessary to establish the existence
of a nonconforming use and of a right to continue such use shall be upon the
person asserting that the lot, tract of land, building or structure enjoys such
status.

construction of which had been commenced at the time this Code was enacted, may
be completed in accordance with the plans with respect to which the building
permit was issued if the construction is completed within one year after the
building permit was issued, In such event, such planned use of the building or
structure is a nonconforming use.
   (b)   Repairs. A building or structure whose use is nonconforming shall be
kept in repair and in sound condition.
   (c)   Enlargement or Moving. A building or structure whose use is nonforming
shall not be enlarged or increased to occupy more area than such building
occupied on its lot or tract of land when this Zoning Code was enacted,
(Ordinance 1049, passed February 26, 1985), nor may its nonconforming use be
enlarged or increased within such building or structure. However, if the only
nonconforming use is a legal nonconforming use in relation to setback
requirements, the existence of such nonconforming use shall not prohibit:
      (1)   The construction of an addition to a building or structure, or the
construction of an accessory building, which does not otherwise fail to conform
to the requirements of this Zoning Code; or
      (2)   The enlargement or increase of a use within a building or structure
which does not otherwise fail to conform to the requirements of this Code.
   A building or structure whose use is nonconforming shall not be moved in
whole or in part to any other part of a lot or tract of land it occupies so
long as any part of its use is nonconforming.
   (d)   Damaged. A building or structure whose use is nonconforming and which
is damaged or partially destroyed by fire, flood, wind, earthquake or any other
calamity, so that its fair market value after the damage or partial destruction
is more than fifty percent of its appraised value established for tax purposes
immediately before the damage or partial destruction, may be restored to its
former condition and its nonconforming use continued if restoration is begun
within one year after the damage or partial destruction and diligently
continued to completion. If the fair market value of such building or structure
after such damage or partial destruction is less than fifty percent of its
appraised value established for tax purposes immediately before the damage or
partial destruction, such building or structure may be repaired, restored or
reconstructed only if after repair, restoration or reconstruction the building
or structure complies with all requirements of this Zoning Code. However, any
repair, restoration or reconstruction of a building or structure must comply
fully with the City's ordinances regulating such work.
   (e)   Conversion to a Conforming Use. The nonconforming use of land on
which, at the time of enactment of this Zoning Code there is no building having
an assessed valuation for tax purposes in excess of seven hundred fifty dollars
($750.00), shall be converted to a use conforming with this Code within a
period of five years if located within an R Zone, or within three years if
located within an O-P, C or M Zone.
   (f)   Different Nonconforming Use. The use of any building or structure
which is nonconforming shall not be changed to a different nonconforming use,
except one that is of the same or a more restrictive classification.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1278.04  VACANT PROPERTY.
   A lot, tract of land, building or structure, or any combination thereof,
whose use is nonconforming and which becomes and remains vacant and unoccupied
for a continuous period of one year may only be re-occupied for a use that
conforms to all the requirements of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1278.05  RESIDENCE BUILDINGS.
   Anything in this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, the restrictions
set forth in Section
1278.03(c), (d) and (f) do not apply to a residence use if there is no increase
in the number of dwelling units in such residence building.
(Ord. 1049. Passed 2-26-85.)
1278.06  MOBILE HOMES.
   Mobile homes shall comply with the provisions of this chapter pertaining to

consider, among other things, the purposes of this chapter, the historical and

similar features of other buildings within a historical district, and the
position of such building or structure in relation to the street or public way

been achieved, the certificate of approval shall be deemed finally denied and
the applicant so notified by letter and the applicant may appeal to the Council
within twenty days of the date of the letter finally denying the application.
The Council may, after a public hearing, reverse or modify the recommendation
of the Board but only if it finds that owing to special conditions pertaining

cause undue and unnecessary hardship.

   Whenever used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
stated in this section unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.
   (a)   “Landscape.”  To change the natural features of a plot of ground so as
to make it more attractive by adding lawns, trees, bushes, or other decorative
items.
   (b)   “Landscaped area.” The area within the boundaries of a given lot,
site, or common development consisting primarily of plant material, including
but not limited to grass, trees, shrubs, vines, ground cover, and other organic
plant materials.
   (c)   “Planting yard.” A landscaped screen intended to partially block
visual contact between uses and create separation.
   (d)   “Street planting yard.” A planting area parallel to a public street
designed to provide continuity of vegetation along the right-of-way and a

(Ord. 1768.  Passed 9-8-15.)
1410.02  PURPOSE.
   The provisions of this chapter provide additional guidance on the
development of sites within Sidney by addressing landscaping and screening
requirements. The provisions in this chapter are designed to improve the
appearance of the community, buffer potential incompatible land uses from one
another, and conserve the value of properties within the City of Sidney and its
extra-territorial jurisdiction. This consideration for green infrastructure in
Sidney and its entrance corridors helps to soften harsh environmental impacts
implicit with community growth. The provisions in this chapter are further
intended to expedite development approval by including predictable, uniform
standards for landscaping.
(Ord. 1768.  Passed 9-8-15.)
1410.03  APPLICABILITY.

than the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   (7)   "Channel" means a natural or artificial watercourse of perceptible
extent, with a definite bed and banks to confine and conduct continuously or
periodically flowing water. "Channel flow" thus means that water which is
flowing within the limits of a defined channel.
   (8)   "Community" means a state, area or political subdivision thereof which
has the authority to adopt and enforce flood plain management regulations for
the areas within its jurisdiction.
   (9)   "Development" means man-made change to improved or unimproved real

structures for which the start of construction commenced before the effective
date of the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or before January 1, 1975, for a
FIRM that is effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be
referred to as "existing structures."
   (11)   "Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from A. The overflow
of inland or tidal waters; or B . The unusual and rapid accumulation or run-off

as the Flood Boundary Floodway Map and the water surface elevation of the base
flood.
   (14)   "Flood plain management" means the operation of an overall program of
corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including, but
not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and flood
plain management regulations.
   (15)   "Flood protection system" means those physical structural works
constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of
the area within a community subject to a special flood hazard. Such a system
typically includes levees or dikes. Such specialized modifying works are those
constructed in conformity with sound engineering standards.
   (16)   "Flood proofing" means any combination of structural and
nonstructural additions, changes or adjustments to structures, including
utility and sanitary facilities, which would preclude the entry of water.
Structural components shall have the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy.
   (17)   "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent portion of the flood plain that must be reserved in order to discharge

more than one foot at any point, assuming equal conveyance reduction outside
the channel from the two sides of the flood plain.
   (18)   "Floodway fringe" means that area of the flood plain, outside of the
floodway, that on the average is likely to be flooded once every 100 years (i.
e. that has a one percent chance of flood occurrence in any one year).
   (19)   "Freeboard" means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above
a flood level for purposes of flood plain management. "Freeboard" tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave actions, clogged bridge openings and the hydrological
effect of urbanization of the watershed.
   (20)   "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the
ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   (21)   "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including the basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other

that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of
the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this chapter.
   (22)   "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to required utilities. For flood

the underlying zoning district.
   (27)   "Start of construction" includes (for other than new construction or
substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (P.L. 9?348 )
) substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued,
provided that the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. "Actual
start" means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; the
installation of streets and/or walkways; excavation for a basement, footings or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; or the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

above ground, a manufactured home and a gas or liquid storage tank that is
principally above ground.
   (29)   "Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction or
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or repair is
started or, if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred.
   "Substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration
of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure. "Substantial improvement" does not, however, include either a
project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing State or local
health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to
ensure safe living conditions, or an alteration of a structure listed on the
National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.
   (30)   "Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirement of this
chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be
prohibited by this chapter where specific enforcement would result in
unnecessary hardship.
(Ord. 1114. Passed 2-23-88.)
1430.03  APPLICATION OF CHAPTER.
   This chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City
identified on the City's Flood Insurance Rate Map as numbered and unnumbered A
Zones and within Floodway Overlay and Floodway Fringe Overlay Districts, as
established in Section
1430.12. In all areas covered by this chapter, no development shall be
permitted except upon a permit to develop granted by Council or its duly
designated representative, under such safeguards and restrictions as Council or
the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and
maintenance of the general welfare and health of the inhabitants of the City,
and where specifically noted in this chapter.
(Ord. 1114. Passed 2-23-88.)
1430.04  CITY INSPECTOR AS ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.
   The City Inspector is hereby appointed to administer and implement this
chapter, his or her duties to include, but not be limited to:
   (a)   Reviewing all development permits to ensure that sites are reasonably
safe from flooding and that the permit requirements of this chapter have been
satisfied;
   (b)   Reviewing permits for proposed development to ensure that all
necessary permits have been obtained from those Federal, State or local
governmental agencies from which prior approval is required;
   (c)   Notifying adjacent communities and the Natural Resources Commission
Flood Plain Management Section prior to any alteration or relocation of a
watercourse, and submitting evidence of such notification to the Federal
Insurance Administration when participating in the National Flood Insurance
Program;
   (d)   Ensuring that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated
portion of a watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished;
   (e)   Verifying and recording the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor (including the basement) of all new or substantially
improved structures;
   (f)   Verifying and recording the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) to which a new or substantially improved structure has been
floodproofed; and
   (g)   Obtaining certification from a registered professional engineer or
architect when floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure.
(Ord. 1114. Passed 2-23-88.)
1430.05  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (a)   Flood Losses Resulting From Periodic Inundation. The flood hazard
areas of the City are subject to inundation which results in loss of life,
property and health, safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
   (b)   General Causes of Flood Losses. Such flood losses are caused by the
cumulative effect of obstruction in floodways causing increases in flood
heights and velocities and the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses
vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others, which areas are inadequately
elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage.
   (c)   Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards. This chapter uses a reasonable
method of analyzing flood hazards, which method consists of a series of the
following interrelated steps:
      (1)   Selection of a base flood which is based upon engineering
calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as expected
frequency of occurrence, the area inundated and the depth of inundation. The
base flood selected for this chapter is representative of a large flood which
is reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular
streams subject to this chapter. Such base flood is in the general order of a
flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any
one year, as delineated in the official Flood Plain Study and illustrative
materials dated September 16, 1980, as amended, which Study is hereby
incorporated by reference in this section.
      (2)   Calculation of water surface profiles based upon a hydraulic
engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas
to convey the base flood;
      (3)   Computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without
increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point;
      (4)   Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no
obstruction is permitted which would cause any increase in flood height; and
      (5)   Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e. that area which is outside the
floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood.
(Ord. 1114. Passed 2-23-88.)
1430.06  INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   The boundaries of the Floodway and Floodway Fringe Overlay Districts shall
be determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map. Where
interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the
districts as shown on the official zoning map (if, for example there appears to
be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions), the
enforcement officer shall make the necessary interpretation. In such cases
where the interpretation is contested, the Board of Adjustment shall resolve
the dispute. The base flood elevation for the point in question shall be the
governing factor in locating the district boundary on the land. The person
contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to present his or her case to the Board and to submit his or her
own technical evidence, if he or she so desires.
(Ord. 1114. Passed 2-23-88.)
1430.07  INTERPRETATION; CONFLICTS.
   (a)   It is not the intent of this chapter to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing easement, covenant or deed restriction. However, where this chapter
imposes greater restrictions, this chapter shall prevail. All ordinances
inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the
inconsistency only.
   (b)   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed
in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal
of any other power granted by State statute.
(Ord. 1114. Passed 2-23-88.)
1430.08  COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   No development located within the known flood hazard areas of the City shall
be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance
with this chapter and other applicable regulations.
(Ord. 1114. Passed 2-23-88.)
1430.09  DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height
may be increased by man-made or natural causes such as ice jams and bridge
openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside
Floodway and Floodway Fringe Overlay District boundaries, or land uses
permitted within such Districts, will be free from flooding or flood damage.
This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City or any officer
or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 1114. Passed 2-23-88.)
1430.10  APPLICATION TO BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT FOR PERMITS AND VARIANCES.
   If a request for a permit to develop or a variance is denied by the City
Inspector, the applicant may apply for such permit or variance directly to the
Board of Adjustment. The Board may grant or deny such request by appropriate
resolution adopted within sixty days after the date of such application to the
Board.
(Ord. 1114. Passed 2-23-88.)
1430.11  PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person shall initiate any development or substantial improvement, or
cause the same to be done, without first obtaining a separate permit for
development.
(Ord. 1114. Passed 2-23-88.)
1430.12  DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.

amended.
      (4)   In passing upon such applications, the Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this chapter and:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept into other lands to the
injury of others;
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         E.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         F.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to
flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and flood plain management program for that area;
         I.   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         J.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and
bridges
   (b)   Conditions.
      (1)   Generally, a variance may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half-acre or less which
is contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, provided that paragraphs (b) (2) to (6) hereof have
been fully considered. As lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical jurisdiction required for issuing a variance increases.
      (2)   A variance may be issued for reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places
or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to paragraphs (b)(3)
to (6) hereof.
      (3)   A variance shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (4)   A variance shall be issued only upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (5)   A variance shall be issued only upon a showing of good and
sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and a determination that the
granting of such variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense, or create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
      (6)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given a
written notice that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the
increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

through finished ceilings and walls and when extending through floors shall be
not less than two inches above them. The outlet fitting or the pipe shall be
securely fastened. Outlets shall not be placed behind doors. Outlets shall be
far enough from floors and walls to permit the use of a pipe wrench of suitable
size without straining or bending the pipe.
(Ord. 368. Passed 8-4-50.)
1484.30  LOCATION ANTS MARKING OF SHUT-OFF VALVES.
   Main gas shut-off valves controlling several piping systems shall be placed
an adequate distance from each other so they will be easily accessible for
operation and shall be installed so as to be protected from injury. It is
recommended that they be plainly marked with a metal tag by the installer so
that the piping system supplied through them can be readily identified. It is
advisable to place a shut-off valve at every point where safety, convenience of
operation and maintenance demand it.
   In multiple-tenant buildings supplied through master meters or where meters
are not readily accessible from the appliance location, an individual shut-off
valve for each apartment or for each separate house line shall be provided at a
convenient point of general accessibility.
(Ord. 368. Passed 8-4-50.
1484.31  TESTING.
   Before any system of gas piping is finally put in service, it shall be
carefully tested to assure that it is gaslight. Where any part of the system is
to be enclosed or concealed, this test should precede the work of closing in.
To test for tightness the piping may be filled with City gas, air or inert gas
but not with any other gas or liquid. In no case shall oxygen ever be used. The
piping must stand a pressure of ten pounds per square inch for a period of not
less than ten minutes without showing any drop in pressure.
(Ord. 368.Passed 8-4-50.)
1484.32  OPENINGS TO BE CLOSED BEFORE TURNING GAS ON.
   Before turning gas under pressure into any piping, all openings from which
gas can escape shall be closed.
(Ord. 368. Passed 8-4-50.)
1484.33  SMOKING PROHIBITED WHILE WORKING ON PIPING.
   When working on piping that contains or has contained gas, smoking is not
permitted.
(Ord. 368. Passed 8-4-50.)
1484.34  PRECAUTIONS WHEN WORK ON PIPING INTERRUPTED.
   When interruptions in work on gas piping occur, the system shall be left in
a safe and satisfactory condition.
(Ord. 368. Passed 8-4-50.)
1484.35  METER CHECK FOR LEAKAGE.
   Immediately after turning gas into the piping, the system shall be checked
to ascertain that no gas is escaping. This can be done by carefully watching
the test dial of the meter to determine whether or not gas is passing through
the meter. To assist in observing any movement of the test hand, wet a small
piece of paper and paste its edge directly over the centerline of the hand as
soon as the gas is turned on. Allow five minutes for a one-half foot dial and
proportionately longer for a larger dial in checking for gas flow. This
observation should be made with the test hand on the "upstroke." If careful
observation of the test hand for a sufficient length of time reveals no
movement, the pipe shall be purged and the small gas burner turned on and
lighted and the hand of the test dial again observed. If the dial hand now
moves, it will show that the meter is operating properly. If the test hand does
not move or register the flow of gas through the meter to the small burner, it
is certain that the meter is defective and the gas should be turned off and the
gas company notified. If the test hand shows movement, ail appliances or
outlets supplied through the meter shall be examined to see if they are turned
off and do not leak. If they are found tight, movement of the test hand will
indicate that there is a leak in the piping system. The meter valve shall be
turned off until the necessary repairs have been made, after which the test
specified in this section shall be repeated.
(Ord. 368. Passed 8-4-50.)
1484.36  STANDARD REQUIREMENTS.
   Each gas appliance and accessory designed for domestic or commercial use
should be of a type complying with applicable American Standard Approval or
Listing Requirements, or equivalent, covering safe operation, substantial and
durable construction and acceptable performance. Such compliance may be
determined by the presence on the appliance or accessory of a label of a
nationally recognized testing agency qualified and equipped to perform the test
necessary to determine such compliance and maintaining an adequate periodic
inspection of current production models, and whose label on the appliance or
accessory states that it complies with national safety requirements. Such
compliance may also be determined by the listing of the appliance or accessory
in a list published by such nationally recognized testing agency, which states
that the appliance or accessory complies with national safety requirements. The
inclusion of provisions for the installation of unlisted appliances and
accessories shall not be construed as acceptance of such equipment from the
standpoint of general design, construction or performance.
   In cases where no applicable American Standard Approval or Listing
Requirements have been developed for a given class of appliance or accessory,
approval of the City Inspector should be obtained before the appliance or
accessory is installed.
(Ord. 368. Passed 8-4-50.)
1484.37  TYPE OF GAS TO BE USED.
   Before array gas appliance is installed, it shall be determined that the
appliance has been designed for use with the gas to which it will be connected.
No attempt shall be made to convert the appliance from the gas specified on the
rating plate for use with a different gas without consulting the local gas
company or the manufacturer for complete instructions.
(Ord. 368. Passed 8-4-50.)
1484.38  RAISING TEMPERATURE OF COMBUSTIBLE WALLS, ETC.
   All gas appliances and their flue or vent connectors shall be installed so
that continued or intermittent operation will not create a hazard to persons or
property. They shall not, during operation, raise the temperature of
unprotected combustible walls, partitions, floors or ceilings more than ninety
degrees Fahrenheit above normal room temperature when measured with mercury
thermometers or conventional bead-type thermocouples. When wall and partition
temperatures are measured with disc-type thermocouples as specified in American
Standard Approval Requirements, or equivalent, for the types of appliances
involved, an indicated temperature rise of 120 degrees Fahrenheit will
correspond to the ninety degrees Fahrenheit rise measured with thermometers or
conventional bead-type thermocouples.
(Ord. 368. Passed 8-4-50.)
1484.39  INSTALLATION NEAR FLAMMABLE VAPORS.
   Gas appliances shall not be installed in any location where flammable vapors

successful operation shall be equipped with a vent pipe leading to the outer
air or into the combustion chamber adjacent to a constantly burning pilot,
unless they are constructed or equipped to limit the escape of gas from the
vent opening in the event of diaphragm failure to not more than 1.0 cubic feet
per hour of a 0.6 specific gravity gas at seven inches of water column
pressure. In case of vents leading to the outer air, means shall be employed to
prevent water from entering the pipe and also to prevent stoppage of it by
insects and foreign matter. Vents entering the combustion chamber shall be
located so that the escaping gas will be readily ignited from the pilot flame
and so that the heat liberated will not adversely affect the operation of the
thermal element. The terminus of the vent shall be securely held in a faxed
position relative to the pilot flame.
