1.	The Council requires thatthe MCS provider's construction, operation, and maintenance of the multi-channel system meet certain threshold safety levels which are designed to protect the public and lessen the likelihood of interruption of multi-channel service.

2.	Consequently, the Council may require may non-exempt MCS provider to adopt the following safety requirements:



a)	Emergency alert override activation in the manner set forth in this ordinance;

Sec.  10-1951	PROVISIONS  TO  ALERT   SUBSCRIBERS  IN  THE  EVENT  OF  AN
 
EMERGENCY; STANDBY POWER.

1.	In order that subscribers may be alerted in the event of an impending, imminent or actual, natural, or man-made emergency, then all MCS providers shall ensure that the multi-channel system providing multi-channel service to all or part of the City is designed so as to permit an authorized official of the City to override the audio portion of all channels by tough tone phone (or functional equivalent) from any location.

2.	In addition to any other requirements listed in this Section, an MCS provider shall:

a)	Designate a channel which will be used for emergency broadcasts of both audio and video;

b)	Reasonably inform subscribers of the designated emergency channel;

c)	Maintain all channel video blanking capability to facilitate the needs of hearing and sight-impaired customers;

d)	Test the emergency override system not less than once a month;

e)	Cooperate with the City on the use and operation of the emergency alert override system; and

f)	Develop a plan (with the City's concurrence) in order to provide continuity ofmultiยญ channel service and response to service calls in the event of a natural or man made emergency

3.	As one method of providing continuity of multi-channel services in the event of a natural or man made emergency, an MCS provider shall, unless exempted by the Council, have the capacity for four (4) hour automatically activated standby power on all trunk and feeder cable, and all headbands, hubs, and receive sites associated with the distribution of cable service to and throughout the City.

Sec. 10-1952  SAFETY ALERT TECHNOLOGY.

1.	The Council considers the need for an indoor signal or safety alert technology available to both subscribers and non-subscribers of an MCS provider's lowest level of programming service of paramount interest and need and as such should be an integral part of an MCS provider's system. Though in some ways similar to the concept of emergency alert override, signal alert technology is different and distinct in that it may be used by both subscribers to basic service and non-subscribers to the basic service of an MCS provider's system. Moreover, such safety alert technology is connected to the National Weather Service twenty-four (24) hour radio service including its new WRSAME/"Site Select" weather and warning system which specifically allows for an indoor warning and notification via an audio alert voice path regardless of whether an individual has a television receiver or monitor, or an FM receiver and, moreover, can provide effectively instantaneous alert and warning, as well as needed instructions in
 
addition to allowing key connnunity oriented entities to connnunicate with both the general populace and selected segments of the connnunity.

2.	In realization and recognition of the preceding, a non-exempt MCS provider shall offer for use throughout the City (within twelve (12) months of the effective date of this ordinance) a signal or safety alert monitoring technology for purposes of altering both subscribers and non-subscribers of a multi-channel system to impending or occurring disaster emergencies and allowing the City to connnunicate with subscribers and the public as the need to do so may exist at any time.
3.	Anon-exempt MCS provider shall cooperate with the City and the provider of said technology in the marketing and distribution of the necessary on premises alert receiving devices, including the installation and replacement of such as maybe needed from time to time.

4.	A non-exempt MCS provider shall install the necessary electronics, processing, and distribution equipment in the MCS provider's headend, and will ensure the maintenance, operating condition, and replacement of such equipment as is necessary to protect its continued use.

5.	Notwithstanding the preceding, a non-exempt MCS provider has no responsibility for repair of such equipment beyond obtaining (in a timely manner) replacement from the manufacturer for inoperable components.

6.	It is explicitly understood that one need not be a subscriber to a multi-channel system to use the safety alert device and receive the safety alert service so long as a drop is installed into the address to which said device is attached. It is also understood that the user need not have a television receiver.

7.	The Council recognizes the positive effect on the safety of the public in general, and the ability to save lives and property of those who would otherwise be prevented from receiving the most expeditious warning or alert possible without such a device and technology. Consequently, the Council requires that all non-exempt MCS providers shall participate in a periodic public awareness campaign as deemed appropriate by the Council in cooperation with the Council and the manufacturer to
inform the citizenry and non-cable subscribers of the availability and capability of such safety alert technology.

8.	An MCS provider shall assure that all subscribers to multi-channel service receive printed material fully describing the technology and its benefits, at least annually, and at the time of installation/

9.	An MCS provider shall allow non-subscribers of Basic Cable Service the choice of purchasing or leasing the necessary equipment which shall include the cost of installation on a non-discriminatory basis and so inform such persons of both options.

10.	Given the significant public safety and life and property saving benefits of this technology and the resultant need of as much of the general public as possible to be
 
protected from the otherwise unnecessary greater risk to life, limb, and property associated with other alert/warning systems, an MCS provider shall assure that the service is placed on the same level of service and is priced commensurate with that for like technology/service in the Mid-Western United States.

11.	Given the importance and critical nature of preventing the loss oflife and property, and the need and ability of the Council to communicate directly with the public in any number of situations, including but not limited to those potentially involving matters of life and death, and as this technology is clearly not a programming service, the Council deems it appropriate to designate the use of the capability of such technology as s governmental use of the system, and it is the intent of the City that it be made available to all subscribers.

Sec.10-1953  IMPLEMENTATION OF A PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM.

1.	It shall be the duty of an MCS provider to devise and implement a quarterly preventative maintenance program for the multi-channel system in order to ensure that there is no material degradation of the multi-channel system that would effect the citizens' health, safety, and welfare, or negatively affect the quality of multi-channel services being provided.

2.	Before the MCS provider implements such a program, it shall be reviewed and approved by the Council. Within forty-five (45) days after the completion of the quarterly preventative maintenance program, the MCS provider shall prepare and submit a written report to the Council detaining the results of the tests conducted and all items performed or addressed during the quarterly program. Although not exhaustive, the following areas should be  included in a preventative maintenance program and subsequent report:

a)	Inspection and repair, if needed, of the headend;

b)	Inspection and repair, if needed, of the antenna tower;

c)	Requiring weather proofing and protection of the antenna lead connectors, and on any other exposed fittings;

d)	Requiring the conducting of signal leakage tests that are in accord with FCC requirements;

e)	Removing tree roots, limbs, and branches that interfere with or come in contact with the MCS provider's cable;

f)	Requiring the periodic servicing, testing, and calibration of the MCS provider's equipment including equipment on service vehicles and field test equipment;

g)	Employing a status monitoring system to identify problems or situations in which the multi-channel electronics are operating outside pre-programmed parameters;
 

h)	Testing of the emergency alert system to ensure that it will function property during an emergency situation;

i)	Testing of the safety alert system or technology.

Sec. 10-1954  CONSTRUCTION, FIRE, AND SAFETY CODES.

1.	An MCS provider shall construct, operate, maintain, repair, remove, replace, or restore the multi-channel system in strict compliance with all current technical codes adopted by the Council, the State, or the United States.

2.	The codes referred to specifically include but are not limited to construction, fire and safety, and zoning codes.

Sec. 10-1955  ALTERNATIVE USER CHARGE.

1.	This Section is applicable to any un-franchised but otherwise authorized MCS provider and to any MCS provider who has had its franchise ruled unconstitutional, unenforceable, or invalid. For all franchised MCS providers the provisions concerning franchise fees shall be applicable.

2.	Where not specifically prohibited by Federal or State law and as an alternative to the imposition of a franchise fee as set forth in this ordinance, the Council may impose, extract, and collect a charge from an affected MCS provider for the use by such provider of the streets, rights-of-way, easements, and public ways of the City.

3.	The alternative user charge shall be based on the following mathematical mode:

a)	Determine the present value of all public streets, rights-of-way, easements, and public ways of the City in which are located multi-channel system facilities and equipment of the affected MCS provider;

b)	Take the average percentage increase in land appraisals within the City (as determined by the Washington County Assessor for the City, for the five preceding years);

c)	Take the average percentage increase for the five preceding years and use it to determine the dollar amount of property value increase for the remaining term ofthe franchise (if no franchise applicable then use five years);

d)	Add the present value to the dollar amount of property value increase for the remaining term of the franchise (if no franchise applicable then use 5 years);

e)	Divide the adjusted value by the remaining number of years on the term of the franchise (if no franchise applicable then use 5 years);
 
f)	Multiply that figure by five percent (5%) to arrive at the annual user charge that is to be collected from the affected MCS provider. For purposes of illustration only, the formula reads as follows:

present value the dollar amount of the property value increase for remaining term of the franchise (based on average percentage increase ofland appraisals for past years of franchise term; divide the adjusted present value by the remaining years on the term of the franchise; multiply that figure by five percent (5%),  (equals) the annual alternative user charge.

4.	The Council adopts such an alternative user charge in order to receive fair compensation for the affected MCS provider's use of the public streets and public ways if such compensation cannot be obtained by imposing a flat percentage fee on such MC provider's annual gross revenues. However, an affected MCS provider may agree to an alternative charge that is based on a flat percentage of gross revenue, as long as that charge did not exceed the maximum amount previously allowed under law that was assessed as a franchise fee calculated as a percentage of an affected MCS provider's annual gross revenues.

5.	It is expressly understood that a franchise fee and an alternative user charge will not be imposed on the same MCS provider at the same time for the same period.

6.	An affected MCS provider shall at no time be charged or obligated to pay an alternative user charge that exceeds the maximum amount previously allowed under law that was assessed as a franchise fee calculated as a percentage of such MCS provider's gross revenues (as defined by this ordinance) for any particular reporting period. In the event that the alternative user charge does exceed the maximum amount previously allowed under law that was assessed as a franchise fee and calculated as a percentage of gross revenues, then such alternative user charge should be reduced to reflect an amount not greater than the maximum amount previously allowed under law that was assessed as a franchise fee and calculated as a percentage of gross revenues.

7.	An affected MCS provider shall pay twenty-five percent (25%) of the alternative user charge at the end of every three (3) months.

Ifthe Council determines the average hours of use per day for any required PEG channel is less than one ( 1)hour then the requirement for that channel's availability shall cease and an affected cable operator may use such channel for any lawful purpose unless and until the Council determined that need for the use of the channel again exists.

5.	If at any time ninety percent (90%) of the total time allocated for any required PEG channel is consistently used five (5) days a week for a period of three (3) months, then the cable operator shall provide an additional PEG channel.

City of Omaha, 188 Neb. 628 198 N.W.2nd. 483 (1972), and studies in other communities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; St. Paul, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; Beaumont, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Newport News, Virginia; Bellevue, Washington; New York, New York; Tucson, Arizona; New Hanover, Florida; Ellicottville, New York; Islip, New York; Des Moines, Washington; El Paso, Texas; Cleburne, Texas; Las Vegas, Nevada; Manattee County, Florida; Adams County, Colorado; and St. Croix County, Wisconsin; and findings from the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), which were discussed during City Council meetings and made available to the City Council, the City Council finds:

(1)	Sexually oriented businesses have negative secondary effects on the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them, causing increased crime, the downgrading of property values, the downgrading of adjacent neighborhoods, and the downgrading of the quality oflife in the adjacent areas.

(2)	The negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses are increased when they are located in close proximity to each other and when the service or consumption of alcohol is involved.
 
(3)	Improper conduct involving sexual acts occurs at sexually oriented  businesses which provide private or semi-private booths or viewing rooms for the viewing of films, videos or live performances.

(4)	The findings noted above raise substantial governmental concerns for the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of Blair and it is appropriate for the purpose of promoting and protecting the health , safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of Blair that reasonable regulations be enacted so as to address the substantial governmental concerns and minimize and control the negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses and thereby promote and protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of Blair, protect the citizens from increased crime, preserve the quality of life, preserve the value of property, and preserve the quality of life and the quality and character of surrounding neighborhoods.

(5)	The enactment of reasonable regulations which involve locational criteria, licensing criteria, operational criteria, and the prohibition of alcohol are appropriate to address the substantial governmental concerns and promote and protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of Blair.

(6)	A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of reasonable regulations on the owners of sexually oriented businesses and such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the owners to see that the sexually oriented business is operated in a manner which is consistent with the health, safety and welfare of patrons, employees and citizens of the City of Blair, Nebraska.

(7)	The prohibition of doors on viewing booths and rooms and the requirement of sufficient lighting and line-of-sight requirements and structural requirements advance the substantial government interest in preventing improper conduct and sexual acts from occurring in such viewing booths and rooms.

(8)	The fact that an applicant for sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sex-related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this Ordinance and the barring of such individuals from receiving a sexually oriented business license for a period of years serves as deterrent to and prevents conduct in contravention of this Ordinance.

(9)	The health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of Blair will be promoted and protected by the enactment of this Ordinance.

Article 2. Sex Offender Residency Sec. 15-201 FINDINGS AND INTENT.
A.	The Nebraska Legislature has found that certain sex offenders present a high risk to conunit repeat offenses and has enabled cities to restrict such persons place of residency as provided in the Sexual Predator Residency Restriction Act.

B.	Repeat sex offenders who use physical violence and prey on children are sexual perpetrators who present an extreme threat to public safety. Where there is a high risk to repeat such acts, such persons are extremely likely to pose a great threat to children. These offenders conunit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sex offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, extremely exorbitant.

C. It is the intent of this Ordinance to serve the City's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City by creating certain areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers where certain sexual predators cannot reside. (Amended by Ordinance 2064 06/13/2006)

A.	Sex offender shall be anyone defined in the Sex Offender Registration Act (Sections 29- 4001to29-4013, inclusive, Neb. Rev. Stat.) or any amendments thereto, as of the effective date of this Ordinance, or any person convicted under the law of another state, if at the time of the conviction under the law of such other state, the offense for which the person was convicted would have required registration under the Nebraska Sex Offender Registration Act, if the conviction occurred in Nebraska.

B.	Residence means a place where the person regularly sleeps, where the person has established his home, where he is habitually present, and to which when he departs he intends to return. A residence may include more than one location and may be mobile or transitory. Residency may be shown by, among other evidence, receipt of mail at the premises or identification of the premises as a residence on a driver's license, vehicle registration, or other document.

C. Child Care Facility means a place with a license issued under the Nebraska Child Care Licensing Act, sections 71-1908 to 71-1923, as currently existing or hereafter amended. Itshall include licensed places both inside and outside of the corporate limits of the city.

B. Measurement of Distance. For purposes of determining the mm1mum distance separation, the requirement shall be measured by following a straight line from the outer property line of the permanent residence or temporary residence to the nearest outer boundary line of a public or nonpublic elementary or secondary school, preschool or licensed child care facility.

C.	Penalties.   A person who violates this section shall be punished as provided generally in
this code.

D.	Exceptions. A person residing within 500 feet of any real property comprising of a public or nonpublic elementary or secondary school, preschool or licensed child care facility does not commit a violation of this section if any of the following apply:

(2)	The person is a minor or ward under a guardianship and resides with the guardian.

(3)	The person established such residence prior to the effective date of this ordinance.

(4)	The person's place of residence becomes a violation of this ordinance solely because of annexation into the City.

(5)	The public or nonpublic elementary or secondary school, preschool or child care facility within 500 feet of the person's permanent residence was established after the person's initial date ofresidence at that location.
(Amended by Ordinance 2064 06/13/2006) (Amended by Ordinance 2187 06/08/2010)

Sec. 15-204 SEVERABILITY.

1002. 14   FINDINGS OF FACT


1)	FLOOD LOSSES RESULTING FROM PERIODIC  INUNDATION :   The flood
hazard areas of Blair, Nebraska , are subject to inundation which results in loss oflife and property , health , and safety hazards , disrnption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health , safety, and general welfare .
2)	GENERAL CAUSES OF THESE FLOOD LOSSES : These flood losses are caused
 
by : (1) The cumulative effect of obstmction in floodways causing increases in flood heights and velocities , (2) The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others, which are inadequately or otherwise protected from flood damages .

3)	METHODS  USED  TO  ANALYZE  FLOOD  HAZARDS :	This  Section uses  a
reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series ofinterrelated steps.

A)	Selection of a base flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated , and the depth of inundation . The base flood selected for this ordinance is representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this ordinance . It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent (1%) chance of occurrence in any one year, as delineated on the Flood Insurance Study, and illustrative materials, dated January 6, 2012 , as amended .

B)	Calculation of water surface profiles based upon a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the base flood .

C)	Computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than 1 foot at any point.

D)	Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstmction is permitted which would cause any water surface increase along the floodway profile .

E)	Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area  outside  the  floodway encroachment lines, but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood .

1002. 15 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE : It is the purpose of this Section to promote the public health , safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in Section 1002. 14 by applying the provisions of this Section to :

1)	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health , safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities .

2)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities which serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial constmction .

3)	Protect  individuals  from  buying  lands  which  are  unsuited   for  intended  purposes  because of flood hazard .
 

4)	Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance in the National Flood Insurance Program.

1002. 16 JURISDICTION : This Section shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Blair identified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) dated January 6, 2012 , as amended, as A Zones (including AE, AH, AO, AR or A99 Zones) and/or within the Zoning Districts FW and FF established in Section 1002.21 of this Section. In all areas covered by this Section no development shall be permitted except upon the issuance of a floodplain development permit , granted by the City Council or its duly designated representative , under such safeguards and restriction as they may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community and where specifically noted in Sections 1002.22 through 1002.26.

1002. 17 ENFORCEMENT OFFICER : The City Administrator and/or his designee is hereby designated as the City Council 's duly designated Enforcement Officer under this Section.

1002. 18       INTERPRETATION   OF  DISTRICT  BOUNDARIES   AND  MISCELLANEOUS
PROVISIONS : The boundaries of the floodway and flood fringe overlay districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or Floodway Map . Where interpretation is needed to the exact location of the boundaries of the districts as shown on the official zoning map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, the Enforcement Officer shall make the necessary interpretation . In such cases where the interpretation is contested , the Board of Adjustment will resolve the dispute . The base flood elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating the district boundary on the land . The person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the Board of Adjustment and to submit his own technical evidence, if he so desires.

1)	Compliance .  Within identified special flood hazard areas of this community , no development shall be located , extended , converted or structurally altered without foll compliance with the terms of this Section and other applicable regulations .

2)	Abrogation and Greater Restrictions . It is not intended by this Section to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions . However , where this Section imposes greater restrictions , the provision of this Section shall prevail. All other Sections inconsistent with this Section are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.

3)	Interpretation . In their interpretation and application , the provisions of this Section shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.

4)	Warning and Disclaimer of Liability . The degree of flood protection required by this Section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering
 
and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This Section does not imply that areas outside floodway and flood fringe district boundaries or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages . This Section shall not create liability on the part of the City of Blair or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this Section or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

5)	Severability . If any section, clause, provision or portion of this Section is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction , the remainder of this Section shall not be affected thereby .

6)	Application for Appeal. Where a request for a permit to develop or a variance is denied by the City Administrator and/or his designee, the applicant may apply for such permit or variance directly to the Board of Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment may grant to deny such request by appropriate resolution adopted within thirty (30) days after such application to the Board of Adjustment.

SECTION 404.08		PROCEDURE  FOR  APPROVAL  OF ADMINISTRATIVE  TWO  LOT REPLATS

The Zoning Administrator may approve Administrative Two Lot Replats of two contiguous platted lots within the same subdivision without further approval by the Planning Commission or City Council if all of the following conditions are met:

A.	The proposed two lot replat does not involve a change in subdivision class and type, a change in zoning district, or a significant change in surface drainage.

B.	The proposed two lot replat is a transaction between owners of two contiguous platted lots within the same subdivision, which involves only a change in the boundary between the two platted lots owned by such persons, does not create an additional lot, and does not result in the creation of a substandard-size platted lot.

Following the mailing of the written notices required in Section 404.06, if a protest or protests against such two lot replat be filed in the office of the City Clerk within ten (10) days of the notice of such two lot replat, which are duly signed by the owners of twenty percent (20%) of the total area, excepting public streets and ways, located within three hundred feet of the boundaries of the properties proposed to be replatted, approval of such two lot replat shall not be made by the Zoning Administrator under this section, and the approval of such replat shall be made by the procedure as set forth hereinabove by hearing before the Planning Commission and City Council.

ARTICLES.	SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS

SECTION 501  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used safely for building purposes without danger to health or peril from fire, flood, erosion or other menace. If, following adequate investigation, conducted by all public agencies concerned, it is determined that land to be subdivided cannot be used without endangering the health, safety, welfare or prosperity of the community, or would necessitate an excessive expenditure of public financial resources for sewage and water facilities, other public facilities and streets, then the subdivision plat shall not be approved unless the subdivider formulates adequate methods for meeting such problems.

All subdivision design shall conform to standards of the Comprehensive Development Plan and to the City Zoning Regulations.

All required improvements shall be constructed or installed to conform to the provisions of this Ordinance and City specifications.

SECTION 502 STREETS


The an-angement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall confmm to the Comprehensive Plan and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets.

502.02










502.03
 
STREET EXTENSIONS: The street layout of the proposed subdivision shall provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of streets and alleys already existing in areas being subdivided. Where, at the determination of the Planning Commission it is desirable to provide street access to adjoining properties, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundaries of such properties. Where the Planning Commission deems it  necessary, such dead-end streets shall be provided with a temporary turnaround having a radius of at least fifty (50) feet. The street system for the proposed subdivision shall provide for extending existing streets at the same or greater width, but in no case shall a street extension be of less width than the minimum width required in these Regulations for a street in its categmy.

DEDICATIONOFRIGHT-OF-WAYFORNEWSTREETS: Thededicationofrightยญ of-way for new streets measured from lot line to lot line shall be as shown in the Comprehensive Plan, or, if not shown thereon, shall meet the right-of-way requirements as provided in Schedule A of these regulations. All streets classified as arterial streets by the Comprehensive Plan shall have all points of access approved by the Planning Commission. Marginal access streets may be required by the Planning Commission for subdivisions fronting on arterial streets.

DEDICATION  OF RIGHT-OF-WAY  FOR EXISTING  STREETS:    Subdivisions
 

platted along existing streets shall dedicate additional right-of-way if necessary to meet the minimum street width requirements set forth in these Regulations. The entire minimum right-of-way width shall be dedicated where the subdivision is on both sides of an existing street. When the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing street, one-half (1/2) of the required right-of-way width, measured from center line of the existing roadway, shall be dedicated. Dedication of one-half (1/2) of the right-ofยญ way for proposed streets along the boundaries ofland proposed for subdivision shall be prohibited.

502.06
 
INTERSECTIONS:   Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at an angle of ninety
(90) degrees, and no intersection shall be at an angle of less than eighty (80) degrees. Street curb intersections shall be rounded by radii of at least twenty (20) feet. When the smallest angle of street intersection is less than seventy-five (75) degrees, the Planning Commission may require curb radii of greater length. Wherever necessary to permit the construction of a curb having a desirable radius without reducing the sidewalk at a street corner to less than normal width, the property line at such street corner shall be rounded or otherwise set back sufficiently to permit such curb construction. No lot or other parcel of land which abuts on and has access to either a collector or a minor street shall have a service drive, curb cut, or other means of access to an arterial street within seventy-five (75) feet of the right-of-way of any street which intersects such arterial street on the side on which such lot or parcel is located.

When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point by more than ten
(10) degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than four hundred (400) feet for collector streets, and of such greater or less radii as the Planning Commission shall determine for special cases.

HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL STREET CURVES: A tangentatleastonehundred
(100) feet long shall be introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets. Where there is a deflection angle of more than ten (10) degrees in the alignment of a street, a curve with a radius adequate to insure safe sight distance shall be made. The minimum radii of curves provided in Schedule A of these regulations shall be required.

Every change in grade shall be connected by a vertical curve constructed so as to afford a minimum sight distance of two hundred (200) feet, said sight distance being measured from a driver's eyes, which are assumed to be four and one-half (4-1/2) feet above the pavement surface, to an object four (4) inches high on the pavement. Profiles of all streets showing natural or finished grades, drawn to an approved scale, may be required by the Planning Commission.

STREET GRADES AND ELEVATIONS: All streets shall be designed so as to provide for the discharge of surface water from the pavement and from the right-of-way by grading and drainage. For adequate drainage, the minimum street grade shall be not less than one-half (1/2) of one (1) percent.   The Planning Commission shall not approve
 

streets which will be subject to inundation or flooding. All streets must be located at elevations which will make them flood-free in order that portions of the subdivisions will not be isolated by floods. Where flood conditions exist, the Planning Commission shall require profiles or elevations of streets in order to determine the advisability of permitting the proposed subdivision activity. Fill may be used in areas subject to flooding in order to provide flood-free streets if such fill does not increase flood heights. Drainage openings shall be designed so as not to restrict the flow of water and thereby increase flood heights.

Street grades shall conform to the minimum requirements provided in Schedule A of these Regulations.

 
502.07

502.09







502.10
 
MARGINAL ACCESS STREETS: Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the Planning Commission may require access streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a non-access reservation along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of adjacent properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic.

Where the proposed subdivision abuts upon or contains an existing or proposed arterial street or highway on which traffic volumes and vehicular speeds warrant special safety considerations, the Planning Commission may require that marginal access streets be provided in order that no lots front on such existing or proposed arterial street or highway.

Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access highway right-of-way, the Planning Commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations.

STREET JOGS: Street jogs with center line offsets ofless than one hundred fifty (150) feet shall be prohibited.

CUL-DE-SACS: Minor terminal or dead ends streets or courts which are designed so as to have one end permanently closed shall not be longer than six hundred (600) feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a tum-around having a radius at the outside of the pavement of at least 50 feet and a radius at the outside of the right-of-way of at least
62.5 feet.

STREET NAMES: Proposed streets which are in alignment with other already existing and named streets shall bear the names of such existing streets. The name of a proposed street which is not in alignment with an existing street, shall not duplicate the name of
 

any existing street, irrespective of the use of the suffix street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place, court, lane, road, pike, highway, parkway, or similar suffix.

Whenever a street  alignment changes direction more than forty-five (45) degrees without a return to the original alignment within a distance of five hundred (500) feet, then the name of the street shall be changed at the point of curvature.

To avoid duplication and confusion, the proposed names of all streets shall be approved by City Planning Commission prior to such names being assigned or used.

 
502.11
 
PRIVATE STREETS AND RESERVE STRIPS: There shall be no private streets platted within a subdivision. There shall be no reserve strips in a subdivision except where their control is definitely vested in the municipality or county under conditions approved by the City Council as authorized in these Regulations.
 

SECTION   503	ALLEYS

Alleys shall be provided to give access to the rear of all lots used for commercial and industrial purposes except when lots are located within Highway Commercial or Industrial zoned properties when the size or configuration of said facilities would not necessitate alley access. The minimum width of an alley shall be twenty (20) feet. Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided, but where necessary, comers shall be cut off sufficiently to pe1mit safe vehicular movement. Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable, shall be provided with adequate facilities at the dead-end as determined by the Planning Commission. Alleys shall not be provided in residential areas except in cases where the subdivider produces evidence of the need for alleys which is satisfactory to the Planning Commission.

SECTION	504	BLOCKS

The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to the provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated; zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions; needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic; and limitations and opportunities of topography.

 
504.01




504.02







504.03
 
BLOCK LENGTHS: Block lengths shall not exceed one thousand (1,000) feet or be less than three hundred sixty (360) feet, except as the Planning Commission considers necessary to secure efficient use of land or desired features of street layout.

BLOCK WIDTHS AND TIERS: Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two (2) tiers of lots of minimum depth, provided, that where this would require lots to front on an arterial street or highway or where topographical conditions or the size of the property prevent two (2) tiers oflots, the Planning Commission may approve a single tier oflots of minimum depth.

PEDESTRIAN  WAYS:   Pedestrian ways not less than ten feet (10') wide may be
 

required in blocks  longer than five hundred feet (500') where such crosswalks are deemed by the Planning Commission to be essential to provide circulation, or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation or other community facilities.

SECTION  505	LOTS


The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation, and the minimum building setback lines shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated.

 
505.01







505.02


505.03

505.05
 
LOT DIMENSIONS: Lot dimensions shall conform to the requirements of the Zoning Regulations. Residential lots where not served by public sewer shall not be of less width or area than that required by the Zoning Regulations, and in no case shall such lots be of less width than sixty (60) feet and of less area than seven thousand five hundred (7,500) square feet.

CORNER LOTS: Comer lots for residential use shall have extra width to permit appropriate building setback from and orientation to both streets.
ACCESS TO LOTS: The subdividing of the land shall be such as to provide, by means of a public street, each lot with a minimum of 30' access to an existing public street.

DOUBLE FRONTAGE AND REVERSE FRONTAGE LOTS:  Double frontage and
reverse frontage lots, shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. A planting screen easement of at least ten (10) feet, and across which there shall be no right of access, shall be provided along the line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other disadvantageous use.

ANGLE OF SIDE LOT LINES: Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to street lines.
 

SECTION  506	FLOOD HAZARDS


Land subject to flooding and land deemed to be topographically unsuitable for residential development shall not be platted for residential use or for any other use which may increase the danger to health, life, or property or aggravate erosion or flood hazards.   Such land within the subdivision shall be set aside on the plat for such uses as will not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation contrary to the public welfare.  To insure that lots will be located only where they will provide flood-free building sites, the Planning Commission may require the subdivider to provide  elevation  and  flood profiles  sufficient  to  demonstrate  that the building  sites will  be completely free from the danger of flooding.  If a stream flows through or adjacent to the proposed subdivision, the plat plan shall provide for easement of right-of-way along the stream for a :floodway. For the smaller streams, the plan shall also provide for channel improvement to enable then to cany all reasonable floods within banlcs. The floor elevations of structures intended for human habitation shall be high enough to be above the level of one hundred (100) year frequency flood. The :floodway
 

easement shall be wide enough to provide for future enlargement of the stream channel as adjacent areas become more highly developed and run-off rates are increased.

SECTION  507	OFF-STREET LOADING AND PARKING FACILITIES

All lots or parcels platted shall provide sufficient space for off-street loading and parking facilities to meet the requirements of the zoning district within said lot of parcel is platted.

SECTION  508	EASEMENTS


Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided for utilities where necessary and shall be at least sixteen (16) feet wide.

Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainageway, channel, or street, there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such water course, and such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose.  Parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection therewith.

SECTION  509	COMMUNITY ASSETS

In all subdivisions, due regard shall be shown for natural features such as large trees, unusual rock formations, and water courses; for sites which have historical significance; and for similar assets which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the subdivision and to the area. The Planning Commission may prepare a list of all such features within its Area of Planning Jurisdiction which it deems worthy of preservation.

SECTION  510	CONFORMANCE WITH OTHER REGULATIONS

No final plat ofland within the area of force and effect of existing Zoning Regulations will be approved unless it conforms with such regulations. Whenever there is a variance between the minimum standards set forth in these Regulations and those contained in the building code, or other official regulations, the highest standard shall apply.

SECTION  511	RESERVATION  AND DEDICATION  OF PUBLIC LAND AND OPEN SPACE

511.1	RESERVATION: Before final plat approval is given the subdivider, he/she may be required to reserve sites for parks, playgrounds, open spaces and schools and other public land as determined by the Planning Commission to be sufficient and in compliance with the Comprehensive Plan. Reservation of land for public acquisition and/or use shall be for a period not to exceed three (3) years from the date the plat is officially approved and recorded unless otherwise provided in these regulations.

(1)	Where a park, playground, school or other site for public use shown on the Comprehensive  Plan  is  located  in  whole  or  in  part  in  the  applicant's
 

subdivision, the City may require the acquisition or accept the dedication or reservation of such area within the subdivision.

(2)	Where deemed essential by the Planning Commission upon consideration of the type of development proposed in the subdivision, and especially in largeยญ scale developments not anticipated in the Comprehensive Plan, the City may request the dedication or reservation of such other areas or sites of a character, extent or location suitable to the needs created by such development for school, parks and other neighborhood facilities.

(3)	Where a tract ofland is being subdivided includes land proposed to be used for parks under the duly adopted Comprehensive Plan of the City, the subdivider shall indicate the location of such areas on the subdivision plat.

ยท	(4)             Where a tract ofland is being subdivided includes land proposed to be used for a future school site, under the adopted Comprehensive Plan, the subdivider shall indicate the general location of such areas on the preliminary plat. School sites are to be reserved for two years giving the Community School District the right to purchase the land at a negotiated value or at a value dete1mined in the same manner as required by the Nebraska State Statutes for proceedings under the power of eminent domain, plus one-half the cost of grading, utilities, and paving, including curbs, of any streets contiguous to the site, plus other approved special assessments. Should the school site not be purchased within the time limit specified above, the subdivider may then sell said site for an alternate purpose as shown on the approved subdivision plat.

511.2	DEDICATION: Before final plat approval is given to the subdivider, he/she shall be required to dedicate to the public use all streets, alleys, buffer strips and parks as may be required by the Planning Commission. Acceptance of these dedicated lands shall be recorded in the minutes of the City Council and on the subdivision plat.

SECTION  512	PARKLAND	DEDICATION	AND	PAYMENTS	IN	LIEU	OF DEDICATION

The subdivider who subdivides land shall dedicate a portion of such land, or pay a fee, as set forth in this Article for the purpose of providing park, recreational facilities, and open spaces to serve future residents.

The amount ofland to be dedicated by a subdivider pursuant to this ordinance shall be 5% or
.5	acre, whichever is greater, of the land area comprising the total land area in the proposed subdivision as reflected in the final subdivision plat. If a subdivider so desires, the subdivider may elect to pay a fee in lieu of land dedication, provided, however, the City may reject subdividers election and require land dedication. Where a subdivider is required to pay a fee in lieu of land dedication, the amount of such fee shall be based upon the fair market value of the amount of land
 

comprising the total land area as indicated in the final subdivision plat. The amount of such fee shall be 8% of the fair market value of the total land area comprising the proposed subdivision as indicated in the final subdivision plat.

Fair market value shall be determined as of the time of filing the final plat in accordance with the following:

(1)	The fair market value as determined by the City Council based upon fair market value appraisals considering all of the uses and purposes for which it might reasonably be used; or

(2)	Ifthe subdivider objects to the amount of valuation the subdivider may, at its expense, obtain an appraisal of the property based on the highest and best use of the property by a qualified real estate appraiser approved by the City, which appraisal may be accepted by the City Council if found reasonable; or

(3)	The City and the subdivider may agree as to the fair market value.


The procedure for determining whether the subdivider is to dedicate land or pay a fee shall be as follows:

(1)	At all times, the City Council shall have the power to require land dedication or a fee in lieu ofland dedication, regardless of subdivider's election to dedicate land or pay a fee. The City Council shall not approve any preliminary plat or final plat which has not complied with this ordinance.

(2)	At the time of the filing of the preliminary subdivision plat for approval, the subdivider of the property shall, as a part of such filing, indicate whether subdivider desires to dedicate land for park and recreational purposes, or whether subdivider desires to pay a fee in lieu thereof or provide private recreational areas if accepted by the City Council. If subdivider desires to dedicate land for this purpose, subdivider shall designate the area thereof on the preliminary plat as submitted and all dedicated land shall be contiguous.

(3)	At the time the preliminary plat is submitted for approval, the City Council shall determine as a part of such approval, whether to accept a dedication of land within the subdivision, or a payment of a fee in lieu thereof. The minimum size of a dedication of land for park purposes shall be .5 acre.

(4)	Where a dedication ofland is required, it shall be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of the Subdivisions Regulations. Further the subdivider shall convey the dedicated land to the City by deed, and the deed shall be delivered to the City upon anival of the final plat. The final plat will contain all dedicated park land and the name of the park.
 

(5)	Where fees are required, the same shall be paid and deposited with the City prior to the approval of the final plat, or in the alternative, the subdivider shall pay the fees within twelve months from the date of the approval of the final plat, provided that subdivider furnishes written agreement to pay said fees and personal note for total amount of fees, subject to the approval of the City, to the City prior to the approval of the final plat. The City shall not issue any building permits for construction on more than one-third of the lots in any subdivision until the fees are paid and shall not issue any building pe1mits for construction on any lots after the expiration of the twelve month period until said fees are paid.

(6)	At the time the final plat is approved, and land is dedicated, the City Council shall designate the time when the development of the park and recreational facility shall be commenced.

Land and fees received under this Ordinance shall be used only for the purpose of providing park, recreational facilities and open spaces to serve the approximate area of the subdivision for which received and location of the land and amount of fees shall bear a reasonable relationship to the use of the park, recreational facilities and open spaces by the future inhabitants of the subdivision.

Exceptions: The following subdivisions shall be exempt from mandatory land dedication for park, recreational, and open spaces, or fees in lieu of mandatory dedication of land for park, recreational and open spaces, as follows:

(1) All lot split subdivisions as provided in Article VII, Section 705, of this Subdivision Regulations Ordinance.

(2)	All light or heavy industrial park subdivisions (except those areas specifically designated as parks, recreational areas or open space on the Comprehensive Plan). An industrial park subdivision shall require all of the real estate within the subdivision to be zoned industrial pursuant to the Zoning Ordinances of the City of Blair.

(3)	All agricultural/business and commercial district subdivisions (except those areas specifically designated as parks, recreational areas or openspace on the Comprehensive Plan). An agricultural/business and commercial district subdivision shall require all of the real estate within the subdivision to be zoned business or commercial pursuant to the Zoning Ordinances of the City of Blair.

(4)	All other subdivisions a portion of which are not either contiguous to or located within the city limits of the City of Blair, Nebraska (except those areas specifically designated as parks, recreational areas or open space on the Comprehensive Plan).

SECTION  513	LARGE TRACTS OF PARCELS

When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow for the opening of future streets and logical resubdivision.

TIME LIMITS: Prior to the granting of final plat approval, the subdivider and the Planning Commission shall agree upon a deadline for the completion of all required improvements, such deadline not to exceed two (2) years from the date of final plat approval. The Planning Commission shall have the power to extend that deadline for one (1) additional year where the subdivider can present substantial reason for doing so.

FAILURE  TO  COMPLETE  IMPROVEMENTS:	If any  portion  of  the  required improvements shall fail to be accepted for dedication in compliance with section 610.07 within the allocated time period, either for reason of incompletion or for  reason of substandard  construction,  then  the  City  Council  shall  take  the  following  action: Where improvements have been guaranteed under  Section 610.02 of this Ordinance, the City Council shall declare whatever  security has been pledged as a guarantee to be forfeit.  Where the City Council is not already in possession of said guarantee, it shall immediately take the actions necessary to obtain it. Upon receipt of these securities, the City Council shall use them, or receipts from their sale if that be necessary, to finance the completion of contracted improvements or the rebuilding of such improvements to the proper specifications.  Unused portions of these securities shall be returned to the subdivider, bonding company, or crediting institution, as is
appropriate.

INSPECTION AND CERTIFICATION: The City Engineer, or other knowledgeable official as specified by the Planning Commission, shall regularly inspect for defects in the construction of required improvements. Upon completion of these improvements, the City Engineer shall file with the Planning Commission a statement either certifying that the improvements have been completed in the specific manner or listing the defects in those improvements.

Upon completion of the improvements, the subdivider shall file with the Planning Commission a statement stipulating the following:

(1)	That all required improvements are complete;

(2)	That these improvements  are in compliance with the minimum  standards specified by the Planning Commission for their construction;

(3)	That  the  subdivider  knows  of  no  defects  from  any  cause,  m  those improvements; and
 


(4)	That these improvements are free and clear of any encumbrance or lien. If the City Engineer has certified that the contracted improvements are complete and free from defect, then upon receipt of the other statements and agreements detailed above, the City shall accept the dedication of those improvements. The City may, at its discretion, accept the dedication of any portion of the required improvements, provided that all statements and agreements specified above have been received for that portion of the improvements.

610.8	REDUCTION OF GUARANTEES: Inthose cases where improvement guarantees have been made under Section 610.02 of this Ordinance, the amount of the guarantee may be reduced upon acceptance, in compliance with Section 610.07 of the dedication of a portion of the required improvements.

610.9	RELEASE OF GUARANTEE: Upon acceptance, in accordance with Section 610.07 of the dedication of the final portion of improvements, the City shall authorize the release of the remaining portion of the improvement guarantee.

SECTION 611	OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE

It is the intention of the City to provide no services other than planning and zoning administration to its zoning area beyond the corporate boundaries of the City. Therefore, it will be the obligation of the subdivider to present to the Planning Commission and City Council a precise approach for the provision of these services. Said approach may include the formation of district, homeowners organizations or other methods to operate and provide for long term maintenance and service.  Said approach shall be made binding on the subdivider in a form, agreement, or contract in a manner which is accepted by the City Attorney.
