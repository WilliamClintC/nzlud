his designee shall enter into an agreement providing for extra duty
assignments for which the Borough shall be compensated at the rate set
from time to time by resolution, which rates shall include an additional
administrative fee. Such agreement shall be in accordance with the
following standards:
(1) The party requesting the assignment shall execute and deliver an
agreement in a form approved by the Borough Council by
resolution. The Chief of Police or his designee shall be authorized
to execute any such agreement, provided that is has been
submitted in the form approved by resolution.
(2) The Borough shall be responsible to provide all necessary
insurance coverage as required by law, including but not limited to

personal injury, including death or damage to property which may
arise or result from the Borough's performance under the contract.
(3) The party requesting the assignment of police officers shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Borough from any and all claims
made by said police officers for injury or illness while performing
extra duty assignments for said party. In addition, the party shall
hold the Borough harmless from any and all claims made by any
third party for injury, illness or damage to property arising out of
the extra duty assignment of a police officer.
(4) Any and all extra duty assignments shall be determined and
approved by the Chief of Police or his designee, who shall be
§ 76-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 76-13
1:113
authorized to establish written rules and regulations governing the
utilization of Borough of Spring Lake police officers for contracted
police services by entities other than the Borough. In addition, the
Chief of Police has the authority to determine the appropriateness
of any assignment and, if he does not believe the assignment is
appropriate, he has the authority to deny the request for use of
police officers. The Chief of Police or his designee may assign a
patrol vehicle for use in performing extra duty if and in the event
it is determined that the use of a patrol vehicle is necessary to
perform the contracted duty. In the event a patrol vehicle is used
in performing extra duty, the party requesting such vehicle shall be

voluntary basis in accordance with a system established and
administered by the Chief of Police.

the rate of 12 percent per annum of any amount billed for which
payment has not been made within 15 days. The delinquent party
shall be liable for all costs, fees and attorney's fees associated with
the collection of any amounts due. The Borough has established a
Dedication by Rider Trust Fund for the purposes of collecting such
fees for and paying for extra duty assignments. The Borough
reserves the right to require an advance escrow deposit for any
requesting party if deemed necessary to ensure the prompt and full
payment of all charges due.
B. Suspension or termination of assignment. The Chief of Police or his
designee shall have the authority to order any police officer engaged in
contracted police services within the Borough of Spring Lake to
respond to an emergency situation. The Chief of Police or designee shall
also have the right to order any off-duty assignment to be terminated
whenever said assignment creates an unacceptable risk to the health,
safety and welfare of the off-duty officer and/or to the general public. In
the event that a police officer is assigned to an emergency situation, the
Police Chief or designee shall make notice of that emergency situation,
as well as the time said officer was removed from said off-duty
assignment. In any situation where a contracted police officer is called
to an emergency situation, said the contracting entity shall not be
responsible for the payment of the officer's hourly rate, administrative
fee or any other fees to the Borough of Spring Lake until such time as
said police officer and/or equipment returns to the assignment with the
contracted entity.
C. Exception. This section shall not apply to police officers serving on any
prosecutorial task forces as may from time to time be established or
other duty assignments during which police officers are assisting any
law enforcement agencies.

contributors.
A. Professional business entities are exempt from public bidding
requirements.
B. There is the potential for professional business entities to make
substantial political contributions to the election campaigns of the local
government elected officers who are ultimately responsible for
awarding professional service contracts.
C. Substantial local political contributions from professionals receiving
discretionary contracts from the elected officials who receive such
contributions raise reasonable concerns on the part of taxpayers as to
their trust in the process of local government, as well as the quality or
cost of services received.
D. Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40A:11-5 and N.J.S.A. 40:48-2, municipalities have
the right to establish rules and procedures for contracting with
professional business entities.
E. The policy of the Borough of Spring Lake will be to exclude professional
business entities from contributing to individuals or a political ticket
running for office. If an individual or professional entity makes a
campaign contribution as defined herein they will be ineligible to
receive a public professional service contract from the Borough of
Spring Lake.
A. Any other provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, the
municipality or any of its purchasing agents or agencies, including all
boards and commissions, or any of its independent authorities, as the
case may be, shall not enter into an agreement or otherwise contract to
procure services from any professional business entity, if that entity has
solicited or made any contribution of money, or pledge of a contribution,
including in-kind contributions or purchase of tickets, advertisements
or the like, which proceeds will be used by or on behalf of or, to a
campaign committee of any candidate or holder of the public office
having ultimate responsibility for the award of the contract, or to any
municipal, county or state party committee, which is designated for a
local candidate.21
21.Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
III).
§ 82-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 82-2
1:117
B. No professional business entity which enters into negotiations for, or
agrees to, any contract or agreement with the municipality or any
department, board, commission or agency thereof or of its independent
authorities for the rendition of professional services shall knowingly
solicit or make any contribution of money, or pledge of a contribution,
including in-kind contributions or purchase of tickets, advertisements
or the like, which proceeds will be used by or on behalf of or to:
(1) Any candidate or holder of the public office having ultimate
responsibility for the award of the contract; or
(2) Any municipal party committee; or
(3) Any county or state party committee (unless during the preceding
calendar year no contribution of money or in-kind contribution in
an amount sufficient to require reporting on the local campaign
election law report has been made to the local candidate or
municipal party committee by the state or county committee to
which the professional business entity may have contributed); or
(4) Any political action committee (unless during the preceding
calendar year no contribution of money or in-kind contribution in
an amount sufficient to require reporting on the local campaign
election law report has been made to the local candidate or
political action committee by the state or county committee to
which the professional business entity may have contributed)
between the time of first communications between that business
entity and the Borough regarding a specific professional services
agreement and the later of the termination of negotiations or the
completion of the contract or agreement.
C. For purposes of this article, a "professional business entity" seeking a
public contract means an individual including the individual's spouse, if
any, and any child living at home; person; firm; corporation;
professional corporation; partnership; organization; or association. The
definition of a "business entity" includes all principals who own 10% or
more of the equity in the corporation or business trust; partner; and
officers in the aggregate employed by the entity as well as any
subsidiaries directly controlled by the business entity. This prohibition
shall include contributions from employees if the contribution was
provided by the professional business entity to the employee for the
purpose of subverting the provisions of this article.
D. Office considered to have ultimate responsibility.
(1) For purposes of this subsection, the office that is considered to
have ultimate responsibility for the award of the contract shall be:

1:118
§ 82-3. Contributions made prior to effective date.
No contribution of money or any other thing of value, including in-kind
contributions, made by a professional business entity to any municipal
candidate for Mayor or Council, or municipal party committee, county or
state party committee or political action committee shall be deemed a
violation of this article, nor shall an agreement for property, goods, or
services of any kind whatsoever, be disqualified thereby, if that contribution
was made by the professional business entity prior to the effective date of
this article.
§ 82-4. Contribution statement by professional business entity.
§ 82-5. Retroactivity of future clarifications adopted.
It is anticipated that there may be some professional business entities
which determine to attempt a legalistic adherence to the letter rather
than the spirit of this article. It is the declared intent of this municipal
governing body to remain vigilant to recognize such attempts to subvert the
underlying purposes for which this article was adopted. Any professional
business entity which may attempt such creative subversion does so at
its peril. If and in the event creative actions are taken in order to defeat
the purposes of this article, it is the intention of the governing body to
enact appropriate clarification of this article, which clarification shall be
retroactive to the initial effective date of this article thereby disqualifying
(b) The Mayor, if the contract requires approval of the Mayor, or if
a public officer who is responsible for the award of a contract is
appointed by the Mayor.
(2) However, the restrictions of this article apply to boards,
commissions or agencies of the Borough whose appointments of
professionals either require the approval of the Mayor and/or
Borough Council or whose operating funds are subject to
appropriation by the Borough of Spring Lake.
A. Prior to awarding any contract or agreement to procure services with
any professional business entity, the Borough or any of its purchasing
agents or agencies, as they case may be, shall receive a sworn
statement from the professional business entity made under penalty of
perjury that the bidder or offeror has not made a contribution in
violation of § 82-2 hereof and has not made or solicited contributions
through intermediaries for the purpose of concealing the source of the
contribution(s).
B. The professional business entity shall have a continuing duty to report
any violations of this article that may occur during the negotiation or
duration of a contract. The certification required under this subsection
shall be made prior to entry into the contract or agreement with the
Borough and shall be in addition to any other certifications that may be
required by any other provision of law.
§ 82-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 82-5
1:119
such creative professional business entities from serving the Borough.
Changes to this article which are not for purposes of clarification, but
which are amendments to the provisions hereto, shall become effective
upon adoption and publication according to law.
§ 82-6. Vote necessary for ordinance repeal.
This article may be repealed only upon four affirmative votes of full
membership of the governing body.
§ 82-7. Violations and penalties.
A. All Borough professional service agreements shall provide that it shall
be a breach of the terms of the government contract for a professional
business entity as defined in § 82-2C to violate § 82-2B or to knowingly
conceal or misrepresent contributions given or received, or to make or
solicit contributions through intermediaries for the purpose of
concealing or misrepresenting the source of the contribution.
B. Any professional business entity as defined in § 82-2C who knowingly
fails to reveal a contribution made in violation of this article, or who
knowingly makes or solicits contributions through intermediaries for
the purpose of concealing or misrepresenting the source of the
contribution, shall be disqualified from eligibility for future Borough
contracts for a period of four calendar years form the date of the
violation.

[Adopted by Ord. No. 8-1986 (§ 14-5 of the Revised General
Ordinances)]
§ 114-38. Findings.
The dune areas between the easterly side of Ocean Avenue and the beaches
are vital ingredients in the efforts of the Borough of Spring Lake and
of the State of New Jersey to preserve and to protect the shoreline of
this municipality from erosion by wind and water; and the public interest
demands that the dune areas remain inviolate from trespass by the public
either as an access route to the beaches and boardwalk or for any other
purpose.
§ 114-39. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
DUNE AREAS — Those tracts of land as shown on a certain map prepared
by Birdsall Engineering Inc., South Belmar, New Jersey, William T. Birdsall,
P.E., dated May 9, 1986, and entitled "1986 Dune Ordinance, Borough of
Spring Lake, Monmouth County, New Jersey" and further identified on the
map as Existing Dunes (typical). Further, it is recognized that the dune
areas are not rigid as to the delineation thereof and as a result of natural
forces, the dune areas may shift and migrate, and it is the intention of
this definition to include such locations within this definition. Further, this
definition is also intended to encompass other areas along the beachfront
which either may be constructed or planted for the purpose of preserving
and protecting the shoreline.
NATURAL VEGETATION — Includes the terms "native vegetation" or
"indigenous." Specifically, it shall mean such plants as dune or beach grass,
dusty miller, hudsonia, sea rocket, seaside goldenrod, bayberry or beach
plum and other plants which normally grow or may be planted in the dune
areas as set forth above.
§ 114-40. Prohibitions.

areas for the purposes of maintenance, repair, restoration and planting in
order to preserve and to protect the dune areas in the Borough.

conviction, be liable to the penalty as stated in Chapter 1, Article II, General
Penalty.

canoes and other watercraft (hereinafter referred to as boats) attached
to trees, benches or poles on Borough property while at the same time
providing the owners of such objects with reasonable access to adjacent
bodies of water. These boats with unknown owners take up park space and
make it difficult to maintain the grass in the vicinity. In addition, unattended
boats without identification pose a danger for misuse by juveniles and pose
additional risk of harm in the water. Further the aesthetic qualities of
Spring Lake, Wreck Pond and Como Lake and the surrounding park areas
are deemed to be unsightly without some regulations as to the number of
said boats.
§ 126-7. Boat season.
Boats shall be allowed to be stored on Borough property from April 1 to
October 31 subject to regulations contained herein.

of the boat, and in the case of a canoe, the decal shall be placed on the
starboard aft side of the canoe.

Spring Lake and $75 for nonresidents, payable in advance to the
Borough Clerk with the filing of the registration form.

boat remaining after said date shall be removed by the Borough
employees and shall be stored at a charge to the registrant of $100 for

paid prior to return of the boat to the registrant and the issuance of a
permit for any future year.

occurrence. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit the
acquisition of additional coverage.
E. Borough employees, whenever they remove the abandoned boats, shall
provide the Borough Clerk with a list of the decal numbers of the boats
removed. Notice of failure to remove the boat from the Borough lakes
shall be sent by the Borough Clerk to the registrant by mail directed to
the address of the registrant as it appears on the application. If the boat
is not repossessed by the registrant in accordance with the
requirements of Subsection D for a period of three months, then the
boat will be deemed abandoned and sold at public sale. Any sums
derived from such sale will, after deduction of storage charges and
expenses of sale, be remitted to the registrant.
F. Any boat stored at the lakes shall be located in the designated docking
area(s) and secured utilizing cable or chain with padlock or
combination lock. Any boat located other than in the designated areas
shall be removed by the Borough and the owner will be subject to the
provisions of Subsections E and F above governing the fees for recovery
and storage and the abandonment and sale of such boat.
G. The Borough has the right to remove any chain, cable or lock in case of
an emergency. If the Borough is required to remove said device, in the
event of an emergency, it shall replace the cable, chain or lock. If a

her boat overnight from using the boat on said lakes at any time throughout

Chapter 186
FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
§ 186-1. Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and
objectives.
§ 186-1.1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1, et
seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry. Therefore, the Borough Council of the Borough of Spring
Lake, of Monmouth County, New Jersey does ordain as follows.
§ 186-1.2. Findings of fact.
§ 186-1.3. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. The flood hazard areas of the Borough of Spring Lake are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, causes damage in other
areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;

LOWEST FLOOR — The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
the parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than
a basement is not considered a building's lowest floor provided that such
enclosure is not built so to render the structure in violation of other
applicable non-elevation design requirements.
MANUFACTURED HOME — A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with
or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities.
The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR MANUFACTURED HOME
SUBDIVISION — A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two
or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
NEW CONSTRUCTION — Structures for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted
by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION — A manufactured
home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed
(including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of
streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is
completed on or after the effective date of the floodplain management
regulations adopted by the municipality.
PRIMARY FRONTAL DUNE — A continuous or nearly continuous mound
or ridge of sand with relatively steep seaward and landward slopes
immediately landward and adjacent to the beach and subject to erosion and
overtopping from high tides and waves from coastal storms. The inland limit
of the primary frontal dune occurs at the point where there is a distinct
change from the relatively steep slope to a relatively mild slope.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE — A vehicle which is [i] built on a single chassis;
[ii] 400 square feet or less when measured at the longest horizontal
projections; [iii] designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by
a light duty truck; and [iv] designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel,
or seasonal use.
SAND DUNES — Naturally occurring accumulations of sand in ridges or
mounds landward of the beach.
Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities

START OF CONSTRUCTION — For other than new construction or
substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (P.L.
No. 97-348) includes substantial improvements and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement
was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the
first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site such as
the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction
of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement
of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings or piers, or foundations or the erection
of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property
of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling
units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the
actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling,
floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE — A walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, or a
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE — Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its condition before damage
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood-related
damages sustained by a structure on two or more separate occasions during
a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each flood event,
on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the
structure before the damages occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT — Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure during a 10-year period, the
cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the
structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. Substantial
improvement also means "cumulative substantial improvement." This term
includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless
of the actual repair work performed or repetitive loss. The term does not,
however, include either:
Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations
of State or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which
have been identified by the local code enforcement officer and which
are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
A.
Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".

§ 186-5.1. General standards.
In all areas of special flood hazards, compliance with the applicable
requirements of the Uniform Construction Code (N.J.A.C. 5:23) and the
following standards, whichever is more restrictive, is required:
less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items
in § 186-4.4A(4)(a)—(k) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and,
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public as identified in § 186-4.4A(4) or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
A. Anchoring.
(1) All new construction to be placed or substantially improved and
substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.
§ 186-4.4 SPRING LAKE CODE § 186-5.1

impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding;
and
(4) For all new construction and substantial improvements the
electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air-conditioning
equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components during conditions of flooding.
D. Subdivision and new development proposals.
(1) All subdivision proposals and other proposed new development
shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
(2) All subdivision proposals and other proposed new development
shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize
flood damage;
(3) All subdivision proposals and other proposed new development
shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood
damage; and,
(4) Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed new development which contain at
least 50 lots or five acres (whichever is less).

§ 186-5.2. Specific standards.
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data have
been provided as set forth in § 186-3.2, Basis for establishing the areas of
special flood hazard or in § 186-4.3B, Use of other base flood and floodway
data, the following standards are required:
E. Enclosure openings. All new construction and substantial
improvements having fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that
are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in
an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall
be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs
for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria: A minimum of two openings having a total net area of
not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall
be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped

whichever is more restrictive, plus one foot; and
§ 186-5.1 SPRING LAKE CODE § 186-5.2
1:252
§ 186-5.3. Floodways.
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in § 186-3.2 are
areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
(b) Require within any AO Zone on the municipality's DFIRM that
all new construction and substantial improvement of any
commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall
have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the
highest adjacent grade, one foot above the depth number
specified in feet (at least three feet if no depth number is
specified) or at or above the advisory base flood elevation plus
one foot, whichever is more restrictive. And, require adequate
drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide
floodwaters around and away from proposed structures;
(2) Or:

above the base flood elevation or advisory base flood elevation, plus
one foot (whichever is more restrictive).
A. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development unless a technical evaluation
demonstrates that encroachment shall not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
§ 186-5.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 186-5.3
1:253
§ 186-5.4. Coastal high hazard area.
Coastal high hazard areas (V or VE Zones) are located within the areas
of special flood hazard established in § 186-3.2. These areas have special
flood hazards associated with high velocity waters from tidal surges and
hurricane wave wash; therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
B. If Subsection A above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements must comply with § 186-5, Provisions for flood hazard
reduction.
C. In all areas of special flood hazard in which base flood elevation data
has been provided and no floodway has been designated, the
cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with
all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than 0.2 of a foot at any
point.
A. Location of structures:
(1) All buildings or structures shall be located landward of the reach of
the mean high tide.
(2) The placement of manufactured homes shall be prohibited, except
in an existing manufactured home park or manufactured home
subdivision.

be elevated on pilings or columns so that the bottom of the lowest
horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the
pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood elevation,
advisory base flood elevation or as required by the Uniform
Construction Code (NJAC 5:23), whichever is more restrictive, with
all space below the lowest floor's supporting member open so as
not to impede the flow of water, except for breakaway walls as
provided for in § 186-5.4B(4).
(2) Structural support.
(a) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
securely anchored on pilings or columns.
(b) The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto
shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral
movement due to the effects of wind and water loading values
each of which shall have a one percent chance of being equaled
or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence
interval).
(c) There shall be no fill used for structural support.
§ 186-5.3 SPRING LAKE CODE § 186-5.4
1:254
(3) Certification. A licensed professional engineer or architect shall
develop or review the structural design specifications and plans for
the construction and shall certify that the design and methods of
construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards
of practice for compliance with the provisions of § 186-5.4B(1) and
§ 186-5.4B(2)(a) and (b).
(4) Space below the lowest floor.
(a) Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a
structure started after the enactment of this chapter shall not
enclose the space below the lowest floor unless breakaway
walls, open wood lattice-work or insect screening are used as
provided for in this section.
(b) Breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work or insect screening
shall be allowed below the base flood elevation provided that
they are intended to collapse under wind and water loads
without causing collapse, displacement or other structural
damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting
foundation system. Breakaway walls shall be designed for a
safe loading resistance of not less than 10 and no more than 20
pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed
a design safe loading of 20 pounds per square foot (either by
design or when so required by local or State codes) may be
permitted only if a registered professional engineer or
architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following
conditions.
[1] Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less
than that which would occur during the base flood; and,
[2] The elevated portion of the building and supporting
foundation system shall not be subject to collapse,
displacement or other structural damage due to the effects
of wind and water load acting simultaneously on all
building components (structural and non-structural).
Water loading values used shall be those associated with
the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those
required by applicable State or local building standards.
(c) If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall be
used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage
and not for human habitation.
(d) Prior to construction, plans for any breakaway wall must be
submitted to the Building Subcode Official for approval.
C. Sand dunes. Prohibit manmade alteration of sand dunes within Zones
VE and V on the community's DFIRM which would increase potential
flood damage.

year-round visually impervious screen, at a minimum of four
feet high. Where the screening abuts a driveway or sidewalk,
the height of the screening shall be decreased so as not to

G. (Reserved)49
H. Display of merchandise. [Added 6-24-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-007]
(1) Purpose. The purpose of this subsection is to permit certain
displays in front of stores within the RC and GC Zones, to assist the
merchants to market their merchandise and goods, facilitate the
sale of fresh produce and to enhance the beauty of the Borough of
Spring Lake. Retail experts report that businesses that have
appropriate merchandise displays outside their businesses
experience as much as 50% more business than those that do not.
Such displays, done tastefully, add to the sense of vitality and
welcoming of a business district. At the same time, it is necessary
to maintain the quality of the commercial districts. In addition,
many communities have instituted farmers markets in order to
encourage the consumption of fresh produce, increase activity in
their commercial districts and support an increased sense of
community. Existing food retailers can provide some of the benefits
of such a market with a display of fresh produce in front of their
stores.
(2) Rules and regulations.
(a) Merchandise, inventory and goods which are offered for sale
within a store may be displayed in front of the exterior
storefront within the sidewalk right-of-way and on privately
owned property in the GC and RC Zones during the store's
operating hours from May 1 through December 31.
(b) Plants, cut flowers, greens and other such vegetative matter
may be used as decorative material in a store's outside display
even if such items are not sold in the store.

decorative carts. Packing cartons, cardboard boxes, bins, card
tables, folding tables or similar display supports are
prohibited. Clothing cannot be displayed on racks, but may be
displayed on a mannequin. There shall be no more than one
mannequin per store. The clothing shall be worn by the
mannequin, not merely draped upon it. There shall be no more
than one item of merchandise displayed per store that exceeds
four feet in length and one foot in width throughout the fourfoot

A. No open space provided around any principal building for the purposes
of complying with the front, side, rear or other yard provisions of this
chapter shall be considered as providing the yard provisions for any
other principal building.
B. Any structure located on a corner lot shall be set back from both streets
at least the required front yard distance. Structures located on a corner
lots in the R-2 Zone District shall be in accordance with the provisions
set forth within Note 7 of § 225-12D Area and yard requirements.
[Amended 3-26-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-001]
C. Structural projections customarily attached and appurtenant to a
building or structure such as steps, window wells, areaways, light
fixtures, cornices, eaves, gutters, sills, and chimneys are permitted to
project or encroach into the minimum required setback up to a
maximum of 24 inches. [Amended 11-25-2008 by Ord. No.
2008-010; 4-10-2012 by Ord. No. 2012-005]
D. Buildings and structures shall not be located or encroach in any portion
of a front yard, except that incidental items such as light posts,
mailboxes and flagpoles shall be permitted in front yards. [Added
11-25-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-012]
E. Accessory buildings and structures may be located in side and rear yard
areas only, subject to the requirements and limitations of this chapter.
A. Materials designated in Chapter 315, Article II, Recycling Program,
shall be separated from other solid waste by the generator thereof and
a storage area for such recyclable materials shall be provided as
follows:
(1) Single-family homes. Space should be allowed in the kitchen,
laundry room, basement or the garage for storage of recyclables.
Approximately three square feet of floor area will adequately hold a
week's accumulation of recyclables. Municipalities with biweekly
or monthly collection may need to allow extra space for material
storage. This is enough space to hold either a three-tier unit of
three or four five-gallon buckets.
(2) Condominiums/townhouses/apartment buildings. Each individual
unit should be designed to accommodate a week's accumulation of
paper, glass and metals. This can be accomplished by allowing
space under the sink area or in a closet for a three-tier stacking
unit or for five-gallon buckets. This would occupy only three square
feet of floor area and would give residents a convenient area for
storing their recyclables. A central location should be provided so
that residents can drop off their source-separated recyclables for
storage until collection occurs. A suggested location for these sites
§ 225-30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 225-31
1:357
would be near the refuse receptacle units. These could be outdoor
recycling bins located near the refuse units or in a common area of
the condominium units, e.g., near the laundry room. These storage
areas should be easily accessible for the residents of the building
to drop off their materials. They should also be planned with truck
access in mind in order to facilitate loading of materials for delivery
to markets. In a multistory building, a space provided on each floor
will produce the highest participation rates. The bins should be
clearly labeled so it is obvious they are for recyclables and not
trash.
(3) Commercial establishments. Developers of commercial
establishments generating a homogenous waste stream must have
a plan for recycling these materials. The most likely materials will
be office paper, corrugated containers, glass, tin cans and food
waste. In order to determine the amount of space required, cubicyard
equivalents have been given for the number of bottles or cans.
(4) Office paper. The average office worker generates 3/4 pounds of
office paper per week. The loading dock areas should be designed
for interim storage of Gaylord containers or hampers. These
containers are approximately four feet by four feet by four feet and
hold approximately 500 pounds of paper. The size of the storage
area required will be dependent on the number of workers in the
buildings and the frequency with which the vendor picks up the
materials.
(5) Corrugated containers. Because corrugated is a particularly bulky
item for disposal, it needs to be flattened and baled, compacted or
tied in bundles. Space will be required for storage of materials
prior to pickup by either a paper vendor or a recycling contractor.
The amount of space required for storage will depend on the
amount of material generated by the establishment, and whether
the material is baled, tied in bundles or stored in a compactor.
(6) Glass. The simplest method for storing glass, after it has been
separated by color, is by purchasing or leasing a glass crusher. This
will obviously allow more glass to be stored in a smaller space. If
this is not available, glass will need to be rinsed, color separated
and stored in fifty-five-gallon drums, in small dumpsters or in fourby-
four-by-four pallet boxes which can be loaded by a fork lift.
There are approximately three twelve-ounce bottles in a pound,
and one cubic yard of whole bottles weighs 600 pounds or
approximately 900 twelve-ounce bottles.
(7) Tin cans. A commercial establishment generating ferrous (tinplated
steel) cans, which are used for food storage, in large
quantities may be required to recycle them. For sanitary reasons,
cans should be rinsed before storing. There are approximately 12
cans in a pound and approximately 1,800 cans in a cubic yard.

ARTICLE VA
Affordable Housing
[Added 2-26-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-02]
§ 225-31.2. Affordable Housing Programs.
The Borough shall use the following mechanisms to satisfy its affordable
housing obligations:
A. Percentage of Mandatory Set Asides for All Future Residential
Developments.
(1) If the Borough permits the construction of multi-family residential
developments, the Borough shall require that an appropriate
percentage of the residential units be set aside for low and
moderate-income households. This requirement shall apply
beginning with the effective date of this ordinance to any multifamily
development, including the residential portion of a mixeduse
development, which consists of five or more new residential
units, whether permitted by a zoning amendment, a variance
granted by the Borough's Planning or Zoning Board, or adoption of
a Redevelopment Plan or amended Redevelopment Plan in areas in
need of redevelopment or rehabilitation. For inclusionary projects
in which the low and moderate units are to be offered for sale, the
appropriate set-aside percentage shall be 20 percent; for projects
in which the low and moderate-income units are to be offered for
rent, the appropriate set-aside percentage shall be 15 percent. This
requirement does not create any entitlement for a property owner
or applicant for a zoning amendment, variance, or adoption of a
Redevelopment Plan or amended Redevelopment Plan in areas in
need of redevelopment or rehabilitation, or for approval of any
particular proposed project.
(2) This requirement does not apply to residential expansions,
additions, renovations, replacement, or any other type of
residential development that does not result in a net increase in the
number of dwellings of five or more.
(3) Furthermore, this section shall not apply to developments
containing four or less dwelling units. All subdivision and site plan
approvals of qualifying residential developments shall be
conditioned upon compliance with the provisions of this section.
Where a developer demolishes existing dwelling units and builds
new dwelling units on the same site, the provisions of this section
shall apply only if the net number of dwelling units is five or more.
(4) The above standards shall not apply in the Mixed-Use Affordable
Housing Overlay Zone ("MUAHOZ"). [Added 4-23-2019 by Ord.
No. 2019-08]
§ 225-31.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 225-31.2
1:363
§ 225-31.3. New Affordable Housing Construction.
The following general guidelines apply to all newly constructed
developments that contain low-and moderate-income housing units,
including any currently unanticipated future developments that will provide
low- and moderate-income housing units.
B. Phasing. Inclusionary developments shall be subject to the following
schedule, except where an alternate phasing schedule has been
incorporated into a development or redevelopment agreement:
Minimum Percentage of Lowand
Moderate-Income Units
Completed
Maximum Percentage of
Market-Rate Units Completed
0% 25%
10% 25% + 1 Unit
50% 50%
75% 75%
100% 90%
C. Fractional Units. If 15% or 20% of the total number of units in a
development results in a fraction or decimal, the developer shall be
required to provide an additional affordable unit on site.
Example: an 8-unit development requiring an affordable housing setaside
of 1.6 units is proposed. The developer is required to provide two
on-site affordable units. [Amended 4-23-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-08]
D. Design. In inclusionary developments, to the extent possible, low- and
moderate-income units shall be integrated with the market units.
E. Off-site construction. The standards for constructing affordable units
off-site, shall be in accordance with the Borough's recommendations,
provided that at least the same number of affordable units are provided,
not more than 25% are age-restricted, standard phasing requirements
between market rate and affordable Certificates of Occupancy are
adhered to, and the affordable units provided are otherwise consistent
with the terms of the Settlement Agreement. [Amended 4-23-2019 by
Ord. No. 2019-08]
F. Utilities. Affordable units shall utilize the same type of heating source
as market units within the affordable development.
A. Low/Moderate Split and Bedroom Distribution of Affordable Housing
Units:
(1) The fair share obligation shall be divided equally between low- and
moderate-income units, except that where there is an odd number
of affordable housing units, the extra unit shall be a low-income
unit.
§ 225-31.2 SPRING LAKE CODE § 225-31.3
1:364
(2) In each affordable development, at least 50% of the restricted units
within each bedroom distribution shall be low-income units. If
there is only one affordable unit it must be a low-income unit.
(3) The Borough Housing Element and Fair Share Plan requires that
13% of all affordable units approved or constructed since July 17,
2008 in the Borough shall be designated as very-low income
households at 30% of the median income, with at least 50% of all
very-low income units being available to families. While this
requirement applies to the entirety of the Borough's affordable
housing percentage and it may not be imposed on each project
individually, its application to each project will be evaluated on a
case by case basis and may be imposed as a requirement of a newly
constructed development.
(4) Affordable developments that are not age-restricted shall be
structured in conjunction with realistic market demands such that:
(a) The combined number of efficiency and one-bedroom units
shall be no greater than 20% of the total low- and moderateincome
units;
(b) At least 30% of all low- and moderate-income units shall be
two-bedroom units;
(c) At least 20% of all low- and moderate-income units shall be
three-bedroom units; and
(d) The remaining units may be allocated among two and threebedroom
units at the discretion of the developer.
B. Accessibility Requirements:
(1) The first floor of all restricted townhouse dwelling units and all
restricted units in all other multistory buildings shall be subject to
the technical design standards of the Barrier Free Sub-code,
N.J.A.C. 5:23-7.
(2) All restricted townhouse dwelling units and all restricted units in
other multistory buildings in which a restricted dwelling unit is
attached to at least one other dwelling unit shall have the following
features:
(a) An adaptable toilet and bathing facility on the first floor;
(b) An adaptable kitchen on the first floor;
(c) An interior accessible route of travel on the first floor;
(d) An interior accessible route of travel shall not be required
between stories within an individual unit;
§ 225-31.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 225-31.3
1:365
(e) An adaptable room that can be used as a bedroom, with a door
or the casing for the installation of a door, on the first floor;
and
(f) An accessible entranceway as set forth at P.L. 2005, c. 350
(N.J.S.A. 52:27D-311a et seq.) and the Barrier Free Sub-code,
N.J.A.C. 5:23-7, or evidence that the Borough of Spring Lake
has collected funds from the developer enough to make 10% of
the adaptable entrances in the development accessible:
[1] Where a unit has been constructed with an adaptable
entrance, upon the request of a disabled person who is
purchasing or will reside in the dwelling unit, an
accessible entrance shall be installed.
[2] To this end, the builder of restricted units shall deposit
funds within the Borough's Affordable Housing Trust Fund
sufficient to install accessible entrances in 10% of the
affordable units that have been constructed with
adaptable entrances.
[3] The funds deposited under paragraph B. above shall be
used by the Borough of Spring Lake for the sole purpose of
making the adaptable entrance of any affordable unit
accessible when requested to do so by a person with a
disability who occupies or intends to occupy the unit and
requires an accessible entrance.
[4] The developer of the restricted units shall submit a design
plan and cost estimate for the conversion from adaptable
to accessible entrances to the Construction Official of the
Borough.
[5] Once the Construction Official has determined that the
design plan to convert the unit entrances from adaptable
to accessible meet the requirements of the Barrier Free
Sub-code, N.J.A.C. 5:23-7, and that the cost estimate of
such conversion is reasonable, payment shall be made to
the Borough's affordable housing trust fund where the
funds shall be deposited into the affordable housing trust
fund and appropriately earmarked.
[6] Full compliance with the foregoing provisions shall not be
required where an entity can demonstrate that it is site
impracticable to meet the requirements. Determinations of
site impracticability shall be in compliance with the
Barrier Free Sub-code, N.J.A.C. 5:23-7.
C. Maximum Rents and Sales Prices
(1) In establishing rents and sales prices of affordable housing units,
the Administrative Agent shall follow the procedures set forth in
§ 225-31.3 SPRING LAKE CODE § 225-31.3
1:366
UHAC utilizing the regional income limits established by the New
Jersey Department of Community Affairs (DCA) or other agency as
required by the Court.
(2) The maximum rent for restricted rental units within each
affordable development and the average rent for restricted lowand
moderate-income units shall be calculated in accordance with
UHAC regulations.
(3) The developers and/or municipal sponsors of restricted rental units
shall establish at least one rent for each bedroom type for both lowincome
and moderate-income units.
(4) The maximum sales price of restricted ownership units within each
affordable development shall be calculated in accordance with
UHAC regulations, and each affordable development must achieve
an affordability average shall be calculated in accordance with
UHAC regulations, moderate-income ownership units must be
available for at least three different prices for each bedroom type,
and low-income ownership units must be available for at least two
different prices for each bedroom type.
(5) In determining the initial sales prices and rents for compliance with
the affordability average requirements for restricted units other
than assisted living facilities, the following standards shall be used:
(a) A studio shall be affordable to a one-person household;
(b) A one-bedroom unit shall be affordable to a one and one-half
person household;
(c) A two-bedroom unit shall be affordable to a three-person
household;
(d) A three-bedroom unit shall be affordable to a four and one-half
person household; and
(e) A four-bedroom unit shall be affordable to a six-person
household.
(6) In determining the initial rents for compliance with the
affordability average requirements for restricted units in assisted
living facilities, the following standards shall be used:
(a) A studio shall be affordable to a one-person household;
(b) A one-bedroom unit shall be affordable to a one and one-half
person household; and
(c) A two-bedroom unit shall be affordable to a two-person
household or to two one-person households.
(7) The initial purchase price for all restricted ownership units shall be
calculated so that the monthly carrying cost of the unit, including
§ 225-31.3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 225-31.3
1:367
§ 225-31.4. Occupancy Standards for Affordable Housing.
principal and interest (based on a mortgage loan equal to 95% of
the purchase price and the Federal Reserve H.15 rate of interest),
taxes, homeowner and private mortgage insurance and
condominium or homeowner association fees do not exceed 28%
of the eligible monthly income of the appropriate size household
as determined under N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.4, as may be amended and
supplemented; provided, however, that the price shall be subject to
the affordability average requirement of N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.3, as may
be amended and supplemented.
(8) The initial rent for a restricted rental unit shall be calculated so as
not to exceed 30 percent of the eligible monthly income of the
appropriate household size as determined under N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.4,
as may be amended and supplemented; provided, however, that the
rent shall be subject to the affordability average requirement of
N.J.A.C. 5:80- 26.3, as may be amended and supplemented.
(9) The price of owner-occupied low- and moderate-income units may
increase annually based on the percentage increase in the regional
median income limit for each housing region. In no event shall the
maximum resale price established by the Administrative Agent be
lower than the last recorded purchase price.
(10) The rent of low- and moderate-income units may be increased
annually based on the percentage increase in the Housing
Consumer Price Index for the United States. This increase shall not
exceed 9% in any one year. Rents for units constructed pursuant to
low- income housing tax credit regulations shall be indexed
pursuant to the regulations governing low- income housing tax
credits.
(11) Utilities. Tenant-paid utilities that are included in the utility
allowance shall be so stated in the lease and shall be consistent
with the utility allowance approved by DCA for its Section 8
program.
A. In referring certified households to specific restricted units, to the
extent feasible, and without causing an undue delay in occupying the
unit, the Administrative Agent shall strive to:
(1) Provide an occupant for each bedroom;
(2) Provide children of different sex with separate bedrooms; and
(3) Prevent more than two persons from occupying a single bedroom.
B. Additional provisions related to occupancy standards (if any) shall be
provided in the municipal Operating Manual.

§ 225-31.5. Control Periods for Affordable Housing Restricted
Ownership Units and Enforcement Mechanisms.
A. Control periods for restricted ownership units shall be in accordance
with N.J.A.C. 5:80- 26.5, as may be amended and supplemented, and
each restricted ownership unit shall remain subject to the requirements
of this Ordinance until the Borough of Spring Lake elects to release the
unit from such requirements however, and prior to such an election, a
restricted ownership unit must remain subject to the requirements of
N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.1, as may be amended and supplemented, for at least
30 years.
B. The affordability control period for a restricted ownership unit shall
commence on the date the initial certified household takes title to the
unit.
C. Prior to the issuance of the initial certificate of occupancy for a
restricted ownership unit and upon each successive sale during the
period of restricted ownership, the Administrative Agent shall
determine the restricted price for the unit and shall also determine the
non-restricted, fair market value of the unit based on either an
appraisal or the unit's equalized assessed value.
D. At the time of the first sale of the unit, the purchaser shall execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent a recapture note obligating the
purchaser (as well as the purchaser's heirs, successors and assigns) to

have all remedies provided at law or equity, including but not limited to
foreclosure, tenant eviction, municipal fines, a requirement for

mortgage, recoupment of any funds from a sale in the violation of the
regulations, injunctive relief to prevent further violation of the
regulations, entry on the premises, and specific performance.
B. After providing written notice of a violation to an Owner, Developer or
Tenant of a low- or moderate-income unit and advising the Owner,
Developer or Tenant of the penalties for such violations, the
municipality may take the following action against the Owner,
Developer or Tenant for any violation that remains uncured for a period
of 60 days after service of the written notice:
(1) The Borough may file a court action pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:58-11
alleging a violation, or violations, of the regulations governing the
affordable housing unit. If the Owner, Developer or Tenant is found
by the court to have violated any provision of the regulations
governing affordable housing units the Owner, Developer or Tenant
shall be subject to one or more of the following penalties, at the
discretion of the court:
(a) A fine of not more than $10,000.00 or imprisonment for a

moderate-income unit in violation of the regulations governing
affordable housing units, payment into the Borough of Spring
§ 225-31.13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 225-31.14
1:375
Lake Affordable Housing Trust Fund of the gross amount of
rent illegally collected;
(c) In the case of an Owner who has rented his or her low- or
moderate-income unit in violation of the regulations governing
affordable housing units, payment of an innocent tenant's
reasonable relocation costs, as determined by the court.
(2) The Borough may file a court action in the Superior Court seeking a
judgment, which would result in the termination of the Owner's
equity or other interest in the unit, in the nature of a mortgage
foreclosure. Any judgment shall be enforceable as if the same were
a judgment of default of the First Purchase Money Mortgage and
shall constitute a lien against the low- and moderate-income unit.
C. Such judgment shall be enforceable, at the option of the Borough, by
means of an execution sale by the Sheriff, at which time the low- and
moderate-income unit of the violating Owner shall be sold at a sale
price which is not less than the amount necessary to fully satisfy and
pay off any First Purchase Money Mortgage and prior liens and the
costs of the enforcement proceedings incurred by the municipality,
including attorney's fees. The violating Owner shall have the right to
possession terminated as well as the title conveyed pursuant to the
Sheriff's sale.
D. The proceeds of the Sheriff's sale shall first be applied to satisfy the
First Purchase Money Mortgage lien and any prior liens upon the lowand
moderate-income unit. The excess, if any, shall be applied to
reimburse the municipality for any and all costs and expenses incurred
in connection with either the court action resulting in the judgment of
violation or the Sheriff's sale. In the event that the proceeds from the
Sheriff's sale are insufficient to reimburse the municipality in full as
aforesaid, the violating Owner shall be personally responsible for and to
the extent of such deficiency, in addition to any and all costs incurred by
the municipality in connection with collecting such deficiency. In the
event that a surplus remains after satisfying all of the above, such
surplus, if any, shall be placed in escrow by the municipality for the
Owner and shall be held in such escrow for a maximum period of two
years or until such earlier time as the Owner shall make a claim with
the municipality for such. Failure of the Owner to claim such balance
within the two-year period shall automatically result in a forfeiture of
such balance to the municipality. Any interest accrued or earned on
such balance while being held in escrow shall belong to and shall be
paid to the municipality, whether such balance shall be paid to the
Owner or forfeited to the municipality.
E. Foreclosure by the Borough due to violation of the regulations
governing affordable housing units shall not extinguish the restrictions
of the regulations governing affordable housing units as the same apply
to the low- and moderate-income unit. Title shall be conveyed to the
purchaser at the Sheriff's sale, subject to the restrictions and provisions
§ 225-31.14 SPRING LAKE CODE § 225-31.14
1:376
§ 225-31.15. Use of funds.

The Borough shall submit a monitoring report to the Court as set forth in its
settlement agreement with Fair Share Housing Center.
§ 225-31.17. Spending plan.
of the regulations governing the affordable housing unit. The Owner
determined to be in violation of the provisions of this plan and from
whom title and possession were taken by means of the Sheriff's sale
shall not be entitled to any right of redemption.
F. If there are no bidders at the Sheriff's sale, or if insufficient amounts
are bid to satisfy the First Purchase Money Mortgage and any prior
liens, the municipality may acquire title to the low- and moderateincome
unit by satisfying the First Purchase Money Mortgage and any
prior liens and crediting the violating owner with an amount equal to
the difference between the First Purchase Money Mortgage and any
prior liens and costs of the enforcement proceedings, including legal
fees and the maximum resale price for which the low- and moderateincome
unit could have been sold under the terms of the regulations
governing affordable housing units. This excess shall be treated in the
same manner as the excess which would have been realized from an
actual sale as previously described.
G. Failure of the low- and moderate-income unit to be either sold at the
Sheriff's sale or acquired by the municipality shall obligate the Owner
to accept an offer to purchase from any qualified purchaser which may
be referred to the Owner by the municipality, with such offer to
purchase being equal to the maximum resale price of the low- and
moderate-income unit as permitted by the regulations governing
affordable housing units.
H. The Owner shall remain fully obligated, responsible and liable for
complying with the terms and restrictions of governing affordable
housing units until such time as title is conveyed from the Owner.
A. The Borough shall submit to the Court a spending plan for the
development fees collected by it prior to the expiration of its Judgment
of Compliance. Plans to spend development fees shall consist of the
following information:
(1) A municipality may use revenues collected from development fees
for any activity approved by the Council for addressing the
municipal fair share. Such activities include, but are not limited to:
rehabilitation, new construction, ECHO housing, purchase of land
§ 225-31.14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 225-31.17
1:377

be used for low and moderate income housing, extensions and/
or improvements of roads and infrastructure to low and moderate
income housing sites, assistance designed to render units to be
more affordable and administration of the implementation of the
housing element. The Borough shall also be permitted to use
development fee revenues to attract other funds such as, but not
limited to, available public subsidies and funds from private
lending institutions.
(2) Funds shall not be expended to reimburse municipalities for past
housing activities.
(3) At least 30% of the revenues collected from development fees shall
be devoted to render units more affordable. Examples of such
activities include, but are not limited to, down payment assistance,
low interest loans, and rental assistance. Development fees
collected to finance a rehabilitation program or a new construction
project shall be exempt from this requirement. This requirement
may be waived in whole or in part when the municipality
demonstrates the ability to address the requirement of affordability
assistance from another source.
(4) Municipalities may contract with a private or public entity to
administer the implementation of any part of its housing element,
including the requirement for affordability assistance.
(5) No more than 20% of the revenues collected from development fees
shall be expended on administration, including, but not limited to,
salaries and benefits for municipal employees or consultant fees
necessary to develop or implement: a rehabilitation program; a
new construction program; an RCA; a housing element; and an
affirmative marketing program. Administrative funds may be used
for: income qualification of households; monitoring the turnover of
sale and rental units; and compliance with Council monitoring
requirements. Development fees shall not be used to defray the
costs of existing staff. Development fee administrative costs are
calculated and may be expended at the end of each year or upon
receipt of the fees.

treatment, potable water supply, utilities and building structure
location(s) and orientation(s).
A. Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to establish
guidelines for the siting of wireless telecommunications towers and
antennas and ancillary facilities. The goals of this section are to: (1)
protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts
of towers and antennas; (2) encourage the location of towers on
Borough owned property where appropriate or in other nonresidential
areas; (3) minimize the total number of towers throughout the
community; (4) strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing
tower sites as a primary option rather than construction of additional
single-use towers; (5) encourage the use of existing buildings,
telecommunication towers, light or utility poles, or water towers as
opposed to construction of new telecommunication towers; (6)
encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent
possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is
minimal; (7) ensure that all telecommunication facilities, including
towers, antennas and ancillary facilities are located and designed to
minimize the visual impact on the immediate surroundings and
throughout the community by encouraging users of towers and

landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques; (8)
enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services
to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and
efficiently; (9) consider the public health and safety of
telecommunication towers; and (10) avoid potential damage to adjacent
properties from tower failure through engineering and careful siting
of tower structures. In furtherance of these purposes, the Borough
of Spring Lake shall give due consideration to the Borough of Spring

monopole or lattice framework designed to support transmitting and
receiving antennas. For purposes of this section, amateur radio
transmission facilities and facilities used exclusively for the
transmission of television and radio signals are not transmission
towers.
WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS — Any personal wireless services as
defined in the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 which includes
FCC licensed commercial wireless telecommunications services
including cellular, personal communication services (PCS), specialized
mobile radio (SMR), enhanced specialized mobile radio (ESMR),
paging, and similar services that currently exist or that may in the
future be developed. It does not include any amateur radio facility that
is owned and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station
operator or is used exclusively for receive only antennas, nor does it
include noncellular telephone service.
C. Applicability.
(1) New towers and antennas. All new telecommunications towers or
antennas in the Borough of Spring Lake shall be subject to these
regulations.
(2) Preexisting towers or antennas. Preexisting telecommunications
towers and preexisting antennas shall not be required to meet the
requirements of this section, other than the requirements of
Subsections J and K absent any enlargement or structural
modification or the addition of any antennas.
(3) District height limitations. The requirements set forth in this
section shall govern the location of telecommunications towers that
exceed, and antennas that are installed at a height in excess of, the
height limitations specified for each zoning district.
(4) Public property. Antennas or towers located on property owned,
leased or otherwise controlled by the governing authority shall be
encouraged, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna
or tower has been approved by resolution by the governing
authority. Said approved publicly owned site utilized for the
purposes of constructing towers and/or antennas shall be treated
as engaging in a conditional use under this section.
§ 225-33 SPRING LAKE CODE § 225-33
1:382
(5) Amateur radio station operators/receive only antennas. This
section shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any
antenna, that is under 50 feet in height and is owned and operated
by a federally licensed amateur radio station operator or is used
exclusively for receive only antennas.
(6) Satellite dish antennas. This section shall not govern any parabolic
dish antennas used for transmission or reception of radio signals
associated with satellites.
D. General requirements.
(1) Principal or accessory use. Telecommunications antennas and
towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses.
Notwithstanding any other Borough land use regulation, a different
existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation
of an antenna or tower on such lot. If a tower and its appurtenant
structures constitute the sole use of the lot, the tower shall be
deemed to be the principal use.
(2) Lot size. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a
tower or antenna complies with zone development regulations,
including but not limited to setback requirements, lot coverage
requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the
entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be
located on leased parcels within such lot.
(3) State or federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed
current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any
other agency of the state or federal government with the authority
to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations
are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed
by this section shall bring such towers and antennas into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations within 90
days of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless
a different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling
state or federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall
constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the
owner's expense.
(4) Building codes: safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity
of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in
compliance with standards contained in applicable state or local
Building Codes and the applicable standards for towers that are
published by the Electronic Industries Association and
Telecommunications Industry Association, as amended from time to
time. Owner shall provide a certification from a structural engineer,
licensed by the State of New Jersey, certifying the structural
integrity of the tower not less than every two years. If, upon
inspection, the Borough of Spring Lake concludes that a tower fails
§ 225-33 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 225-33
1:383
to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger
to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the
owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such
tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such
tower into compliance within said 30 days shall constitute grounds
for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense.
(5) No essential services. Telecommunications towers and antennas
shall be regulated and permitted pursuant to this section and shall
not be regulated or permitted as essential services, public utilities,
or private utilities.
(6) Collocation required. The Borough of Spring Lake mandates that
carriers collocate antennas on towers and other structures
whenever possible. See Subsection G for collocation requirements.
(7) Conditional use. All telecommunications facilities shall be
conditional uses in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-67.
(8) Site plan required. Site plan approval shall be required for all new
telecommunications facilities in the Borough of Spring Lake
including modifications to or addition of new telecommunications
facilities to preexisting towers, buildings or other structures.
E. Use regulations.
(1) Conditional use. Wireless telecommunications facilities are
permitted as conditional uses:
(a) On lands owned by Spring Lake Borough or any other public
entity within the Borough of Spring Lake.
(b) In the GC Zoning District.
(2) Conditional use standard. Wireless telecommunications facilities
may be permitted on the above-referenced lands, provided that:
(a) The minimum lot size on which the telecommunications facility
is to be located is at least 1/2 acre in area.
(b) Lattice towers and any type of guyed tower are prohibited.
(c) Telecommunications towers shall be limited to monopolies
without guys designed to ultimately accommodate at least
three carriers and shall meet the following height and usage
criteria:
[1] For a single carrier, up to 75 feet in height;
[2] For two or more carriers, up to 100 feet in height; and
(3) Factors considered in granting conditional use permits.
§ 225-33 SPRING LAKE CODE § 225-33
1:384
(a) In addition to the above standards, the Planning Board shall
consider the following factors in determining whether to issue
a conditional use permit:
[1] Proximity of the tower to residential structures and
residential district boundaries;
[2] Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
[3] Surrounding topography;
[4] Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
[5] Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or
eliminating visual obtrusiveness including stealth designs
which are encouraged;
[6] Availability of suitable existing towers, alternative tower
structures, other structures or alternative technologies
not requiring the use of towers or structures;
[7] Availability of proposed tower to other potential carriers.
(b) This list is considered to be illustrative in nature and may not
include all factors to be considered.
F. Site design standards. The following site design standards shall apply to
wireless telecommunications facilities:
(1) New towers:
(a) Telecommunications towers may not be located closer than 50
feet to any residential property. Antennas located on
preexisting buildings or structures are exempt from this
requirement.
(b) Fall zone. A fall zone shall be established such that the tower is
set back 125% of the height of the tower from any adjoining lot
line or non-appurtenant building.
(c) Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing
not less than six feet in height. Towers shall also be equipped
with appropriate anti-climbing measures.
(d) Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the
landscaping surrounding towers:
[1] Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant
materials that effectively screens the view of the tower
compound from property used for residences or planned
residences or any other area frequented by the public. The
standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least
10 feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound.
§ 225-33 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 225-33
1:385
However, at a minimum, the facility should be shielded
from public view by evergreen trees at least eight feet high
at planting and planted in staggered double rows 15 feet
on center.
[2] In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be
minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced at
the sole discretion of the approving authority.
[3] Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the
site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible.
(e) Ancillary buildings. Any proposed building enclosing related
electronic equipment shall not be more than 10 feet in height
nor more than 200 square feet in area, and only one such
building shall be permitted on the lot for each provider of
wireless telecommunication services located on the site. Such

requirements for accessory structures.
(f) Aesthetic. Towers and antennas shall meet the following
requirements:
[1] Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or,
subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted
a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
[2] At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related
structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials,
colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will
blend them into the natural setting and surrounding
buildings.
(g) Lighting. No lighting is permitted except as follows, which
shall be subject to review and approval by the Planning Board
as part of the site plan application:
[1] The building enclosing electronic equipment may have one
light at the entrance to the building, provided that the
light is attached to the building, is focused downward,
properly shielded and is switched so that the light is
turned on only when workers are at the building; and
[2] No lighting is permitted on a tower except lighting that
specifically is required by the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA), and any such required lighting shall
be focused and shielded to the greatest extent possible so
as not to project towards adjacent and nearby properties.
(h) Signs. No signs are permitted except those required by the
Federal Communications Commission, the Electronic
Industries Association (ELIA) and and/or the
§ 225-33 SPRING LAKE CODE § 225-33
1:386
Telecommunication Industry Association (TIA) or by law, such
as warning and equipment information signs.
(i) All ground-mounted telecommunication towers shall be selfsupported
monopoles and must be capable of withstanding
hurricane-force winds of 140 miles per hour.
(2) Antennas mounted on existing structures or roof tops.
(a) Antennas on existing structures. Any antenna which is not
attached to a tower may be attached to any existing business,
industrial, office, utility or institutional structure in the GC
Zoning District, provided that:
[1] Side- and roof-mounted personal wireless service facilities
shall not project more than 10 feet above the height of an
existing building or structure nor project more than 10
feet above the height limit of the zoning district within
which the facility is located. Personal wireless service
facilities may locate on a building or structure that is
legally nonconforming with respect to height, provided
that the facilities do not project above the existing building
or structure height.
[2] The antenna complies with all applicable FCC and FAA
regulations.
[3] The antenna complies with all applicable Building Codes.
[4] The equipment structure shall not contain more than 200
square feet of gross floor area or be more than 10 feet in
height. In addition, for buildings and structures which are
less than 40 feet in height, the related unmanned
equipment structure shall be located on the ground and
shall not be located on the roof of the structure.
[a] If the equipment structure is located on the roof of a
building, the area of the equipment structure and
other equipment and structures shall not occupy more
than 10% of the roof area.
[b] Equipment storage buildings, structures or cabinets
shall comply with all applicable Building Codes.
(b) Aesthetics. If an antenna is installed on a structure other than
a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical
equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to or
closely compatible with the color of the supporting structure so
as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually
unobtrusive as possible.
(3) Antennas on existing towers. An antenna may be attached to a
preexisting tower and, to minimize adverse visual impacts
§ 225-33 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 225-33
1:387
associated with the proliferation and clustering of towers,
collocation of antennas by more than one carrier on existing towers
shall take precedence over the construction of new towers,
provided that such collocation is accomplished in a manner
consistent with the following:
(a) A tower which is modified or reconstructed to accommodate
the collocation of an additional antenna shall be of the same
tower type as the existing tower, unless reconstruction as a
monopole is proposed.
(b) An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller height,
not to exceed the maximum tower height established by this
section.
(c) On-site location.
[1] A tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the
collocation of an additional antenna may be moved on site
within 50 feet of its existing location, subject to
conformance with setback requirements.
[2] After the tower is rebuilt to accommodate collocation, only
one tower may remain on the site.
(4) Noise standards. Noise attenuation measures shall be included to
reduce noise levels at the facility to a maximum exterior level of 60
decibels. Backup generators may only be operated during power
outages and for testing and maintenance purposes.
G. Collocation.
(1) The Borough of Spring Lake requires that licensed carriers share
personal wireless service facilities and sites where feasible and
appropriate, thereby reducing the number of personal wireless
service facilities that are stand-alone facilities. All applicants for
site plan approval for an individual wireless service facility shall
demonstrate a good faith effort to collocate with other carriers.
Such good faith effort includes:
(a) A survey of all existing structures that may be feasible sites for
collocating personal wireless service facilities;
(b) Notification by certified mail of intent to seek site plan
approval to all the other licensed carriers for commercial
mobile radio services operating in the County; applicant shall
provide proof of notification to the Planning Board; and
(c) Sharing information necessary to determine if collocation is
feasible under the design configuration most accommodating
to collocation.
§ 225-33 SPRING LAKE CODE § 225-33
1:388
(2) In the event that collocation is found to be not technically feasible,
a written statement of the reasons for the infeasibility shall be
submitted to the Borough Clerk and the Planning Board. The
Borough may retain a technical expert in the field of RF
engineering to verify if collocation at the site is not feasible or is
feasible given the design configuration most accommodating to
collocation. The cost for such a technical expert will be at the
expense of the applicant. The Borough may deny approval to an
applicant that has not demonstrated a good faith effort to provide
for collocation.
(3) If the applicant does intend to collocate or to permit collocation,
plans and elevations, which show the ultimate appearance and
operation of the personal wireless service facility at full build-out
shall be submitted.
H. Location priorities. Wireless telecommunication facilities shall be
located and approved in accordance with the following prioritized
locations:

proposed water tower or standpipe owned by the Borough of
Spring Lake or any other public or private utility within or near the
Borough of Spring Lake.
(2) The second priority shall be new towers on lands owned by the
Borough of Spring Lake or other public entity.
(3) The third priority shall be an existing building in the GC Zoning
District.
(4) The fourth priority shall be new towers on lands not owned by the
Borough of Spring Lake or other public entity located within the GC
Zoning District.
I. Site plan submission requirements. In addition to the site plan
submission requirements, the following information shall be submitted
in conjunction with site plan approvals for all wireless
telecommunication facilities:
(1) Comprehensive service plan. In order to provide proper evidence
that any proposed location of wireless telecommunications
antennas (and any supporting tower and/or ancillary building

C. All present Class IV members of the Planning Board shall continue in
office until the completion of the terms for which they were appointed.
The terms of Class IV regular members first appointed pursuant to this
chapter shall be so determined that to the greatest practicable extent
the expiration of such terms shall be evenly distributed over the first
four years after their appointment; provided that the initial term shall

January 1 of the year in which the appointment is made.
E. Alternate members may participate in discussions of the proceedings
but may not vote except in the absence or disqualification of a regular
member of any class. A vote shall not be delayed in order that a regular
member may vote instead of an alternate member. In the event that a
choice must be made as to which alternate member is to vote, Alternate
No. 1 shall vote.
F. If a vacancy of any class shall occur otherwise than by expiration of

which exceed, exclusive of gifts or grants, the amount appropriated by
the governing body for its use.
A. The following Zoning Board of Adjustment powers are vested in the
Planning Board in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-25c:
(1) Error or refusal. Hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the
applicant that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision
or refusal made by a municipal official based on or made in the
enforcement of the zoning provisions of this chapter.
(2) Exceptions or interpretations. Hear and decide requests for
interpretation of the Zoning Map or the zoning provisions of this
chapter or for decisions upon other special questions upon which
the Board is authorized to pass by any zoning provisions of this
chapter or by any duly adopted Official Map.
(3) Granting of variance.
(a) Where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or
shape of a specific piece of property, or by reason of
exceptional topographic conditions or physical features
uniquely affecting a specific piece of property, or by reason of
an extraordinary and exceptional situation uniquely affecting a
specific piece of property or the structures lawfully existing
thereon, the strict application of any zoning regulation of this
chapter would result in peculiar and exceptional practical
difficulties to, or exceptional and undue hardship upon, the
developer of such property, grant, upon an application or an
appeal relating to such property, a variance from such strict
application of such regulation so as to relieve such difficulties
or hardship;
(b) Where in an application or appeal relating to a specific piece of
property the purposes of this chapter would be advanced by a
deviation from the zoning requirements and the benefits of the
deviation would substantially outweigh any detriment, grant a
variance to allow departure from regulations of this chapter;
provided, however, that the fact that a proposed use is an
inherently beneficial use shall not be dispositive of the decision
on the variance under this subsection and provided that no
variance from those departures enumerated in Subsection A(4)
of this section shall be granted under this subsection.
(4) In particular cases for special reasons, grant a variance to allow
departure from any zoning regulations of this chapter:
60.Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
III).
§ 225-35 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 225-36
1:397
(a) A use or principal structure in a district restricted against such
use or principal structure.
(b) An expansion of a nonconforming use.
(c) Deviation from a specification or standard pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-67 pertaining solely to a conditional use.
(d) An increase in the permitted floor area ratio as defined in
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-4.
(e) An increase in the permitted density as defined in N.J.S.A.
40:55D-4, except as applied to the required lot area for a lot or
lots for detached one- or two-dwelling-unit buildings, which lot
or lots either an isolated undersized lot or lots resulting from a
minor subdivision, or
(f) A height of a principal structure which exceeds by 10 feet or
10% the maximum height permitted in the district for a
principal structure.
[1] A variance under this subsection shall be granted only by
affirmative vote of at least five members.
[2] If an application development requests one or more
variances but not a variance for a purpose enumerated in
Subsection D of this section, the decision on the requested
variance or variances shall be rendered under Subsection
C of this section.
(5) General provisions.
(a) No variance or other relief may be granted under the terms of
this section, including a variance or other relief involving an
inherently beneficial use, without a showing that such variance
or other relief can be granted without substantial detriment to
the public good and will not substantially impair the intent and
purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance.
(b) Any variance from the terms of this chapter hereinafter
granted after the effective date of Ordinance No. 2007-009 by
the Planning Board in connection with a final approval
permitting the erection or alteration of any structure or
structures or permitting a specified use of any premises shall
expire by limitation unless such construction or alteration shall
have been actually commenced on each and every structure
permitted by said variance, or unless such permitted use has
actually been commenced, within two years from the entry of
the determination of the Board; except, however, that the
running of the period of limitation herein provided shall be
tolled from the date of filing an appeal from the decision of the
Board in the governing body or to the court of competent
§ 225-36 SPRING LAKE CODE § 225-36
1:398
jurisdiction until the termination in any manner of such appeal
or proceedings. For all variances granted prior to the adoption
of Ordinance No. 2007-009, the duration of the period of
approval and mandatory commencement of the permitted use
shall be extended for an additional 15 months from the date the
variance was granted, for a total of two years from the granting
of the variance to the expiration date. Any construction
commenced within the two-year period provided for in this
section shall be complete within 24 months of the issuance of
the building permit unless otherwise extended in accordance
with the provisions of state statute. However, the running of
the period of limitation shall be tolled from the date of filing
of the appeal from the decision of the Board to the governing
body or to a court of competent jurisdiction, until the
termination in any manner of such appeal of proceeding.
[Amended 4-3-2007 by Ord. No. 2007-009]
(6) The Planning Board shall have such other powers as prescribed by
law, including, but not limited to, the following:
(a) Direct issuance of a construction permit pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-34 for the construction of a building or structure within
the bed of a mapped street or public drainageway, flood control
basin or public area as shown on a duly adopted Official Map of
the municipality wherever one or more parcels of land within
said bed cannot yield a reasonable return to the owner unless a
construction permit is granted. The Board may grant such
relief only by affirmative vote of a majority of the full
authorized membership of the Planning Board, ensuring that
such relief will tend to cause a minimum change of the Official
Map and will not significantly add to the cost of opening any
proposed street. The Board shall impose reasonable
requirements as a condition of granting the construction
permit so as to promote the health, morals, safety and general
welfare of the public.
(b) Direct issuance of a construction permit pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-36 for the construction of a building or structure on a
lot not abutting a street which is shown on a duly adopted
Official Map of the municipality or which is an existing state,
county or municipal street or highway; or a street shown upon
a plat approved by the municipal Planning Board; or a street on
a plat duly filed in the office of the county recording officer. The
Board may grant such relief only when the enforcement of the
statute requirement that a building lot abut a street would
entail practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, or where
the circumstances of the case do not require the building or
structure to abut a street. The Board shall impose
requirements or conditions that will provide adequate access
for fire-fighting equipment, ambulances and other necessary

and that will protect any future street layout on the Official
Map or on the general circulation plan element of the
municipal Master Plan.

(2) Administer the provisions of land subdivision and site plan review
in accordance with the applicable provisions of this chapter.
(3) Participate in the preparation and review of programs or plans

planning process.
(5) Annually, at the request of the Borough Council, prepare a program
of municipal capital improvements projects projected over a term
of six years and recommend same to the Borough Council.
(6) Consider and make report to the Borough Council within 35 days
after referral as to any proposed development regulation submitted
to it and also pass upon other matters specifically referred to the
Planning Board by the Borough Council.
(7) The Planning Board shall have such other powers as prescribed by
law, including, but not limited to, the power to grant the following
variances, to the same extent and subject to the same restrictions
as a Zoning Board of Adjustment, when the Planning Board is
reviewing applications for approval of subdivision plats, site plans
or conditional uses:
(a) Variances pursuant to § 225-36A(3);
(b) Direction pursuant to § 225-36B(7) for issuance of a permit for
a building or structure in the bed of a mapped street or public
drainageway, flood control basin or public area; and
(c) Direction for issuance of a permit for a building or structure on
a lot not abutting a street.
A. Conflicts of interest. No regular or alternate member of the Planning
Board shall act on any matter in which he has either directly or
indirectly any personal or financial interest. Whenever any such
member shall disqualify himself from acting on a particular matter, he
§ 225-36 SPRING LAKE CODE § 225-37
1:400
shall not continue to sit with the Board on the hearing of such matter
nor participate in any discussion or decision relating thereto.

be eligible to vote on a matter upon which the hearing was
conducted, notwithstanding his absence from one or more of the
meetings; provided, however, that such Board member has
available to him the transcript or recording of all of the hearings
from which he was absent, and certifies in writing to the Board that
he has read such transcript or listened to such recording.
(5) All regular meetings and all special meetings shall be open to the
public. Notice of all such meetings shall be given in accordance
with the requirements of the Open Public Meeting Law, c. 231,
Laws of New Jersey, 1975 (N.J.S.A. 10:4-6 et seq.).
C. Public hearings.

such minutes. Such interested party shall be charged a reasonable
fee for the reproduction of the minutes, as indicated in § 225-46 of
this chapter.
(2) A verbatim recording shall be made of every hearing. The

§ 225-38. Appeals and applications to Planning Board.
transcript shall not exceed the maximum amount permitted in
N.J.S.A. 2A:11-15, and as indicated in § 225-46 of this chapter. Each

F. Decisions.
(1) Each decision on any application for development shall be reduced
to writing by the Board and shall include findings of facts and

conclusions either on the date of the meeting at which the Board
grants or denies approval, or, if the meeting at which such action is
taken occurs within the final 45 days of the applicable time period
for rendering a decision on the application for development, within
45 days of such meeting by the adoption of a resolution of
memorialization setting forth the decision and findings and
conclusions of the Board.
(3) Failure of a motion to approve an application for development to
receive the number of votes required for approval shall be deemed
an action denying the application. An action resulting from the

by resolution as provided above, notwithstanding the time at which
such action occurs within the applicable time period for rendering
a decision on the application.
(4) The adoption of a resolution of memorialization pursuant to this
subsection shall not be construed to alter the applicable time
period for rendering a decision on the application for development.
Such resolution shall be adopted by a vote of a majority of the
Board who voted for the action previously taken, and no other
member shall vote thereon. The vote of such a resolution shall be
deemed to be a memorialization of an action taken by the Board,
and not to be an action of the Board; except that failure to adopt
such a resolution within the forty-five-day period shall result in the
approval of the application for development, notwithstanding any
prior action taken thereon.
(5) Whenever a memorialization is adopted, the date of such adoption
shall constitute the date of the decision for purposes of the mailings
and publications specified in § 225-40 of this chapter.
A. Appeals to the Planning Board may be taken by any interested party
affected by any decision of a municipal official of the municipality based
on or made in the enforcement of the zoning provisions of this chapter

days by filing a notice of appeal with the official from whom the appeal
§ 225-37 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 225-38
1:405
§ 225-39. Appeal of decisions to Borough Council.
is taken, with three copies of the notice given to the Clerk of the
Planning Board. The notice shall specify the grounds for the appeal. The
official from whom the appeal is taken shall immediately transmit to
the Board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action
appealed from was taken.
B. The Planning Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may
modify the action, order, requirement, decision, interpretation or
determination appealed from and to that end have all powers of the
municipal official from whom the appeal is taken.
C. An appeal to the Planning Board shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action in respect to which the decision appealed from
was made unless the municipal official from whose action the appeal is
taken certifies to the Planning Board, after the notice of appeal shall
have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate
a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In
such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by an order of the
Superior Court upon notice to the municipal official from whom the
appeal is taken and due cause shown.
D. A developer may file an application for development with the Planning
Board for action under any of its powers without prior application to a
municipal official.
E. The Planning Board shall act upon any appeal or any application for
development within 120 days either from the date the appeal is taken
from the decision of the municipal official or from the date the
application is certified as a complete application by the Borough, as the
case may be, or within such further time as may be consented to by the
applicant, except that when an applicant elects to submit separate
consecutive applications for use variance approval and site plan,
subdivision or conditional use approval, the one-hundred-twenty-day
time period for action shall apply to the application for approval of the
use variance, and the time period for granting or denying and
subsequent approval shall be as otherwise provided in this chapter.
A. Any interested party desiring to appeal a final decision of the Planning
Board approving an application for development pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-70d and § 225-36A(4) of this chapter shall appeal to the
Borough Council.
B. Such appeal shall be made within 10 days of the date of publication of
such final decision pursuant to § 225-40 of this chapter. The appeal to
the Borough Council shall be made by serving the Borough Clerk in
person or by certified mail with a notice of appeal specifying the
grounds thereof and the name and address of the appellant and the
name and address of his attorney, if represented.
§ 225-38 SPRING LAKE CODE § 225-39
1:406
§ 225-40. Notice of decisions.
Any decision of the Planning Board when acting upon an application for
development and any decision of the Borough Council when acting upon an
appeal shall be given notice in the following manner:
C. The appellant shall either: (1) within five days of serving notice of the
appeal, arrange for a transcript for use by the Borough Council and pay
a deposit of $50 or the estimated cost of such transcription, whichever
is less, provided that the charge by the Borough to the applicant for the
transcript shall not exceed the maximum permitted in N.J.S.A.
2A:11-15; or (2) within 35 days of serving notice of the appeal, submit a
transcript to the Borough Clerk for use by the Borough Council. Should
the appellant neither arrange for or submit a transcript as provided
hereinabove, the Borough Council may dismiss the appeal for failure to
prosecute. All transcripts shall be certified in writing by the transcriber
to be accurate.
D. Notice of the meeting to review the record below shall be given by the
Borough Council by personal service or certified mail to the appellant,
to those entitled to notice of a decision pursuant to § 225-40 of this
chapter, and to the Planning Board at least 10 days prior to the date of
the meeting. The appeal shall be decided by the Borough Council only
upon the record established by the Planning Board. The parties may
submit oral and written arguments on the record at the Borough
Council meeting, and the Borough Council shall provide for verbatim
recording and transcripts of such meeting.
E. The Borough Council shall conclude a review of the record below not
later than 95 days from the publication of the notice of the subject
decision of the Planning Board, unless the appellant consents in writing
to an extension of such time period. Failure of the Borough Council to
hold a hearing and conclude a review of the record below and to render
a decision within such specified period without such written consent of
the appellant shall constitute a decision affirming the action of the
Planning Board.
F. The Borough Council may reverse, remand or affirm, wholly or in part,
or may modify the final decision of the Planning Board. The affirmative
vote of a majority of the full authorized membership of the Borough
Council shall be necessary to reverse, remand or modify any final action
of the Board.
G. An appeal to the Borough Council shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action in respect to which the decision appeals from
was made unless the Planning Board certifies to the Borough Council,

developer intends to prepare and submit an application for
development.
(2) The developer shall not be required to submit any fees for such an

A. Preamble.
(1) Whereas, the Municipal Land Use Law requires that every
municipality prepare a Master Plan which is to lay out the longterm
development goals for a municipality which are to be carried
out though the enactment of local land use ordinances; and
(2) Whereas, deviations from these local ordinances by way of
variances pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70c and N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d,
as well as exceptions and waivers pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-51
provide opportunities for significant private gain; and
(3) Whereas, openness in government and a fair and impartial
variance, waiver and exception application process is crucial to
assuring the continuing integrity of the Municipal Master Plan, its
implementing ordinances and the integrity of the variance
application process; and
(4) Whereas, disclosure of political contributions by property owners,
developers and professionals will enhance the Borough's existing
commitment to openness in government and provide further
guaranties for a fair and impartial variance, waiver and exception
application process; and
(5) Whereas, disclosure of political contributions by property owners,
developers and professionals will advance the purposes of the
Municipal Land Use Law to promote morals and the general
welfare;
(6) Now, therefore, be it ordained that the policy of the Borough of
Spring Lake will be to enhance the Borough's commitment to
openness in government, by providing further guaranties for a fair
and impartial variance, waiver and exception application process,
and in promoting morals and the general welfare through the
§ 225-41 SPRING LAKE CODE § 225-42
1:410
integrity of the municipal planning process by requiring the
supplementation of the municipal application checklist to include
a contribution disclosure statement listing any specified political
contributions made by property owners, developers and the
professionals whose services they use in applications for major
variances, waivers and exceptions, pursuant to N.J.S.A.

in obtaining legally required approvals from other governmental
entities and that the developer or applicant applied promptly for
and diligently pursued the approvals. [Added 8-26-2003 by Ord.

by the Board or, where the remaining portion of the original tract
is of sufficient size to be subdivided or developed further, the
applicant may be required to submit a sketch of the entire
remaining portion of the tract to indicate a feasible plan whereby
the applied for subdivision or development, together with
subsequent subdivision(s) or development(s), may be submitted
that will not create, impose or aggravate or lead to any such
adverse effect.
(6) All hearings held on applications for preliminary major subdivision
approval (and in certain cases preliminary major site plan

set the date, time and place for the public hearing and shall inform
the applicant of this at least 14 days prior to said hearing date.
Notice of the hearing shall be given by the applicant at least 10
days prior to the date of the hearing. (See § 225-37D.)

plan. If the Board acts favorably on the preliminary plat or plan, the
Chairman and Secretary of the Board (or the Acting Chairman or
Secretary, where either or both may be absent) shall affix their
signatures to at least five copies of the plat or plan with the
notification that it has been approved.
(8) Should minor revisions or additions to the plat or plan be deemed
necessary, the Board may grant preliminary approval subject to
specified conditions and receipt of revised plans within 30 days
from the date of said approval. Should major revisions be deemed
necessary, the Board shall require that an amended plan be
submitted and acted upon as in the case of the original application
for preliminary approval.
(9) If the Board, after consideration and discussion of the preliminary
plat or plan, determines that it is unacceptable, a notation shall be
made by the Chairman of the Board to that effect on the plat or plan
and a resolution adopted setting forth the reasons for such
rejection. One copy of the plat or plan and said resolution shall be
returned to the applicant within 10 days of such determination.

E. Expiration of approval. Unless the preliminary approval of a subdivision
or site plan is extended as provided in Subsection D(3) above, the
approval shall be deemed to lapse and shall be of no further effect after
three years from the date of preliminary approval. In which case, the
developer or applicant shall not be entitled to apply for final approval
based on the granted terms and conditions of the preliminary approval.
If the preliminary approval is extended and the applicant fails to apply
for final approval within the extension period, then the preliminary
approval shall be deemed to lapse and be of no further effect at the

jurisdiction in the area, approving each proposed utility
installation and design and stating who will construct the
facility so that service will be available prior to occupancy.
The designing engineer(s) shall certify to the Board that the
existing cross section(s) and profile(s) have been run in the
field and the field notes shall be forwarded to the Borough
Engineer. The applicant shall certify in writing to the Board
that he has:

at the direction of the Planning Board, the Administrative Officer
either shall notify the applicant in writing that the application has
been determined to be incomplete or shall certify that the
submission is a complete application. If the application is
determined to be incomplete, the reasons for such determination
shall be specified to the applicant and an appropriately revised plan
may thereafter be submitted to the Administrative Officer as in the
first instance. If the Administrative Officer neither certifies to the
applicant that the application is complete nor notices the applicant
in writing that the application has been determined to be
incomplete, then the application shall be considered certified
complete and the period for action by the Board shall commence.
(2) The Planning Board shall take action on a final major site plan and/
or subdivision application within 45 days after the application has
been certified complete by the Administrative Officer or within
such further time as may be consented to by the applicant. Failure
of the Board to act within the prescribed time period shall
constitute approval of the application.
(3) If the Board acts favorably on the final submission, the Chairman
and the Secretary of the Board (or the Acting Chairman and
Secretary where either or both may be absent) shall affix their
signatures to at least five copies of the plat or plan with a notation
that it has been approved. The applicant shall furnish such copies
§ 225-45 SPRING LAKE CODE § 225-45
1:424
to the Board for signing. In the case of final subdivisions only, the
applicant shall include two Mylar copies of the approved lot.
(4) After approval of the final plat or plan by the Board, copies of the
signed plat or plan shall be furnished by the Administrative Officer
to each of the following within 10 days from the date of such
approval:
(a) Board files (Mylar if applicable);
(b) Construction Official and Zoning Officer;
(c) Borough Tax Assessor;
(d) The applicant (Mylar if applicable); and
(e) Such other municipal, county or state agencies or official as
directed by the Board.
(5) Within 95 days of the date of approval by the Board of a final
subdivision plat, the subdivider shall file a copy of same with the
County Clerk. In the event of failure to file within said 95 days, the
approval of the minor subdivision shall expire and any further
proceedings shall require the filing of a new sketch plat as in the
first instance. The Board, for good cause shown, may extend the
time for filing for an additional 95 days.
(6) If the Board, after consideration and discussion of the final
submission, determines that it is unacceptable, a notation shall be
made by the Chairman of the Board to that effect on the plat or plan
and a resolution adopted setting forth the reasons for such
rejection. One copy of the plat or plan and the resolution shall be
returned to the applicant within 10 days of such determination.
D. Effect of final approval. Final approval of a subdivision or site plan shall
confer upon the applicant the following rights for a two-year period
from the date of final approval:
(1) The zoning requirements applicable to the final approval first
granted and all other rights conferred upon the developer, whether
conditionally or otherwise, shall not be changed.
(2) If the developer has followed the standards prescribed for final
approval, the Board may extend the period of protection for
extensions of one year each, not exceeding three such extensions.
E. Expiration of approval. Unless the final approval of a subdivision or site
plan is extended as provided in Subsection D(2) above, the approval
shall be deemed to lapse and shall be of no further effect after two years
from the date of final approval. If the final approval is extended and the
applicant fails to apply for a building permit within the extension
period, then the approval shall be deemed to lapse and be of no further
effect at the expiration of the extension period.

independent study or report regarding the impact of the applicant's
proposed development and/or recommend appropriate treatments. Said
escrow fees shall be segregated for each applicant so that the fee that is
paid shall be utilized only for that particular application. In the event
that any of the escrows remain unused at the conclusion of the

development to the Planning Board requires more than two
professional reviews by the Board's staff and consultants and/or more
than two caucus meetings, if applicable, and/or more than two public
hearings, subsequent to the initial filing of such application and prior to
the final determination on such application, the applicant shall be
required to pay an additional fee in the amount representing 25% of the

improvements as estimated by the Borough Engineer, and assuring
the installation of said improvements as agreed and provided for in
this chapter.
(2) A performance guaranty estimate shall be prepared by the

improvements as fixed by the Board and their estimated cost.
[Amended 2-12-2001 by Ord. No. 4-2001]
B. Approval by Borough Attorney.

of credit, certified check or a performance bond in which the owner
§ 225-46 SPRING LAKE CODE § 225-47
1:428
shall be principal, the bond to be provided by an acceptable surety
company licensed to do business in the State of New Jersey. The
Borough shall issue its receipt for such deposits and shall cause the

1:429
(i) Monuments.

(4) Inspection by the Borough of the installation of improvements and
utilities shall not operate to subject the Borough of Spring Lake to
liability for claims, suits or liability of any kind that at any time may
arise because of defects or negligence during construction or at
any time thereafter; it being recognized that the responsibility to
maintain safe conditions at all times during construction and to
provide proper utilities and improvements is upon the owner and
his contractors, if any.
(5) Upon the completion or substantial completion of all required
improvements, the obligor may notify the Borough Council in
writing, by certified mail in care of the Borough Clerk, of the
completion or substantial completion of the improvements and

contents of the Engineer's report and action of the Borough Council,
not later than 65 days after the receipt of the notice of the obligor of the
completion or substantial completion of the improvements. Failure of
the Borough Council to send or provide such notification to the obligor
within the 65 days shall be deemed to constitute approval of the
improvements and the obligor and surety, if any, shall be released from
all liability pursuant to the performance guaranty for such
improvements.
(1) Where partial approval is granted, the obligor shall be released
from all liability pursuant to the performance guaranty for such
improvements, except for the portion adequately sufficient to
secure provision of the improvements not yet approved, provided
that 30% of the performance guaranty posted may be retained to
insure the completion of all improvements and that said 30% may
be applied against all improvements, regardless of when
completed.
(2) If any portion of the required improvements is rejected, the obligor
shall complete such improvements and, upon completion, shall
notify the Borough Council as specified in Subsection D(5) of this
§ 225-47 SPRING LAKE CODE § 225-47
1:430
section and the same procedures shall be followed as in the first
instance.
F. Conditions and acceptance of improvements. The approval of any
application for development by the Borough shall in no way be
construed as acceptance of any street or drainage system, or any other
improvement nor shall such approval obligate the Borough in any way
to exercise jurisdiction over any such street or drainage system or other
improvement. No improvement shall be accepted by the governing body
unless and until all of the following conditions have been met:
(1) The Borough Engineer shall have certified in writing that the
improvements are completed and that they comply with the
requirements of this chapter;
(2) Any relevant application for development shall have been approved
by the appropriate Board;

run for a period of two years. The procedures and requirements
governing such maintenance guaranty shall be identical with the
procedures and requirements for a performance guaranty set forth
in this chapter. The requirements for a maintenance guaranty may
be waived by the Borough Council only if the Borough Engineer has
certified that the improvements have been in continuous use for not
less than two years from the date the Borough Engineer certified
completion of such improvements and that during this period the
owner has maintained the improvements in a satisfactory manner;
and
(4) An as-built plan and profiles of all utilities and roads (three blackand-
white prints plus a Mylar copy to be sent to the Borough
Engineer) have been given to the Borough with certification signed
and sealed by a New Jersey licensed professional engineer as to the
actual construction as approved by the Borough Engineer.

Development Fees
[Added 12-7-1998 by Ord. No. 25-1998; amended 4-18-2005 by Ord.
No. 11-2005; 8-8-06 by Ord. No. 13-2006; 11-10-2009 by Ord. No.
2009-007]
§ 225-48. Short title.
This Article shall be known and may be cited as the "Development Fee
Ordinance of Spring Lake Borough."
§ 225-49. Purpose.
§ 225-50. Residential development fees.
A. In Holmdel Builder's Association V. Holmdel Township, 121 N.J. 550
(1990), the New Jersey Supreme Court determined that mandatory
development fees are authorized by the Fair Housing Act of 1985 (the
Act), N.J.S.A. 52:27d-301 et seq., and the State Constitution, subject to
the Council on Affordable Housing's (COAH's) adoption of rules.
B. Pursuant to PL 2008, c.46 section 8 (52:27D-329.2) and the Statewide
Non- Residential Development Fee Act, the Superior Court is
authorized to adopt and promulgate regulations necessary for the
establishment, implementing, review, monitoring and enforcement of
municipal affordable housing trust funds and corresponding spending
plans. [Amended 4-23-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-08]
C. This article establishes standards for the collection, maintenance, and
expenditure of development fees pursuant to COAH's regulations and in
accordance P.L.2008, c.46, Sections 8 and 32-38. Fees collected
pursuant to this article shall be used for the sole purpose of providing
low- and moderate-income housing. This article shall be interpreted
within the framework of COAH's rules on development fees, codified at
N.J.A.C. 5:97-8.
A. Imposed fees.
(1) Within any zoning district permitting residential development,
residential developers, except for developers of the types of
development specifically exempted below, shall pay a fee of 1.5% of
the equalized assessed value for residential development provided
no increased density is permitted.
(2) When an increase in residential density pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-70d(5) (known as a "d" variance) has been permitted,
developers shall be required to pay a development fee of 6% of the
equalized assessed value for each additional unit permitted under
such d variance. However, if the zoning on a site has changed
during the two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance
application, the base density for the purposes of calculating the
§ 225-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 225-50
1:433
§ 225-51. Nonresidential development fees.
bonus development fee shall be the highest density permitted by
right during the two-year period preceding the filing of the
variance application.
Example: If an approval allows four units to be constructed on a
site that was zoned for two units, the fees could equal 1 1/2% of the
equalized assessed value on the first two units; and the specified
higher percentage up to 6% of the equalized assessed value for the
two additional units, provided zoning on the site has not changed
during the two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance
application.
B. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for residential
development.
(1) Affordable housing developments and developments where the
developer has made a payment in lieu of on-site construction of
affordable units shall be exempt from development fees.
(2) Developments that have received preliminary or final site plan
approval prior to the adoption of a municipal development fee
ordinance shall be exempt from development fees, unless the
developer seeks a substantial change in the approval. Where a site
plan approval does not apply, a zoning and/or building permit shall
be synonymous with preliminary or final site plan approval for this
purpose. The fee percentage shall be vested on the date that the
building permit is issued.
(3) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing
structure undergoes a change to a more intense use, is demolished
and replaced, or is expanded, if the expansion is not otherwise
exempt from the development fee requirement. The development
fee shall be calculated on the increase in the equalized assessed
value of the improved structure.
(4) Developers of affordable housing projects shall be exempt from
paying a development fee.
A. Imposed fees.
(1) Within all zoning districts, nonresidential developers, except for
developers of the types of development specifically exempted, shall
pay a fee equal to 2.5% of the equalized assessed value of the land
and improvements, for all new nonresidential construction on an
unimproved lot or lots.
(2) Nonresidential developers, except for developers of the types of
development specifically exempted, shall also pay a fee equal to
2.5% of the increase in equalized assessed value resulting from any
§ 225-50 SPRING LAKE CODE § 225-51
1:434
§ 225-52. Collection of fees.
additions to existing structures to be used for nonresidential
purposes.
(3) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing
structure is demolished and replaced. The development fee of 2.5%
shall be calculated on the difference between the equalized
assessed value of the pre-existing land and improvement and the
equalized assessed value of the newly improved structure, i.e. land
and improvement, at the time final certificate of occupancy is
issued. If the calculation required under this section results in a
negative number, the nonresidential development fee shall be zero.
B. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for
nonresidential development.
(1) The nonresidential portion of a mixed-use inclusionary or market
rate development shall be subject to the 2.5% development fee,
unless otherwise exempted below.
(2) The 2.5% fee shall not apply to an increase in equalized assessed
value resulting from alterations, change in use within existing
footprint, reconstruction, renovations and repairs.
(3) Nonresidential developments shall be exempt from the payment of
non-residential development fees in accordance with the
exemptions required pursuant to P.L.2008, c.46, as specified in the
Form N-RDF "State of New Jersey Non-Residential Development
Certification/Exemption" Form. Any exemption claimed by a
developer shall be substantiated by that developer.

Council.
LANDLORD — The person or persons who own or purport to own any

or dwelling under either a written or oral lease, including but not limited
to any building subject to the Hotel and Multiple Dwelling Law, P.L. 1967,
c. 76 (N.J.S.A. 55:13A-1 et seq.), and owner-occupied two-unit premises. In

A. Spring Lake is a residential community and its citizens have
experienced disturbances, damage and public expense resulting from
carelessly granted and inadequately supervised seasonal rentals to
irresponsible vacationers by inept or indifferent landlords.
B. This article is enacted to preserve the peace and tranquility of the
community for its permanent residents, and to maintain the
municipality as a viable vacation resort for all persons and families
availing themselves of the facilities in the community.
C. The enactment of this article is necessary and desirable to provide a
means to curb and discourage those occasional excesses arising from
irresponsible seasonal rentals.
D. The Legislature of the State of New Jersey enacted N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.12n
et seq. to enable certain communities to take effective action to assure
that excesses, when they occur, shall not be repeated, and that
landlords offering seasonal rentals be held to sufficient standards of
responsibility.
§ 292-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 292-10
1:503
and conviction in any court of competent jurisdiction of disorderly persons
or Borough ordinances.
§ 292-11. Hearing; penalty.
A. If in any twelve-month period, two complaints on separate occasions of
disorderly, indecent, tumultuous, noise or riotous conduct upon or in
any seasonal rental premises, and attributable to the acts or
incitements of any of the tenants of those premises, have been
substantiated by prosecution and conviction in any court of competent
jurisdiction, the Mayor and Council or any officer or employee of the
Borough of Spring Lake, so designated by the Mayor and Council for
this purpose, may institute proceedings to require the landlord of the
seasonal rental premises to post a bond against the consequences of
future incidents of the same character.
B. The Mayor and Council or any officer or employee of the municipality
designated by the Mayor and Council shall cause to be served upon the
landlord, in person or by registered mail, to the address appearing on
the tax records of the municipality, notice advising of the institution of
such proceedings, together with particulars of the substantiated
complaint upon which those proceedings are based, and of the time and
place at which the hearing will be held on the matter, which shall be in
the Municipal Building, Municipal Court or such other public place as
designated by the Mayor and Council, and which shall be no sooner
than 30 days from the date upon which the notice is served or mailed.
C. At the hearing convened pursuant to Subsection B above, the hearing
officer shall give full hearing to both the complaint of the municipality
and to any evidence in contradiction or mitigation that the landlord, if
present or represented and offering such evidence, may present. At the
conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall determine whether
the landlord shall be required to post a bond in accordance with the
terms of this article.
D. Any bond required to be posted shall be in accordance with the
judgment of the hearing officer, in light of the nature and extent of the
offenses indicated in the substantiated complaints upon which the
proceedings are based, to be adequate in the case of subsequent
offenses to reparation for:
(1) Damages likely to be caused to public or private property and
damages consequent upon disruption of affected residents' rights
of fair use and quiet enjoyment of their premises; and
(2) Securing the payment of fines and penalties likely to be levied for
such offenses; and
(3) Compensating the municipality for the costs of repressing and
prosecuting such incidents of disorderly behavior; provided,
however, that no such bond shall be in an amount less than $500
§ 292-10 SPRING LAKE CODE § 292-11
1:504
§ 292-12. Bond forfeiture; extension.
nor more than $5,000. The municipality may enforce a bond thus
required by action in the Superior Court, and shall be entitled to an
injunction prohibiting the landlord from making or renewing any
lease of the affected premises for residential purposes until that
bond or equivalent security, in satisfactory form and amount, has
been deposited with the municipality.
E. Any bond or other security deposited in compliance with Subsection D
above shall remain in force for a period of four years. Upon the lapse of
the four-year period, the landlord shall be entitled to the discharge of
the bonds, unless prior thereto further proceedings leading to a
forfeiture or partial forfeiture of the bond or other security shall have
been had under § 292-12 below, in which case the security shall be
renewed in an amount and for a period that shall be specified by the
hearing officer. A transfer of ownership or control of the property shall
not void a requirement for security imposed under this article. The
person or persons to whom ownership or control is transferred shall
maintain that security, and shall be subject to injunctive proceedings as
authorized by Subsection D above in the same manner as the landlord
upon which the requirement was originally imposed; provided,
however, that the Mayor and Council may by resolution shorten the
period for which security is required to not less than one year from the
date of the transfer of ownership or control, if during that year no
substantiated complaints are recorded with respect to the property in
question.
A. If during the period for which a landlord is required to give security
pursuant to § 292-11 above, a substantiated complaint is recorded
against the property in question, the Mayor and Council or its designee
may institute proceedings against the landlord for the forfeiture or
partial forfeiture of the security, for an extension as provided in
§ 292-11E above, of the period for which the security is required, or for
increase in the amount of security required, or for any or all of those
purposes.
B. Any forfeiture or partial forfeiture of security shall be determined by
the hearing officer solely in accordance with the amount deemed
necessary to provide for the compensatory purposes set forth in
§ 292-11D above. Any decision by the hearing officer to increase the
amount or extend the period of the required security shall be
determined in light of the same factors set forth in § 292-11D above,
and shall be taken only to the extent that the nature of the
substantiated complaint or complaints out of which proceedings arise
under this article indicates the appropriateness of such change in order
to effectually carry out the purposes of this article. The decision of the
hearing officer in such circumstances shall be enforceable in the same
manner as provided in § 292-11D above.
§ 292-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 292-13

§ 292-13. Hearing officer; qualifications.

subject to the advice and consent of the Mayor and Council. A hearing
officer shall not own or lease any real property within the Borough of Spring
Lake, nor hold any interest in the assets of or profits arising from the
ownership or lease of such property.

Title; Scope and Purpose
§ 321-1. Title. [Amended 2-12-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-002]
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as "Stormwater Control."
§ 321-2. Scope and purpose.
A. Policy statement. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant
reduction through nonstructural or low-impact techniques shall be
explored before relying on structural BMPs. Structural BMPs should be
integrated with nonstructural stormwater management strategies and
proper maintenance plans. Nonstructural strategies include both
environmentally sensitive site design and source controls that prevent
pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed to
stormwater. Source control plans should be developed based upon
physical site conditions and the origin, nature, and the anticipated
quantity or amount of potential pollutants. Multiple stormwater
management BMPs may be necessary to achieve the established
performance standards for water quality, quantity, and groundwater
recharge.
B. Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for major
development, as defined in § 321-4.

Standards and Requirements.
§ 321-5. Design and performance standards for stormwater
management measures.
§ 321-6. Requirements for major development.
A. Stormwater management measures for major development shall be
developed to meet the erosion control, groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality standards in
§ 321-6. To the maximum extent practicable, these standards shall be
met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater management strategies
into the design. If these strategies alone are not sufficient to meet these
standards, structural stormwater management measures necessary to
meet these standards shall be incorporated into the design.
B. The standards in this chapter apply only to new major development and
are intended to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on water
quality and water quantity in receiving water bodies and maintain
groundwater recharge. The standards do not apply to new major
development to the extent that alternative design and performance
standards are applicable under a regional stormwater management
plan or water quality management plan adopted in accordance with
Department rules.
A. The development shall incorporate a maintenance plan for the
stormwater management measures incorporated into the design of a
major development in accordance with § 321-12.
B. Stormwater management measures shall avoid adverse impacts of
concentrated flow on habitat for threatened and endangered species as
documented in the Department's Landscape Project or Natural
Heritage Database established under N.J.S.A. 13:1B-5.147 through
5.50.
C. The following linear development projects are exempt from the
groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater
runoff quality requirements of Subsections F and G:
(1) The construction of an underground utility line, provided that the
disturbed areas are revegetated upon completion;
(2) The construction of an aboveground utility line, provided that the
existing conditions are maintained to the maximum extent
practicable; and
(3) The construction of a public pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk
or trail with a maximum width of 14 feet, provided that the access
is made of permeable material.

1:547
D. A waiver from strict compliance from the groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
requirements of Subsections F and G may be obtained for the
enlargement of an existing public roadway; or the construction or
enlargement of a public pedestrian access, provided that the following
conditions are met:
(1) The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the
project that cannot be accomplished by any other means;
(2) The applicant demonstrates, through an alternatives analysis, that
through the use of nonstructural and structural stormwater
management strategies and measures, the option selected
complies with the requirements of Subsections F and G to the
maximum extent practicable;
(3) The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the requirements
of Subsections F and G, existing structures currently in use, such
as homes and buildings, would need to be condemned; and
(4) The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other
rights to areas, including the potential to obtain through
condemnation lands not falling under Subsection D(3) above within
the upstream drainage area of the receiving stream, that would
provide additional opportunities to mitigate the requirements of
Subsections F and G that were not achievable on-site.
E. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in Subsections F
and G shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies set forth in this subsection into the design.
The applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures
incorporated into the design of the project. If the applicant
contends that it is not feasible for engineering, environmental, or
safety reasons to incorporate any nonstructural stormwater
management measures identified in Subsection E(2) into the design
of a particular project, the applicant shall identify the strategy
considered and provide a basis for the contention.
(2) Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated
into site design shall:
(a) Protect areas that provide water quality benefits or areas
particularly susceptible to erosion and sediment loss;
(b) Minimize impervious surfaces and break up or disconnect the
flow of runoff over impervious surfaces;
(c) Maximize the protection of natural drainage features and
vegetation;

[a] A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches
wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inch.
[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars, to
the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified
in Subsection G(1); or
[4] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register listed historic property.
§ 321-6 SPRING LAKE CODE § 321-6

(4) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in Subsections F and
G shall be dedicated to a government agency, subjected to a
conservation restriction filed with the Office of the Monmouth
County Clerk, or subject to an approved equivalent restriction that
ensures that measure or an equivalent stormwater management
measure approved by the Borough Engineer is maintained in
perpetuity.
(5) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in Section 321-9, or found on the Department's
Web site at www.njstormwater.org.
F. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq. and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at § 321-7, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain 100% of the average annual
preconstruction groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from preconstruction to postconstruction for the twoyear
storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the "urban redevelopment area," or to
projects subject to Subsection F(1)(b)[3] below.
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
§ 321-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 321-6
1:551
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or
applied, areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than "reportable
quantities" as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with a Department-approved remedial action work
plan or landfill closure plan and areas with high risks
for spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
"Source material" means any material(s) or
machinery, located at an industrial facility, that is
directly or indirectly related to process,
manufacturing or other industrial activities, which
could be a source of pollutants in any industrial
stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source
materials include, but are not limited to, raw
materials; intermediate products; final products;
waste materials; byproducts; industrial machinery and
fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents that are
related to process, manufacturing, or other industrial
activities that are exposed to stormwater.
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
down gradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 321-7, complete one of the
following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, postconstruction
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten-, and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the
§ 321-6 SPRING LAKE CODE § 321-6
1:552
preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten-, and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
and projected land uses assuming full development under
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage
area;
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
postconstruction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten- and
one-hundred year storm events are 50%, 75% and 80%,
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the postconstruction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
site on which the proposed development or project is to be
constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to
postconstruction stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge.
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of major development at § 321-4 shall be submitted to the
Freehold Soils Conservation District (FSCD) for review and
approval in accordance with the requirements of this section and
any applicable FSCD guidelines for stormwater runoff quantity and
erosion control.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
postconstruction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater
runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the developed site,
expressed as an annual average. Stormwater management
measures shall only be required for water quality control if an
additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being proposed on a
development site. The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to
any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric
effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in
a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this
requirement. The water quality design storm is 1.25 inches of
rainfall in two hours. Water quality calculations shall take into
account the distribution of rain from the water quality design
storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation of the volume of
runoff may take into account the implementation of nonstructural
and structural stormwater management measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 321-9 or found on the Department's Web site
at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other sources of
technical guidance are listed in § 321-9. TSS reduction shall be
calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2
below. Alternative removal rates and methods of calculating
§ 321-6 SPRING LAKE CODE § 321-6
1:554
removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides
documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative
rates and methods to the review agency.
(3) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
eighty-percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize
the following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A + B - (AB)/100
Where
R = total TSS percent load removal from application of both
BMPs
A = TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP
B = TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second BMP
Table 2: TSS Removal Rates for BMPs
Best Management Practice
Rate
TSS Percent Removal
(percent)
Bioretention systems 90%
Constructed stormwater wetland 90%
Extended detention basin 40% to 60%
Infiltration structure 80%
Manufactured treatment device See § 321-8C
Sand filter 80%
Vegetative filter strip 60% to 80%
Wet pond 50% to 90%
(4) If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the eighty-percent
TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the
runoff from the subareas converge on site, in which case the
removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a
weighted average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the postconstruction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in Subsections F and G.
(6) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff rate to waters classified as FW1.
§ 321-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 321-6
1:555
(7) Special water resource protection areas have been established
along all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and
perennial or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the
Category One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or
in the County Soil Surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage
area. These areas have been established for the protection of water
quality, aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance,
exceptional recreational significance, exceptional water supply
significance, and exceptional fisheries significance of those
established Category One waters. These areas shall be designated
and protected as follows:
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A three-hundred-foot special water resource protection
area shall be provided on each side of the waterway,
measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of
the bank outwards or from the center line of the waterway
where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing
vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural
succession.
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under Subsection G(7)(a)[1]
above shall only be allowed where previous development
or disturbance has occurred (for example, active
agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn area).
The encroachment shall only be allowed where applicant
demonstrates that the functional value and overall
condition of the special water resource protection area will
be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no
case shall the remaining special water resource protection
area be reduced to less than 50 feet as measured
perpendicular to the top of bank of the waterway or center
line of the waterway where the bank is undefined. All
encroachments proposed under this subsection shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(b) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the Standard for Off-Site Stability in the "Standards for
Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey," established
under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A.
4:24-39 et seq.
(c) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
Standard for Off-Site Stability in the "Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey," established
§ 321-6 SPRING LAKE CODE § 321-6
1:556
§ 321-7. Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater
recharge.
under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A.
4:24-39 et seq., then the stabilization measures in accordance
with the requirements of the above standards may be placed
within the special water resource protection area, provided
that:
[1] Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 50 feet of
the Category One waterway;
[2] Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
section shall achieve a ninety-five-percent TSS
postconstruction removal rate;
[3] Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
[4] The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable;
[5] A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate Department staff and Soil Conservation
District staff to identify necessary stabilization measures;
and
[6] All encroachments proposed under this section shall be
reviewed and approved by the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection prior to approval by the review
agency.
(d) Subsection G(7) does not apply to the construction of one
individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Section 4 — Hydrology and
Technical Release 55 — Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds; or
§ 321-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 321-7
1:557
(b) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition
of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at Subsection A(1)(a) and the Rational and
Modified Rational Methods at Subsection A(1)(b). A runoff
coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing
condition may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design
engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has existed on the
site or portion of the site for at least five years without interruption
prior to the time of application. If more than one land cover has
existed on the site during the five years immediately prior to the
time of application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential
shall be used for the computations. In addition, there is the
presumption that the site is in good hydrologic condition (if the
land use type is pasture, lawn, or park), with good cover (if the land
use type is woods), or with good hydrologic condition and
conservation treatment (if the land use type is cultivation).
(3) In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or
culverts, that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55 — Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds and other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater
management measures.
B. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
following:
(1) The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32 A Method for
Evaluating Ground-Water Recharge Areas in New Jersey,
incorporated herein by reference as amended and supplemented.

C. Designs of stormwater conduit systems shall utilize the Sandy Hook,
twenty-five-year, rainfall.
A. Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as
follows:
(1) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
take into account the existing site conditions, including, for
example, environmentally critical areas, wetlands; flood-prone
areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high water table; soil type,
permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage patterns; and
the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone).
(2) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and
ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the
intake to the outlet structure as appropriate, and shall have parallel
bars with one-inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of the
water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the water
quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure shall
be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the diameter of the
orifice or 1/3 the width of the weir, with a minimum spacing
between bars of one inch and a maximum spacing between bars of
six inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must comply with
the requirements of § 321-10B.
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosionresistant.
Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions
of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3,
7.4, and 7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
(4) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin,
the orifice size shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 inches in diameter.
(5) Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins at
§ 321-10.
B. Stormwater management measure guidelines are available in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. Other
stormwater management measures may be utilized, provided the
design engineer demonstrates that the proposed measure and its
design will accomplish the required water quantity, groundwater

1:560
A. This section sets forth requirements to protect public safety through
the proper design and operation of stormwater management basins.
This section applies to any new stormwater management basin. The
provisions of this section are not intended to preempt more stringent
municipal or county safety requirements for new or existing stormwater
management basins. Spring Lake Borough and Monmouth County
stormwater management plans and ordinances may, pursuant to their
authority, require existing stormwater management basins to be
retrofitted to meet one or more of the safety standards in Subsection
B(1), (2) and (3) for trash racks, overflow grates, and escape provisions
at outlet structures.
B. Requirements for trash racks, overflow grates and escape provisions.
(1) A trash rack is a device designed to catch trash and debris and
prevent the clogging of outlet structures. Trash racks shall be
installed at the intake to the outlet from the stormwater
management basin to ensure proper functioning of the basin
outlets in accordance with the following:
(a) The trash rack shall have parallel bars, with no greater than
six-inch spacing between the bars.
(b) The trash rack shall be designed so as not to adversely affect
the hydraulic performance of the outlet pipe or structure.
(c) The average velocity of flow through a clean trash rack is not to
exceed 2.5 feet per second under the full range of stage and
discharge. Velocity is to be computed on the basis of the net
area of opening through the rack.
(d) The trash rack shall be constructed and installed to be rigid,
durable, and corrosion-resistant, and shall be designed to
withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300 pounds per
square foot.
(2) An overflow grate is designed to prevent obstruction of the
overflow structure. If an outlet structure has an overflow grate,
such grate shall meet the following requirements:
(a) The overflow grate shall be secured to the outlet structure but
be removable for emergencies and maintenance.
(b) The overflow grate spacing shall be no less than two inches
across the smallest dimension.
(c) The overflow grate shall be constructed and installed to be
rigid, durable, and corrosion-resistant, and shall be designed
to withstand a perpendicular live loading of 300 pounds per
square foot.
(3) For purposes of this Subsection B(3), "escape provisions" means
the permanent installation of ladders, steps, rungs, or other
§ 321-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 321-10
1:561
§ 321-11. Site development stormwater plan requirements.
features that provide easily accessible means of egress from
stormwater management basins. Stormwater management basins
shall include escape provisions as follows:
(a) If a stormwater management basin has an outlet structure,
escape provisions shall be incorporated in or on the structure.
With the prior approval of the reviewing agency identified in
Subsection C, a freestanding outlet structure may be exempted
from this requirement.
(b) Safety ledges shall be constructed on the slopes of all new
stormwater management basins having a permanent pool of
water deeper than 2 1/2 feet. Such safety ledges shall be
comprised of two steps. Each step shall be four feet to six feet
in width. One step shall be located approximately 2 1/2 feet
below the permanent water surface, and the second step shall
be located one foot to 1 1/2 feet above the permanent water
surface. See Subsection D for an illustration of safety ledges in
a stormwater management basin.
(c) In new stormwater management basins, the maximum interior
slope for an earthen dam, embankment, or berm shall not be
steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.
C. Variance or exemption from safety standards. A variance or exemption
from the safety standards for stormwater management basins may be
granted only upon a written finding by the appropriate reviewing
agency, the Borough of Spring Lake, the County of Monmouth or the
Department that the variance or exemption will not constitute a threat
to public safety.

calculations for the predevelopment and postdevelopment
conditions for the design storms specified in § 321-6.
[2] When the proposed stormwater management control
measures (e.g., infiltration basins) depend on the
hydrologic properties of soils, then a soils report shall be
submitted. The soils report shall be based on on-site
boring logs or soil pit profiles. The number and location of
required soil borings or soil pits shall be determined based
on what is needed to determine the suitability and
distribution of soils present at the location of the control
measure.

§ 321-12. Maintenance and repair.
(g) Maintenance and repair plan. The design and planning of the
stormwater management facility shall meet the maintenance
requirements of § 321-12.
(2) Waiver from submission requirements. The Borough Engineer or, if
applicable, Board Engineer in consultation with the Borough
Engineer may waive submission of any of the requirements in
Subsection C(1)(a) through (f) when it can be demonstrated that
the information requested is impossible to obtain or it would create
a hardship on the applicant to obtain and its absence will not
materially affect the review process.
A. Applicability. Projects subject to review as in § 321-3 shall comply with
the requirements of Subsections B and C.
B. General maintenance.
(1) The design engineer shall prepare a maintenance plan for the
stormwater management measures incorporated into the design of
a major development.
(2) The maintenance plan shall contain specific preventative
maintenance tasks and schedules; cost estimates, including
estimated cost of sediment, debris, or trash removal; and the name,
address, and telephone number of the person or persons
responsible for preventative and corrective maintenance (including
replacement). Maintenance guidelines for stormwater
management measures are available in the New Jersey Stormwater
Best Management Practices Manual. If the maintenance plan
identifies a person other than the developer (for example, a public
agency or homeowners' association) as having the responsibility for
maintenance, the plan shall include documentation of such
person's agreement to assume this responsibility, or of the
developer's obligation to dedicate a stormwater management
facility to such person under an applicable ordinance or regulation.
(3) If the responsibility for maintenance is not assigned or transferred
to the Borough in a residential development or project, or if the
responsibility for facilities located in commercial or industrial
development sites is by the owner of the site, a named individual
shall be responsible for the safety and maintenance of said facility,
and a posting of a two-year maintenance guarantee in accordance
with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53 shall be required for all facilities not
dedicated to the Borough or other public agency.
(4) If the person responsible for maintenance identified under
Subsection B(2) above is not a public agency, the maintenance plan
and any future revisions based on Subsection B(7) below shall be
recorded upon the deed of record for each property on which the
§ 321-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 321-12
1:565
maintenance described in the maintenance plan must be
undertaken.
(5) Preventative and corrective maintenance shall be performed to
maintain the function of the stormwater management measure,
including repairs or replacement to the structure; removal of
sediment, debris, or trash; restoration of eroded areas; snow and
ice removal; fence repair or replacement; restoration of vegetation;
and repair or replacement of nonvegetated linings.
(6) The person responsible for maintenance identified under
Subsection B(2) above shall maintain a detailed log of all
preventative and corrective maintenance for the structural
stormwater management measures incorporated into the design of
the development, including a record of all inspections and copies of
all maintenance-related work orders. This log shall be made
available for inspection at the request of the Borough, county, or
the Department.
(7) The person responsible for maintenance identified under
Subsection B(2) above shall evaluate the effectiveness of the
maintenance plan at least once per year and adjust the plan and the
deed as needed.
(8) The person responsible for maintenance identified under
Subsection B(2) above shall retain and make available, upon
request by any public entity with administrative, health,
environmental, or safety authority over the site, the maintenance
plan and the documentation required by Subsection B(6) and (7)
above.
(9) The requirements of Subsections B(3) and (4) do not apply to
stormwater management facilities that are dedicated to and
accepted by the municipality or another governmental agency.
(10) In the event that the stormwater management facility becomes a
danger to public safety or public health, or if it is in need of
maintenance or repair, the municipality shall so notify the
responsible person in writing. Upon receipt of that notice, the
responsible person shall have 14 days to effect maintenance and
repair of the facility in a manner that is approved by the municipal
engineer or his designee. The municipality, in its discretion, may
extend the time allowed for effecting maintenance and repair for
good cause. If the responsible person fails or refuses to perform
such maintenance and repair, the municipality or county may
immediately proceed to do so and shall bill the cost thereof to the
responsible person.
C. Nothing in this section shall preclude the municipality in which the
major development is located from requiring the posting of a
performance or maintenance guarantee in accordance with N.J.S.A.
40:55D-53.
§ 321-12 SPRING LAKE CODE § 321-13
1:566
§ 321-13. Violations and penalties.
Any person who erects, constructs, alters, repairs, converts, maintains, or
uses any building, structure or land in violation of this chapter shall be
subject to the penalties outlined within the provisions set forth in § 321-13,
Violations and penalties, of this chapter.
§ 321-14. Mitigation plan.
A. Standards.
(1) For the purposes of this section, "mitigation" shall incorporate the
definition set forth in § 321-4 of this chapter and shall include
situations where the applicant has demonstrated the inability or
impracticality of strict compliance with the stormwater
management requirements set forth in N.J.A.C. 7:8 in addition to
the requirements set forth in this chapter.
(2) The Board having jurisdiction over an application requiring a
stormwater management plan shall have the jurisdiction to grant a
waiver from strict compliance with the performance requirements
of this chapter or the stormwater management plan. The waiver
may be granted where an applicant has demonstrated the inability
or impracticality of strict compliance with this chapter and/or the
stormwater management plan upon the following conditions. The
applicant must demonstrate one of the following:
(a) An inability to apply any of the best management practices and
methodologies as defined and approved herein and in the
stormwater management plan, due to an extraordinary and
exceptional situation uniquely affecting the subject property or
structures thereon, resulting in a peculiar and exceptional
practical difficulty or undue hardship; or
(b) That the purposes of this chapter and stormwater management
plan can be advanced by a deviation from the best
management practices and methodologies as defined and
approved herein and in the stormwater management plan,
where the benefits of such deviation substantially outweigh
any detriment.
(c) In requesting a waiver as to any application, the applicant may
submit as reasons for the waiver the site conditions of the
proposed project, including soils types; thin soil cover; low
permeability soils, and/or shallow depths to groundwater (high
groundwater levels); unique conditions which would create an
unsafe design; or conditions which would provide a
detrimental impact to public health, welfare, or safety.
(d) The waiver cannot be granted due to conditions created by the
applicant. If the applicant can comply with the requirements of
this chapter and the stormwater management plan through
§ 321-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 321-14
1:567
reducing the size of a project, the hardship is self-imposed,
and therefore the Board lacks jurisdiction to grant any waiver
under this section.
(e) The applicant must propose a suitable mitigation method
through the submission of a mitigation plan which will conform
as closely as possible to the design and performance standards
of this chapter, through structural or nonstructural stormwater
management measures, governing stormwater quality,
quantity, and groundwater recharge. Approval of a waiver or
exemption from any one of the three stormwater design
standard criteria which include groundwater recharge, water
quality, and water quantity provides no guarantee that, if
requested, an exemption or waiver will be granted for either or
both of the remaining criteria.
(f) Supporting evidence for an exemption or waiver shall be
prepared in the form of a stormwater management report
which will be signed and sealed by a New Jersey licensed
professional engineer. The report shall include, at a minimum:
[1] Detailed hydrologic and hydraulic calculations identifying
the sizing criteria for each BMP and the stormwater
collection system based upon the anticipated peak flow
and/or volume.
[2] A map of the planned project showing existing conditions
with drainage boundaries and land features, including
delineated wetlands, proposed improvements, including
all BMPs, grading, utilities, impervious features, and
landscaping.
[3] Construction details for each BMP, with appropriate
contact information.
B. Mitigation criteria. The mitigation requirements listed below offer a
hierarchy of options that are intended to offset the effect on
groundwater recharge, stormwater quantity control, and/or stormwater
quality control to an equal or greater extent than was created by the
granting of a waiver or exemption from the stormwater management
requirements. The mitigation criteria are listed below in order of
preference:
(1) Identify, design, and implement a compensating measure to
mitigate impacts. The preferred option is to identify and develop a
compensating mitigation project in the same drainage area as the
proposed development. In these cases, the applicant will address
the same issue within the design and performance standards for
which the variance or exemption is being sought, and demonstrate
that the proposed mitigating measures provide equal or greater
compensation to offset the noncomplying aspect of the stormwater
management system on site. The developer must also ensure the
§ 321-14 SPRING LAKE CODE § 321-14
1:568
long-term maintenance of the project as outlined in Chapters 8 and
9 of the NJDEP Stormwater BMP Manual. If the Borough agrees to
control a new stormwater management facility, arrangement in the
form of an escrow account will be made to stipulate the payment
amount, schedule, and long-term responsibilities of the facility to
ensure that it functions to capacity.
(2) Complete a project identified by the municipality as equivalent to
the environmental impact created by the exemption or variance.
(a) If a suitable site cannot be located in the same drainage area
as the proposed development, as discussed in Option 1, the
mitigation project may provide measures that are not directly
equivalent to the impacts for which the variance or exemption
is being sought, but that address the same issue to an equal or
greater extent. For example, if a variance is given because the
eighty-percent TSS requirement has not been met, the selected
project may address water quality impacts that increase the
siltation of a water body within the applicable HUC 14
subwatershed.
(b) If these criteria cannot be met on-site, Spring Lake may
consider granting a waiver from its adopted stormwater
management design and performance if an applicant is able to
identify and propose to complete a mitigation project that will
improve water quality, water quantity, or groundwater
recharge to an equal or greater extent than that for which the
applicant is seeking a waiver. As such, an appropriate
mitigation measure may take place within the larger confines
of the HUC-14 subwatershed area, or another portion of the
Borough, rather than the contributing area within which the
proposed project is located, if the Spring Lake Borough
Planning Board finds that the mitigation will equally protect
public health, safety and welfare, the environment, and public
and private property.
(3) Provide funding for municipal projects that would address existing
stormwater impacts. The third and least preferable stormwater
mitigation option is for the applicant to provide funding or partial
funding for an environmental enhancement project that has been
identified in this municipal stormwater management plan, or
towards the development of a regional stormwater management
plan. The contributed funds must be equal or greater than the cost
to implement the required on-site stormwater measure for which
relief is requested, including the cost of land, easements,
engineering design, and long-term maintenance. However, with
this option Spring Lake Borough, not the applicant, is ultimately
responsible for the design, property acquisition, construction,
construction management, maintenance (short-term and longterm)
and follow-up study, unless that project and its prospective
costs have been outlined within this mitigation plan.
§ 321-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 321-14
1:569
(4) An applicant may also propose a mitigation project on a site that
has not been identified in this mitigation plan. However, in each
circumstance the selection of a mitigation project must incorporate
the following requirements:
(a) The project must be within the same area that would
contribute to the receptor impacted by that project. If there is
no specific sensitive receptor impacted, then the location of the
mitigation project may be located anywhere within the
municipality, preferably at a location that would provide the
greatest benefit.
(b) Legal authorization must be obtained to construct the project
at the location selected. This includes the maintenance and any
access needs for the project throughout its operation.
(c) The mitigation project should be located close to the original
development project. If possible, the mitigation project should
be located at a similar distance from the identified sensitive
receptor. This distance should not be based on actual location,
but on a similar hydraulic distance to the sensitive receptor.
For example, if a project for which a waiver is obtained
discharges to a tributary, but the closest location discharges to
the main branch of a waterway, it may be more beneficial to
identify a location discharging to the same tributary.
(d) It is preferable to have one location that addresses any and all
of the performance standards waived, rather than one location
for each performance standard.
(e) The project location must demonstrate no adverse impacts to
other properties.
(f) For projects addressing the groundwater recharge
performance standard, a mitigation project site upstream of
the location of the actual project site is preferable to a
downstream location.
(g) Mitigation projects that address stormwater runoff quantity
can choose to provide storage for proposed increases in runoff
volume, as opposed to a direct peak flow reduction.
(h) Mitigation projects that address stormwater runoff quality can
choose to address another pollutant other than TSS, which has
been demonstrated to be of particular concern, such as
streams that have been listed as an impaired water body for
other pollutants. However, care must be taken to ensure that
waivers that are granted for the TSS requirements do not
result in the impairment of an existing unimpaired area.
C. Requirements for mitigation projects.
§ 321-14 SPRING LAKE CODE § 321-14
1:570
(1) Whether the applicant is proposing the mitigation project, or
Spring Lake has identified the project within this mitigation plan,
the following requirements for mitigation must be included in the
project submission:
(a) Impact from noncompliance. The applicant must provide a
table to show the required values, and the values provided in
the project, and include an alternatives analysis that
demonstrates that on-site compliance was maximized to the
greatest extent practicable.
(b) Narrative and supporting information regarding the need for
the waiver. The waiver cannot be granted for a condition that
was created by the applicant. If the applicant can provide
compliance with the stormwater rules through a reduction in
the scope of the project, the applicant has created the
condition and a waiver cannot be issued. The applicant must
provide a discussion and supporting information of the site
conditions that would not allow the construction of a
stormwater management facility to provide compliance with
these requirements, and/or if the denial of the application
would impose an extraordinary hardship on the applicant
brought about by circumstances peculiar to the subject
property. The site conditions to be considered are soil type, the
presence of karst geology, acid soils, a high groundwater table,
unique conditions that would create an unsafe design, as well
as conditions that may provide a detrimental impact to public
health, welfare, and safety.
(c) Sensitive receptor: identify the sensitive receptor related to
the performance standard for which a waiver is sought;
demonstrate that the mitigation site contributes to the same
sensitive receptor.
(d) Design of the mitigation project: provide the design details of
the mitigation project. This includes, but is not limited to,
drawings, calculations, and other information needed to
evaluate the mitigation project.
(e) Responsible party. The mitigation project submission must list
the party or parties responsible for the construction or
maintenance of the mitigation project. Documentation must be
provided to demonstrate that the responsible party is aware of,
has authority to perform, and accepts the responsibility for the
construction and the maintenance of the mitigation project.
Under no circumstances shall the responsible party be an
individual single-family homeowner.
(f) Maintenance. The applicant must include a maintenance plan
that addresses the maintenance criteria at N.J.A.C. 7:8-5 as
part of a mitigation plan. In addition, if the maintenance
§ 321-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 321-14
1:571
responsibility is being transferred to Spring Lake Borough,
or another entity, the entity responsible for the cost of the
maintenance must be identified. Spring Lake provides
applicants with the option of conveying the mitigation project
to the Borough, provided that the applicant funds the cost of
maintenance of the facility in perpetuity.
(g) Permits. The applicant is solely responsible to obtain any and
all necessary local, state, or other applicable permits for the
identified mitigation project or measure. The applicable
permits must be obtained prior to the municipal approval of
the project for which the mitigation is being sought.
(h) Construction. The applicant must demonstrate that the
construction of the mitigation project coincides with the
construction of the proposed project. A certificate of
occupancy or final approval by the municipality for the
application permit cannot be issued until the mitigation project
or measure receives final approval. Any mitigation projects
proposed by the municipality to offset the stormwater impacts
of the Borough's own projects must be completed within six
months of the completion of the municipal project, in order to
remain in compliance with Spring Lake's NJPDES General
Permit.
(2) In all instances, the Board having jurisdiction over the application
shall have the power to impose additional conditions as may be
appropriate under the circumstances of the application. The Board
shall make specific findings of fact and conclusions consistent with
Section 50 showing the inability or impracticality of strict
compliance with this chapter and the stormwater management
plan and justifying the approval of the applicant's mitigation plan,
in order to satisfy the reporting requirements of the municipality's
NJPDES permit and other applicable state law requiring the
submission of reports to any state or county review agency. The
Board shall also have the power to require mitigation as to
applications, which have received waivers from the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection.
(3) The Board having jurisdiction over an individual application may
determine that, due to the size of the project necessary to mitigate
for the waiver, it is not practical to require a mitigation project.

ARTICLE I
Right-of-Way Tree Removal and Protection
[Adopted by Ord. No. 33-2000 (§ 10-5 of the Revised General
Ordinances), as amended through Ord. No. 24-2002; amended in its
entirety 5-9-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-004 12-19-2017 by Ord. No.
2017-009]
§ 356-1. Findings and purpose.
The Borough Council of the Borough of Spring Lake finds that the
preservation, maintenance, protection and planting of trees aids in the
stabilization of soil by the prevention of erosion and sedimentation; reduces
stormwater runoff and the potential damage it may create; aids in the
removal of pollutants; provides protection against severe weather; aids
in the control of drainage and restoration of denuded soil subsequent
to construction or grading; provides a haven for birds and other wildlife
and otherwise enhances the environment; protects and increases property
values; preserves and enhances the Borough's physical and aesthetic
appearance; and generally protects the public health and safety, as well as
the general welfare. It is also believed that the use of deciduous street trees
along the rights-of-way, as set forth below, will encourage the development
of a shade canopy of tree branches over the streets within the Borough thus
enhancing the beauty of the area.
§ 356-2. Definitions.
The following definitions shall apply to this article:
LICENSED TREE EXPERT — An individual licensed pursuant to N.J.S.A.
45:15C-17 and appointed by the Mayor and Council for the purpose of
assisting with enforcing the terms of this article.
ORNAMENTAL TREE — A small tree at least six feet or more at mature
height (e.g., birch, dogwood, Japanese maple, cherry, crabapple, magnolia,
Bradford pear, willow).
RIGHT-OF-WAY — That area between the sidewalk and the curbing along
the street cartways.
STRUCTURE — A combination of materials to form a structure for
occupancy, use or ornamentation installed on a parcel of land.
TREE — A deciduous or evergreen tree with an anticipated mature height
of 20 feet or more (e.g., oaks, maples, London Planes, elms, spruce, pine,
fir, or hemlock).
§ 356-3. Permit required for removal of right-of-way trees.
No person shall cut down or remove any ornamental tree of a diameter of
three inches or more measured at a height of four feet above the ground,
nor any other tree of a diameter of six inches or more measured at a
height of 4 1/2 feet above the ground within the right-of-way without a

B. The applicant shall place a one-inch wide yellow ribbon to be provided
by the Borough around the trunk of each tree to be removed at a height
of 4 1/2 feet (or three feet for ornamental trees) above the ground so
that the proposed tree removal may be inspected in the field.
A. Upon receipt of an application for cutting or removal of trees or
ornamental trees, the Code Enforcement Officer shall inspect the site
on which the trees sought to be cut or removed including entire root
structure are located and shall evaluate the drainage and other physical
conditions existing on the subject property and adjoining properties.
The Code Enforcement Officer may consult with the Licensed Tree
Expert with regard to the application and any related issue. The Code
Enforcement Officer shall consider the following factors in deciding
whether to issue such permit:
(1) Whether the proposed cutting or removal would change existing
drainage patterns.
(2) Whether the proposed removal would allow soil erosion or increase
dust.
§ 356-3 SPRING LAKE CODE § 356-5
1:630
(3) Whether the proposed removal would constitute a significant
change in the screening between existing or proposed buildings on
contiguous lots or the wooded aspect of the lot as viewed from the
adjacent public road.

pursuant to the Municipal Land Use Law (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et
seq.).
C. Mitigation plan.
(1) With respect to the removal of all other trees, not described in
Subsection B above, the Code Enforcement Officer shall require a
mitigation plan (i.e., the planting of replacement trees at other
locations on the subject right-of-way or elsewhere within the
Borough). The purpose of such plan shall be the ultimate
replacement on the property of the trees being removed, giving due
consideration to a reasonable maturity period for new plantings.
(2) Trees to be planted along the road right-of-way shall be balled or
burlapped and not less than 2 1/2 inches in caliper, measured one

with the tree trunk. The trunk of the tree may be protected by tree
wrapping paper. The stake shall remain until directed by the Code
Enforcement Officer.
(5) The owner shall be required to see that the new planting is
adequately watered during the first year of its existence.
(6) Any tree improperly planted or not meeting these specifications

the occasion of shutting off of water or for any other cause whatsoever;
nor shall the Borough be held liable for any damage caused by increased
pressure being put on the mains during the times of fire, drills by the fire
companies or any other times; and all applications made hereunder shall

parties can reach an agreement on such terms, the Borough agrees to
support the company's petition to the Board for modification of the

programming shall be subordinate to the Borough's provision of EG
access programming on such channel.

equipment that it intends to discard from its PEG access studio serving
the Borough as described in the application for municipal consent, the
company shall, if reasonably feasible to do so, offer to donate such
equipment to the Borough prior to its disposal. Upon receipt of a
written request from the Borough, Cablevision shall inform the Borough
whether it has such equipment to donate. Donated equipment shall only
