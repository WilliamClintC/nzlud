ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER; AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
   WHEREAS, the Council of the City of Medina has had the matter of
codification and general revision of its ordinances before it for some time,
and
   WHEREAS, Council has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H.
Drane Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council,
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF MEDINA, STATE
OF OHIO, two-thirds of all members elected thereto concurring:
   Section 1. That the ordinances of the City of Medina, Ohio, of a general and
permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and
enacted as the Codified Ordinances of the City of Medina, Ohio, 1977.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk of Council, attached to this Ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent ordinance records of the City of Medina,
Ohio.
   Section 2. That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section 4 of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to January 9, 1977, which are inconsistent with any provision of
the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
Ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and codification.
   (b)    The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)    The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege.
      (2)    The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property.
      (3)    The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee

summary of new matter contained in the Codified Ordinances. Each section of the
1977 Codified Ordinances without a previous ordinance or resolution history, or
containing a subsection with the words "Adopting Ordinance", at the end
thereof, indicates that the section contains new matter ordained by this
Adopting Ordinance.
   Section 4. That this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety
and welfare of the City of Medina and its inhabitants, and for the further
reason that there exists an imperative necessity for the earliest publication
and distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and residents of
the City, so as to facilitate the administration and daily operation of the
City and avoid practical and legal entanglements. Wherefore, this Ordinance
shall take effect and be in full force immediately upon its passage and

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

shall be subject to referendum, to the extent and in the manner now or
hereafter provided by the Constitution, the laws of Ohio, or this Charter.
   Any initiative petition that proposes zoning regulation or zoning district
changes must first be submitted to the Planning Commission and then City
Council in the following manner before being certified to the election
authorities for placement on the ballot for consideration by the electorate. A
petition that proposes zoning regulation or district changes shall be filed
with the Director of Finance.  If the Director of Finance and the election
authorities determine that the petition is sufficient, the Director shall
within 10 days certify the sufficiency and validity of the initiative petition
and transmit the certification and a certified copy of the proposed ordinance
to the Council.  At the next regular meeting of Council, the Council shall at
once read and refer the same to the Planning Commission.  The Planning
Commission shall submit its report of the proposed ordinance and its
recommendations thereon to Council within 45 days of the Council’s referral. 
Upon receiving the report and recommendation of the Planning Commission, the
Council shall hold a public hearing on the proposed ordinance and shall take
final action thereon within 45 days from the date of the Planning Commission’s
report.  If Council fails to pass the proposed ordinance, or passes it in a
form different from that set forth in the petition, the committee of the
petitioners may require that it be placed on the ballot for consideration by
the electorate in its original form by certifying that fact to the Director of
Finance within 10 days after the final action on such proposed ordinance by
Council.  The Director shall forthwith certify the proposed ordinance to the
election authorities, and the election authorities shall place the proposed
ordinance on the ballot for the approval or rejection of the electorate at the
next general election occurring subsequent to 75 days from the date of that
certification. 
(Amended 3-2-04.)
SECTION VII-2. Recall.
   The electors shall have the power to remove from office by a recall election
any elected officer of the City. If  an elected officer shall have served for
six months of his term, a petition demanding  his removal may  be filed with 
the Clerk of the Council who shall note  thereon the name and address  of the
person filing  the petition  and  the date of such filing. Such petition  may
be circulated  in separate parts, but the separate parts shall be  bound
together  and filed as one  instrument. Each part shall contain the name and
office of the person whose removal is sought and a statement in not  more than
two hundred words of the grounds for the removal. Such petition shall be signed
by at least that number of electors which equals 25% of the electors voting at
the last preceding general election for that office. Within ten days after the
day on which such petition shall have been filed, the Clerk shall determine
whether or not it meets the requirements hereof. If the Clerk shall find the
petition insufficient, he shall promptly certify the particulars in which the
petition is defective, deliver a copy of his certificate to the person who
filed the petition with him, and make a record of such delivery. Such person
shall be allowed a period of twenty days after the day on which such delivery
was made in which to make the petition sufficient. If the Clerk shall find the
petition sufficient, he shall promptly so certify to the Council, shall deliver
a copy of such certificate to the officer whose removal is sought, and shall
make a record of such delivery. If such officer shall not resign within five
days after the day on which such delivery shall have been made, the Council
shall thereupon fix a day for holding a recall election, not less than sixty
nor more than seventy-five days after the date of such delivery. At such recall
election this question shall be placed on the ballot: "Shall (naming the
officer) be allowed to continue as (naming the office)?" with provision on the
ballot for voting affirmatively or negatively on such question. If a majority
of the votes cast at such election shall be voted affirmatively, such officer
shall remain in office. If a majority of the votes cast shall be voted
negatively, such officer shall be considered as removed, his office shall be
deemed vacant and such vacancy shall be filled as provided in this Charter. The
officer removed by such recall election shall not be eligible for appointment
to the vacancy created thereby.
(Approved by voters November 3, 1970.)
Article VIII
TAXATION AND FINANCES

firm or corporation to construct or operate a public utility on, across, over
or above any public street or public real estate within the City for a period
of not in excess of twenty-five years; and it may prescribe in the ordinance
the kind or quality of service or product to be furnished, the rate or rates to
be charged therefor, and such other terms as it shall deem conducive to the
public interest. Such franchise may be amended or renewed in the manner and
subject to the provisions established herein for original grants. No consent of
the owner of property abutting on any public street or public real estate shall
be necessary to the effectiveness of any such grant, amendment or renewal. All
such grants, amendments and renewals shall be made subject to the continuing
right of the Council to provide reasonable regulations for the operation of
such utilities with reference to such streets and public real estate, including
the right to require such reconstruction, relocation, alteration or removal of
structures and equipment used in such streets or public grounds as shall, in
the opinion of the Council, be necessary in the public interest.

members, submit any proposed amendment to the Charter to the elector; or, upon
receipt of a petition signed by not less than 15% of the electors of the City
voting at the last preceding general election setting forth any proposed
amendment to the Charter, it shall submit such proposed amendment to the
electors. The Council shall determine the manner of the submission of any
proposed amendment to the electors to the extent that such submission is not
governed by the Constitution of Ohio. If any such proposed amendment shall be
approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon, it shall become a part
of this Charter and become effective as provided in such amendment except that,
if two or more inconsistent proposed amendments on the same subject shall be
submitted at the same election, only the one of such amendments receiving the
largest affirmative vote, not less than a majority, shall become a part of the
Charter.

originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.  (ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

(Amended 1-3-05.)
111.12  LEGISLATION; COUNCIL BUSINESS; PRESENTATION AND PROCEDURE.
   (a)    It is deemed desirable to have any and all proposed legislation or
other matters requiring legislative action first brought to the attention of
Council at an open Council meeting. Unless it is determined to suspend the
Rules of Council in order to give immediate consideration to such proposed
legislation or other matters, they shall be referred promptly to an appropriate
committee pursuant to the provisions of Sections
111.10 and
111.11. No committee of Council need accept for consideration any proposed
legislation or other matters which will ultimately require legislative
determination unless the same has been first introduced in an open Council
meeting.
   (b)    Any proposed legislation, or other matters which have been referred
to and accepted by a committee of Council without first being introduced at an
open Council meeting, shall be promptly reported to Council by the President of
Council or by the chairman of such committee at the next meeting of Council,
and any such matters so considered shall likewise be clearly reflected in the
minutes of the committee in question. In no event shall any committee, or other
formal councilmatic body, give consideration to matters which are not promptly
made matters of public record pursuant to the provisions of these rules, unless
the matters under consideration are of such a nature that a premature
disclosure would be detrimental or prejudicial to the best interests of the
City.
   (c)    Prior to each meeting, the Clerk of Council shall prepare an agenda,
or written schedule of matters, to be brought before Council and shall cause a
copy of the same to be delivered to each member of Council together with the
full  text of any proposed legislation at least seventy-two hours prior to each
scheduled meeting. Such agenda or written schedule shall constitute the formal
schedule on business to be considered by Council at its next meeting, and
matters not included on such agenda shall not receive consideration by Council,
except upon suspension of these rules. (1-4-88; 1-3-11.)
   (d)    Any proposed legislation or other matter which is to be placed on the
agenda for action by Council shall be presented to the Clerk in a completed and
final state not later than 12:00  noon on the Wednesday preceding the meeting
of Council. Legislation presented to Council shall not include an emergency
clause. An emergency clause shall be added to legislation only upon a two-
thirds vote of the membership of Council.
   Any requests for Council action which are to be placed on the agenda shall
be presented to the Clerk in a completed and final state not later than 5:00
p.m. on the Tuesday preceding the meeting of Council.
   (e)    The Clerk shall have the responsibility for the systematic and
logical identification of proposed ordinances, resolutions and other matters to
be considered by Council, and he or she may assign identifying numbers or
designations to any such items which have been placed upon the agenda. He or
she may also, at his or her discretion, and in order to facilitate record
keeping, assign such identifying numbers or designations, or a different series
of identifying numbers or designations, to any other matters which have been
formally presented to Council or to a committee of Council, whether or not such
matters have been placed on the agenda.
(Passed 1-6-14.)
   (f)    Any request to withdraw a rezoning ordinance from a Council agenda
must be made by the rezoning applicant in writing to the Clerk of Council prior
to consideration of the ordinance on the Council floor. After filing of such a
request, the ordinance shall be withdrawn, except that a written statement of
intent as to temporary or permanent withdrawal must be submitted to the Clerk
of Council within fourteen days after the meeting from which agenda it was
withdrawn. Failure to resubmit such statement of intent will result in
automatic disapproval of the proposed rezoning. (Ord. 84-78. Passed 5-22-78.)
   (g)    It is deemed desirable that Council's consideration and finalization
of the annual budget ordinance be completed prior to the budget appearing on
the floor for final approval at the December meeting. It is understood,
however, that minor amendments may be required at said meeting and it is agreed
that such amendments may be proposed verbally.
   (h)    In the event a member of Council or the Administration desires to
propose an extensive amendment to the annual budget ordinance being considered
at the December meeting, it is in the best interest of Council that such
proposal be complete in the following respects:
(1)    Proposed amendments shall include complete budget control sheets for the
affected budget areas. Indicated on said documents shall be a column showing
fund amounts as proposed by title in the ordinance and a separate column
indicating the proposed amended amounts by title. All totals shall be
calculated for each area and column.
(2)    Where two or more budget areas within the same department are proposed
for amendment, there shall be, in addition to the information required in
subsection (h)(l) hereof, a written summary explaining the impact of the
proposed amendments. This summary shall also include a reconciliation of the
proposed changes with the available funds and/or the clear definition of the
sources of any additional revenues required to fund the proposed amendments.
These requirements shall also apply to amendments which affect budget areas in
more than one department.
   (i)    Proposed amendments and their accompanying documentation under
subsection  (h) hereof shall be provided to the members of Council, the Mayor,
the Finance Director, the Council Clerk and all Directors whose budgets are
affected at least twenty-four hours in advance of the Council meeting at which
the amendments are to be proposed.
   (j)    Should there arise a dispute as to whether a proposed amendment
constitutes a minor budget amendment (subsection (g) hereof) or an extensive
amendment (subsection (h) hereof), such determination shall be made on a case
by case basis by the majority vote of Council. (Approved 1-4-93)
   (k)    Special assessment public hearing. Before any legislative action is
taken on a special assessment project, the legislative body shall hold a public
hearing and shall give at least thirty days' notice of the time and place
thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipal corporation. The
Clerk of Council shall, at least twenty days prior to the public hearing,
notify by ordinary mail all record owners of each parcel of land to be
assessed.
(1-3-94.)
111.13  VOTING.
   (a)    At all meetings of Council, regular or special, voting shall be by
oral roll call, and the Clerk shall call the name of each Council member
present and record specifically whether such member has voted affirmatively or
negatively. The Clerk shall record also any abstentions or failures to vote.
   
   (b)    In each instance where a vote of the members of Council is required
the Clerk shall call the roll of such members in alphabetical sequence. On each
successive roll call, the Clerk shall begin with the Council members whose name
follows next in descending alphabetical sequence, and voting shall continue in
such rotating sequence from meeting to meeting.

135.01  SALE OR DISPOSITION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY.
   When it is determined that personal property owned by the Municipality no
longer serves a useful municipal purpose, and has an estimated value of less
than one thousand dollars, the Board of Control is authorized to provide for
the sale of such property including equipment, supplies and motor vehicles in
one of the following manners:
   (a)   By the acceptance of sealed bids to the highest and best bidder after
advertising not less than two times in a newspaper of general circulation in
the Municipality.
   (b)   By public auction, after advertising not less than two times in a
newspaper of general circulation in the Municipality.
   (c)   The Mayor, or his/her designee, shall estimate the fair market value
of the property to be sold using available valuation resources including, but
not limited to blue books, etc.  If an item is determined to have a fair market
value in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), then its sale shall be
authorized by ordinance and conducted as provided in subsection (b) herein.
   (d)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in subsections (a), (b) or
(c) hereof and regardless of the property’s value, City Council may authorize
the sale of personal property, including motor vehicles, road machinery,
equipment, tools or supplies, no longer needed for municipal purposes, or
obsolete or unfit for the use for which it was acquired, by internet auction. 
The Mayor may contract with a private internet-based auction system to conduct
the internet auction or the Municipality shall conduct such auction itself.
City Council shall adopt, during each calendar year, a resolution expressing
its intent to sell unneeded, obsolete and unfit property by internet auction. 
The resolution shall include a description of how the auction will be conducted
and shall specify the number of days for bidding on the property, which shall
be no less than fifteen days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal
holidays.  The resolution shall indicate whether the municipal corporation will
conduct the auction and shall establish the general terms and conditions of the
sale.  If a representative is known when the resolution is adopted, the
resolution shall provide contact information such as the representative’s name,
address and telephone number.
After adoption of the resolution, the legislative authority shall publish twice
in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipal corporation, notice of
its intent to sell unneeded, obsolete or unfit municipal personal property by
internet auction.  The second notice and any subsequent notice shall be
published not less than ten nor more than twenty days after the previous
notice.  A similar notice shall be posted continually throughout the calendar
year in a conspicuous place in the Municipal Building and if the Municipality
maintains a website on the internet, the notice shall be posted continually
throughout the calendar year at that website.
When property is to be sold by internet auction, the Board of Control may
establish a minimum price that will be accepted for specific items and may
establish any other terms and conditions for the particular sale, including
requirements for pick-up or delivery, method of payment, and sales tax.  This
type of information shall be provided on the internet at the time of the
auction and may be provided before that time upon request after the terms and
conditions have been determined.
As used in this section, “internet” means the international computer network of
both federal and nonfederal interoperable packet switched data networks,
including the graphical subnetwork called the world wide web.
   (e)   If the Board of Control determines that municipal personal property is
not needed for public use, or is obsolete or unfit for use for which it was
acquired, and that the property has no value, then the Mayor, or his/her
designee, may discard or salvage that property.
   (f)   The proceeds from the sale of such property shall be deposited in the
General Fund or in the appropriate fund as determined by the Director of
Finance in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code.
   (g)   The Mayor, or his/her designee, shall provide the Director of Finance
with a list of the items disposed of and the amount they were sold for, if any.
   (h)   The Director of Finance shall keep records with respect to the sale,
destruction or abandonment of surplus property disposed of in accordance with
this section.

145.07  DESIGN GUIDELINES/DEMOLITION CRITERIA.
   (Refer also to The City of Medina Guidelines for Historic Properties and
Districts.)
   Preface. The purpose of this chapter and of The City of Medina Guidelines
for Historic Properties and Districts is to preserve the architectural history
and integrity of existing buildings or structures and to ensure the procedures
and materials used are compatible with the existing building or structure and
help to ensure its preservation into the future.  These Guidelines are meant to
give architects and Owners design direction consistent with Chapter
145 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Medina. In principle, the Board
adopts the United States of America, Secretary of the Interior's Standards for
Rehabilitation.
   (a)   Preservation/rehabilitation/renovation.  With respect to preservation/
rehabilitation/renovation generally it is the interest of the Board that
buildings within the Historic District be preserved, thus maintaining the
character of the Historic District.  Consistent with the U.S. Secretary of the
Interior, Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties, the intent of
these Guidelines is to preserve and restore the features which establish a
building's architectural character while making alterations and renovations
necessary for the efficient and contemporary use of the building.
         The rehabilitation process assumes that some alterations may be
necessary to meet the needs of the building Owner and the health, safety, and
welfare of the building occupants. Such alterations should be done so as not to
destroy the materials and features which help to define a building's historic,
cultural and/or architectural character. The historic materials, features and/
or craftsmanship are important in defining the building character and should be
retained, protected, and repaired when possible.
         When the preservation of architectural features is not possible,
alterations should be done in a manner respectful of the existing  character,
but done in a manner that is representative of architectural design and
construction of contemporary times.
   (b)   Additions/new construction.  With respect to additions/new
construction to existing buildings and all new buildings or structures within
Historic Districts, it is generally the interest of the Board that such
additions/new construction shall be designed to enhance the character of the
Historic District. Consistent with the preface of this Chapter, new buildings
and additions should be representative of architectural design and construction
of contemporary times.
         Additions to existing buildings in the Historic District should be
designed so as not to detract from the original character of the building.
Whenever possible, additions should be located away from the primary or street
face of the building. The addition should be designed so as not to destroy
existing architectural features, such that the addition can be removed and the
building restored to its original condition. 
   New buildings in the Historic District shall be designed to be compatible
with other structures in the Historic District while still reflecting work of
contemporary times. Proximity of existing buildings to the new building will
affect the latitude in design constraints. An infill design should be more
consistent with adjoining buildings than a freestanding structure.
   (c)    Demolition. With respect to demolition, it is the interest of the
Board that Landmark Buildings and buildings within Historic Districts be
preserved and renovated for economically productive uses. The Board encourages
the saving and adaptive re-use of buildings significant to the character of the
Historic Districts and the history of the City.  Consistent with this intent,
the Board also realizes the Historic District is not a static environment, but
an ever changing and developing entity. Applications for demolition shall be
reviewed based on the overall impact the demolition will have on adjacent
Historic Landmarks, Historic Districts, and the community.
         In reviewing an application, the Board will also consider the impact
of the proposed use of the site on the Historic District. Demolition of
existing buildings which are not a significant loss to the Historic District to
allow for the construction of new development which enhances the Historic
District may be acceptable.
      (Ord. 75-07.  Passed 5-14-07.)
 
145.08  DESIGNATION CRITERIA FOR HISTORIC DISTRICTS OR LANDMARKS.
   In considering the designation of any place, building, structure, work of
art, or similar object in the City as an Historic District or Landmark, the
Historic Preservation Board shall apply the following criteria with respect to
such property:
   (a)   Its character, interest or value shall be part of the development,
heritage or cultural characteristics of the City, State or the United States;
   (b)   Its location shall be a site of a significant historical event;
   (c)   Its identification shall be with a person who significantly

   (g)   Its relationship shall be to other distinctive areas which are

   (h)   Its unique location or singular physical characteristics shall be
representative of an established and familiar visual feature of a neighborhood

      (Ord. 75-07.  Passed 5-14-07.)
145.09  DESIGNATION PROCEDURES FOR HISTORIC DISTRICTS OR LANDMARKS.
   (a)   A property (building, structure, place, or object) may be nominated as
an Historic Landmark or a group of properties may be nominated as an Historic
District by an individual, group, or by the Historic Preservation Board.  For
individual buildings, the property owner shall approve the nomination.  For a
district, dissention by property owners shall be less than 25%.  Each owner of
private property in a district has one vote regardless of how many properties
or what part of one property that party owns and regardless of whether the
property contributes to the significance of the district.
   (b)   When a proposal to establish an Historic District or to designate an
individual property or site as a Landmark for protection is received by or
initiated by the Historic Preservation Board, the owner or owners of included
properties shall be notified.
   (c)   The Historic Preservation Board shall consider the proposal in terms
of the criteria provided in Section
145.08.  Properties shall be documented to meet at least one of the criteria
listed. The Board shall make a recommendation to City Council.
   (d)   City Council shall give due consideration to the findings and
recommendations of the Historic Preservation Board in making its determination
with respect to the proposed designation of place, building, structure, or
object as an Historic District or Landmark.
(Ord. 75-07.  Passed 5-14-07.)
145.10  SEVERABILITY.
   If a court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge any provision of this
chapter invalid or unenforceable, then the remaining provisions of this chapter
shall not be affected thereby and shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest
extent permitted by law.
(Ord. 75-07.  Passed 5-14-07.)
145.11  WAYFINDING EVENT CABINETS.
   The purpose of the City of Medina Wayfinding Event Cabinets is to promote
downtown events and festivals.  The postings are intended for viewing by
pedestrians in the immediate vicinity of the kiosks.
   (a)   The event cabinets will be used for the posting of events and
festivals open to the general public occurring within the nine block Historic
District.
   (b)   The City of Medina will maintain a general calendar of events within a
portion of the cabinet throughout the year.
   (c)   Event postings are limited to a two week period prior to the scheduled

designee are the only representatives permitted to access and update the event
posting cabinets.
   (e)   Requested postings shall be submitted to the City of Medina for
placement in the cabinets by City staff or Main Street Medina.

payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
             (2)     The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (K)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under
the employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is

than twenty (20) days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty (20) days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
162.051 of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day.  For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been    purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
Chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty (20) days on which the employer
paid qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of

   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
162.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
162.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve (12) or
fewer days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the
employer is located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes
a tax applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on
those days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for
tax on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this
division, a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial
classification code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve (12) days for which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar
year on which the individual performed services at the refinery.

162.053 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; CASINO AND VLT.
   (A)    The Municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino
operator, as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and
section 3772.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, respectively, or a lottery sales
agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than
qualifying wages as provided in this section.
   (B)    If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by section

and withhold municipal income tax from the person's winnings at the rate of the
tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is
located.
   (C)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in trust
for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator shall
file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the Municipality,
providing the name, address, and social security number of the person from
whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such
deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of
the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of casino
gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information required by
the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall remit
electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld during the
preceding month.
      (2)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar

that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
      (3)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom

deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery

agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent

the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty percent (50%) of the tax
deducted and withheld;

Section
162.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld. 
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income."
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer. 
         (i)   “Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
162.03(23). 
         (ii)   “Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
162.03(1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
162.03(11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section
162.062 of this Chapter.

the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
162.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
162.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
162.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
     (D)     For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
            (1)     Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property

municipal corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal
corporation.
                 (b)     The property is delivered within the municipal
corporation from a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the
taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or
promotion of sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from
such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to the Municipality's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the Municipality or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the
Municipality. The Municipality shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)     (1)     Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located.  Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to the Municipality, if applicable, based

commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
            (2)     An individual who is a resident of the Municipality shall
report the individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the

a credit for taxes the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal
corporation to the extent that such credit is allowed under Section
162.081 of this Chapter.
     (G)     When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the
owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property,
payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity. 
   (H)   If in computing adjusted federal taxable income, the taxpayer deducted
any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an employee, the taxpayer
shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit
that was apportioned to the Municipality.  In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to the Municipality any
amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay
tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.

consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax

(2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of
the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code is
terminated, a valid election made under section 718.86 of the Revised Code is

   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax

income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
162.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
162.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
162.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
162.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
162.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
Chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1,
2016.

which case  they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts
were actually withheld.
                      (b)     An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a
subsequent taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark
stamped on the cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made
by electronic funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in
this division, "date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than
one date on the cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal
service.
        (2)     Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of

   (C)       (1)     The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the
Municipality or Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to
estimated taxes and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall
be as follows:
                      (a)     On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the
fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half
percent (22.5%) of the tax liability for the taxable year;
                      (b)     On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the
sixth month after the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent (45%)
of the tax liability for the taxable year;

taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable year.
                (2)     When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal

be paid with the return in accordance with Section
162.091 of this Chapter.
             
     (D)     (1)     In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
 162.10 of this Chapter  upon  the  amount  of  underpayment  for  the  period 
of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
                    (a)     For the first payment of estimated taxes each year,
twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount
of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
                    (b)     For the second payment of estimated taxes each
year, forty-five percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;

year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid
by the date prescribed for that payment.
              (2)     The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
 
   (E)     An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
                (1)     The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at
least ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
                (2)     The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at
least one hundred percent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of
the taxpayer for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately
preceding taxable year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer
filed a return with the municipal corporation under Section
162.091 of this Chapter for that year.
                (3)     The  taxpayer  is  an  individual  who  resides  in

162.08  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
162.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (A)     Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, when
taxable income of a resident of the Municipality is subject to a municipal
income tax in another municipality on the same income taxable under this
Chapter, such resident shall be allowed a credit of the amount of income tax
paid on such taxable income to such other municipality, equal to twenty-five
percent (25%) of the Municipal income tax in excess of one half of one percent
(0.50%). 
   (B)     When the taxable income of a resident of the Municipality is subject
to a municipal income tax in the Medina Montville Joint Economic Development
District on the same income taxable under this Chapter, such resident shall be
allowed a credit of the full amount of income tax paid on such taxable income
to the Medina Montville Joint Economic Development District.  In no event shall
the credit exceed the tax due the Municipality under this Chapter on such
taxable income.  (Ord. 90-18.  Passed 5-29-18.)

   (A)    As used in this section:
            (1)     (a)       "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a
compensation plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue
Code.
         (b)       "Qualifying loss" means the amount of compensation
attributable to a taxpayer's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, less the
receipt of money and property attributable to distributions from the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.  Full loss is sustained if no
distribution of money and property is made by the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.  The taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable
year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to that nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
                 (c)   (i)     "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax
rate for the taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to the
Municipality with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
                (ii)     If different tax rates applied for different taxable
years, then the "qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different
tax rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the
Municipality each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
               (d)     "Refundable credit" means the amount of the Municipality
income tax that was pad on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            (2)     If, in addition to Municipality, a taxpayer has paid tax to
other municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each
municipal corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal
corporation's proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax
paid by the taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            (3)     In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under
this section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the
Municipality for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
            (4)     The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to
the extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
         (a)     The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had
established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
                (b)       The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of
the employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified
deferred compensation.
                     (Ord. 90-18.  Passed 5-29-18.)

tax on income to a resident of the Municipality who works in a joint economic
development zone created under section 715.691 or a joint economic development
district created under section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised
Code to the same extent that it grants a credit against its tax on income to
its residents who are employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to
Section
162.081 of this Chapter.

162.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.

should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
162.096 of this Chapter. 
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality.  To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
162.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
162.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced

162.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. 
(Ord. 155-15.  Passed 12-14-15.)

              (2)     The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all
nonresident individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an

that individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,

on the taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld
for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form
1040 or, in the case of a return or request required by a qualified municipal
corporation, Ohio form IT 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any
other documentation necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended
return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return required by this
section electronically is not required to provide paper copies of any of the
foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such
copies after the return has been filed.   
              (3)     The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not
an individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net
profit return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of
only the following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form
1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and,

              (4)     A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an
annual net profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in
some other manner shall either mail the documents required under this division
to the Tax Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is

tax return.  The extended due date of the Municipality's income tax return
shall be the fifteenth (15th) day of the tenth month after the last day of the
taxable year to which the return relates.  An extension of time to file under

with the filing of the Municipality's income tax return.

taxpayer's requested extension.
              (3)     If the state tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers
the date for filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section
5474.08 of the Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an

              (4)     If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order
to ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality, the Tax
Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise
than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not otherwise required to
file annual returns.
              (5)     To the extent that any provision in this division

Municipality for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the Municipality.
                         (ii)     The person no longer provides services in the
Municipality and does not expect to be subject to Municipality income tax for
the taxable year.
         (b)     The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the Municipality.  The affidavit shall also
include the following statement:  "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the Municipality, make any sales in the Municipality, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the Municipality during the
taxable year.  If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
Municipality for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a
taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with the Municipality income tax
ordinance and rules and regulations."  The person shall sign the affidavit
under penalty of perjury.
         (c)     If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)
(b), the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file a tax return
for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)     Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)     If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the time-
stamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)   Taxes withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
162.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against
payment of the tax imposed on the taxpayer unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts
withheld. 
   (K)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
 
   (L)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules and regulations adopted by the Municipality
or Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter/
ordinance and of the Municipality's Ordinance, resolution, or rules and
regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
   (M)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)     (1)     As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
162.052 of this Chapter.

the municipal corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because
the person performed services at a worksite location within the municipal
corporation, and the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and
remitted all applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this
Chapter.  The tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a
taxpayer who has not complied with the provisions of this Chapter.

municipal corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal
corporation's income tax for the taxable year. The person shall provide the
notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains the person's circumstances,
including the location of the previous worksite location and the last date on
which the person performed services or made any sales within the municipal
corporation.  The affidavit also shall include the following statement:  "The
affiant has no plans to perform any services within the municipal corporation,
make any sales in the municipal corporation, or otherwise become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation during the taxable year.  If the
affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation for
the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to
properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal corporation, if such a
registration is required by the municipal corporation's resolutions,
ordinances, or rules."  The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of
perjury.
                      (c)     If a person submits an affidavit described in
division (N)(2) of this section, the tax administrator shall not require the
person to file any tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator
possesses information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances
described in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity
which results in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other
activity that results in municipal taxable income reportable to the
Municipality in the taxable year.  It shall be the responsibility of the
taxpayer to comply with the provisions of this Chapter relating to the
reporting and filing of municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income
tax return, even if an affidavit has been filed with the tax administrator for
the taxable year.  Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the tax
administrator from performing an audit of the person.

States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty (180) days thereafter. The application
shall be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
     (B)     (1)     If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall

installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. The Tax Administrator may
prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
            (2)     If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to the Municipality  before the one hundred eighty-
first day after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require

which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this Chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension

of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to

(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension

shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return.  If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)     An extension of time to file under this Chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)     If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the

or state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
section 162.19 of this Chapter  has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2)  of
this section  for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the
period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements
of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars ($10.00) or less,
no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth
in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
162.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the

      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.

162.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the

agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten

   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing.  Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses. 
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
162.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven (7) days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
(7) days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date of the annual
return or (90) ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is
later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing
the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable
year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return
on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time
for filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described
in division (A)(4) of Section
162.10 of this Chapter.

or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 90-18.  Passed 5-29-18.)
162.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information. 
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty (30) days of making the request, nothing in this
Chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person
to whom the request was directed pursuant to Section
162.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
162.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty (30) days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
162.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
162.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
162.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 90-18.  Passed 5-29-18.)
162.14  CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this Chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 90-18.  Passed 5-29-18.)
162.15  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with  the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or  the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 90-18.  Passed 5-29-18.)
162.16  OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of  one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
162.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 90-18.  Passed 5-29-18.)
162.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
(60) days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the
Tax Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent (20%), as determined by
voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
(60) days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 90-18.  Passed 5-29-18.)
162.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and  may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code. 
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty (60) days of when the vacancy was
created. Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the
expiration of the term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall
hold office for the remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall
impair the power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the
powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place.  This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)     No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment,  the manner in which the taxpayer
may appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be
directed, and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty (60) days after
the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within (60) sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under
division (C) of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to
prepare or waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the
taxpayer may appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney
at law, certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may
allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a
case, the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty (120) days after
the first day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety (90) days after the board's final
hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary
mail to all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen (15) days after issuing
the final determination.  The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the
board's final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review.  Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code.  For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing.  Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code.  For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing. 
(Ord. 90-18.  Passed 5-29-18.)
162.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
162.18 of this Chapter.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
162.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal.  The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
162.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
162.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 90-18.  Passed 5-29-18.)
162.20  ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the Municipality,
pursuant to this Chapter, grants authority to the Tax Administrator, to adopt
rules to administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on
the internet.

be subject to Sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code in lieu of the
provisions of this Ordinance.
   (E)     "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in section 718.01 of the Revised
Code, except that "taxpayer" does not include natural persons or entities
subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745 of the Revised Code.  "Taxpayer"
may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when such persons
are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
(Ord. 90-18.  Passed 5-29-18.)
162.97  COLLECTION AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   This Chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so
levied or enforcing any provisions of this Chapter are concerned, it shall
continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the

162.19.
   (B)     Annual returns due for all or any part of the last effective year of
this Chapter shall be due on the date provided in Section
162.091 as though the same were continuing.
(Ord. 90-18.  Passed 5-29-18.)
162.98  SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this Chapter, or any tax imposed
against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income
specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this Chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this Chapter.  It is hereby declared to be the intention of the
legislative authority of the Municipality that this Chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section
or part thereof not been included in this Chapter.
(Ord. 90-18.  Passed 5-29-18.)
162.99  VIOLATIONS; PENALTY.

Section
162.15 of this Chapter, division (A) of Section

private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner.  If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone.  In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated

         E.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of Ohio
R.C. 4505.101.

the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the

without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service.  The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this section.  The vehicle owner and the
operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and to

unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.

processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction. 
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator. 
Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,

the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section causes

subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the Police Department concerning

manner.  Subject to subsection (f)(4) of this section, the towing service or
storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:

motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more

property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or
upon or within the right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight
consecutive hours or longer, without notification to the Police Chief of the
reasons for leaving the vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the

property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;

the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the

person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the Chief of Police or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send
notice by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person having
the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is

or shall be removed from the property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.

days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.

   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which

court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect

(ORC 4511.12)
313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05  or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05  or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained

walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,

   (e)   Evidence; Tests. 
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood
under this subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains.  The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty. 
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them.  Whoever violates
subsection (a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while
under the influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of
a controlled substance.  The court shall sentence the offender for either
offense under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as
otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years.  The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. 
The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock
device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided

335.01  DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person

commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor.  When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27,
the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a

in a child restraint system that meets federal motor vehicle safety standards
or in an occupant restraining device as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.263.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual
inspection of a motor vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not

occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).

the vehicles or loads to be moved together with the length of the proposed
route and the impact the move will have on the roadway(s).  Generally seven (7)
working days should be allowed for processing any application.
      (3)   If, after reviewing the application and inspecting the proposed
route, the City Engineer’s Office determines that the proposed move would
materially affect the appearance, operation or maintenance of the roadway, a
conference will be scheduled to discuss possible revisions to the proposed
route and/or reductions in size and weight of the load.
   (d)   Bonds and Insurance.  Prior to issuance of a City of Medina Special
Hauling Permit, the applicant will be required to furnish the following:
      (1)   Liability Insurance:  A Certificate of Liability Insurance with
limits of  not less than $500,000 bodily injury liability, $1,000,000 each

unnecessary inconvenience to the traveling public.
   (g)   Types of Special Hauling Permits.
      (1)   Trip and return:  This permit is for overweight loads to travel to
and from a single location.  Tire sizes, axle weights, axle numbers, load
weight, gross weight, tractor and trailer empty weights, types and license
numbers will be required.  All axle weights must still be legal as stated in
the Ohio Department of Transportation’s Special Hauling Rules and Regulations. 
The applicant must call prior to moving in or out of the site.  The permit will
not be valid if no call is made to the Medina City Engineer’s Office prior to
each and every move.
      (2)   Annual overwidth:  This permit covers legal weight loads that are
from eight feet six inches up to and including twelve feet in width.  A single
permit will cover the tractor and any trailers or legal loads that fall within
this gross width for a period of one year.  The applicant is required to call
the Medina City Engineer’s Office prior to each move in order for the Medina
City Engineer to approve the route and decide whether an escort will be needed
for the move.  The permit is not valid if no call is made to the Medina City
Engineer’s Office prior to each and any move.
      (3)   Construction permit:  This permit provides a company undertaking a
project to permit the oversized loads going to and from a project on a
specified route for a specified period of time.  A permit is needed for each
tractor/trailer and load and a call must be made notifying the City Engineer’s
Office of moves each day.
      (4)   Special permits:  Permits that require special conditions will be
reviewed by the Medina City Engineer’s Office and any special arrangements,
routing, bonds, escorts, videoing of the roadway, contact with utilities, etc.,
will be made with the applicant and all applicable parties.  Each permit will
be reviewed individually to determine what arrangements will need to be handled
and whether the permit will be granted.  An example of a special move is a
“Super Load” or building/house move.
      (5)   The aforementioned four types of Special Hauling Permits will each
be reviewed by the Medina City Engineer, who will determine if an escort,
Medina Police and/or City Engineer, is required.
   (h)   Applicant’s Responsibilities.
      (1)   The applicant is responsible for following all safety requirements
listed under the Ohio laws such as signs, flaggers, escorts, axle weights,
etc.  The applicant is also responsible for any additional safety requirements
listed by the Medina City Engineer’s Office to insure a safe move.
      (2)   The applicant is responsible for the safety and accessibility of
the destination.  The roadway and site must be kept clear of all materials and
obstacles to the traveling public during the entering of any site.  Access to
the site should be easily accessible and inspected prior to the movement of the
vehicle and load.
   (i)   General Information on Fees.
      (1)   A fee payable to the City of Medina will be charged to cover the
cost of issuing a permit and inspecting the roadway and structures before,
during, and after the permitted movement.
      (2)   An application for a City of Medina Special Hauling Permit must be

charged for the movement of a load.
      (2)   An inspection fee will be charged when an inspector is required to
perform inspection at a time other than normal working hours.  All inspection
fees billed for an inspection at a time other than normal working hours will be
billed at one and one-half times the current inspection rate.
      (3)   Normal working hours are 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Monday through
Friday.  No movement of an oversize and/or overweight load may be made on State
Routes on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday as established by the Ohio
Revised Code, or on a City roadway, unless the Medina City Engineer’s Office
gives permission.  The inspection fee will be billed at one and one- half times
the current inspection rate if an inspector is required for an approved move
during other than normal working hours.
      (4)   An inspection fee will also be charged if the inspector is required
to wait longer than one hour for the load to arrive or commence movement at the
specified meeting time and location.  The permit holder will be billed for all
time exceeding one hour at the current inspection fee rate.
      (5)   All permit fees and charges, plus proof of bonds and insurance,
must be filed with the City of Medina Finance Department prior to permit
issuance by Medina Engineer’s Department.
      (6)   Permits pulled for violation by any law enforcement officer may
require the applicant to re-apply and submit an additional permit fee for any

rubber or other
similar substance, the actual width in inches of all such tires between the
flanges at the base of the tires, but in no event shall that portion of the
tire coming in contact with the road surface be less than two thirds the width
measured between the flanges.
   In the case of pneumatic tires, of rubber or other similar substance, the
total width of tires on all wheels shall be the actual width of all such tires,
measured at the widest portion thereof when inflated and not bearing a load.
   In no event shall the load, including the proportionate weight of vehicle
that can be concentrated on any wheel, exceed six hundred fifty pounds to each
inch in width of the tread as defined in this section for solid tires, or each
inch in the actual diameter of pneumatic tires measured when inflated and not
bearing a load.

trolley, load, object, or structure operated or moved upon improved public
highways, streets, bridges, or culverts shall not exceed six hundred fifty
pounds per inch width of pneumatic tire, measured as prescribed by section
5577.03 of the Revised Code.
   (b)   The weight of vehicle and load imposed upon the road surface by
vehicles with pneumatic tires shall not exceed any of the following weight
limitations:
      (1)   On any one axle, twenty thousand pounds;

      (3)   On any two or more consecutive axles, the maximum weight as
determined by application of the formula provided in division (c) of this
section.
   (c)   For purposes of division (b)(3) of this section, the maximum gross
weight on any two or more consecutive axles shall be determined by application
of the following formula:
   W = 500((LN/N-1) + 12N + 36).
   In this formula, W equals the overall gross weight on any group of two or
more consecutive axles to the nearest five hundred pounds, L equals the
distance in rounded whole feet between the extreme of any group of two or more
consecutive axles, and N equals the number of axles in the group under
consideration.  However, two consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry a gross
load of thirty-four thousand pounds each, provided the overall distance between
the first and last axles of such consecutive sets of tandem axles is thirty-six
feet or more.
   (d)   Through June 30, 1996, as an alternative to division (b) of this
section, the weight of vehicle and load imposed upon a road surface that is not
part of the interstate system by vehicles with pneumatic tires shall not exceed
any of the following weight limitations:
      (1)   On any one axle, twenty thousand pounds;
      (2)   On any two successive axles:
         A.   Spaced four feet or less apart, and weighed simultaneously,
thirty- four thousand pounds;
         B.   Spaced more than four feet apart, and weighed simultaneously,
thirty-four thousand pounds, plus one thousand pounds per foot or fraction
thereof, over four feet, not to exceed forty thousand pounds;
      (3)   On any three consecutive load-bearing axles designed to equalize
the load between such axles and spaced so that each such axle of the three-axle
group is more than four feet from the next axle in the three axle group and so
that the spacing between the first axle and the third axle of the three-axle
group is not more than nine feet, and with such load-bearing three-axle group
weighed simultaneously as a unit:
         A.   Forty-eight thousand pounds, with the total weight of vehicle and
load not exceeding thirty-eight thousand pounds plus an additional nine hundred
pounds for each foot of spacing between the front axle and the rearmost axle of
the vehicle;
         B.   As an alternative to division (d)(3)A. of this section, forty-two
thousand five hundred pounds, if part of a six-axle vehicle combination with at
least twenty-feet of spacing between the front axle and rearmost axle, with the
total weight of vehicle and load not exceeding fifty-four thousand pounds plus
an additional six hundred pounds for each foot of spacing between the front
axle and the rearmost axle of the vehicle.
      (4)   The total weight of vehicle and load utilizing any combination of
axles, other than as provided for three-axle groups in division (d) of this
section, shall not exceed thirty-eight thousand pounds plus an additional nine
hundred pounds for each foot of spacing between the front axle and rearmost
axle of the vehicle.
   (e)   Notwithstanding divisions (b) and (d) of this section, the maximum
overall gross weight of vehicle and load imposed upon the road surfaces shall
not exceed eighty thousand pounds.

more consecutive axles whose centers may be included between parallel
transverse vertical planes spaced more than forty inches but nor more than
ninety-six inches apart, extending across the full width of the vehicle.
   (h)   This section does not apply to passenger bus type vehicle operated by
a regional transit authority pursuant to sections 306.30 to 306.54 of the
Revised Code.
   (i)   It is the intent of the general assembly that through June 30, 1996,
either division (b) or (d) of this section shall apply to the weight of a
vehicle and its load imposed upon any road surface that is not a part of the
interstate system by vehicles with pneumatic tires.  It is the further intent
of the general assembly that, as between divisions (b) and (d) of this section,
only the division that yields the highest total gross vehicle weight limit
shall be applied to any particular vehicle.  Once that division is determined,
only the limits contained in the subdivisions of that division shall apply to
that vehicle.

or culverts.  The maximum wheel load of any one wheel of any such vehicle shall
not exceed six hundred fifty pounds per inch width of tire, measured as
prescribed by section 5577.03 of the Revised Code, nor shall any solid tire of
rubber or other resilient material, on any wheel of any such vehicle, be less
than one inch thick when measured from the top of the flanges of the tire
channel. 
   The weight of vehicle and load imposed upon the road surface by any two
successive axles, spaced four feet or less apart, shall not exceed nineteen
thousand pounds for solid tires, or by any two successive axles spaced more
than four feet but less than eight feet apart shall not exceed twenty-four
thousand pounds for solid tires; or by any two successive axles, spaced eight
feet or more apart, shall not exceed twenty-eight thousand pounds for solid
tires; nor shall the total weight of vehicle and load exceed, for solid rubber
tires, twenty-eight thousand pounds plus an additional six hundred pounds for
each foot or fraction thereof spacing between the front axle and the rearmost
axle of the vehicle, nor shall the weight of vehicle and load imposed upon the
road surface by any vehicle equipped with solid rubber tires, exceed eighty per
cent of the permissible weight of vehicle and load as provided for pneumatic
tires.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when a vehicle is towing another
vehicle, such drawbar or other connection shall be of a length such as will
limit the spacing between nearest axles of the respective vehicles to a
distance not in excess of twelve feet and six inches.  If the provisions of
this section are held to exceed the weight limitations or other provisions set
forth in the “Federal Aid Highway Act of 1958,” 72 Stat. 902, 23 U.S.C. 127,
this section shall become null and void to the extent of such inconsistency.

vehicle is equipped with suitable metal protectors or substantial flexible
flaps on the rearmost wheels of such vehicle or combination of vehicles to
prevent, as far as practicable, the wheels from throwing dirt, water or other
materials on the windshields of following vehicles.  Such protectors or flaps
shall have a ground clearance of not more than one- third of the distance from
the center of the rearmost axle to the center of the flaps under any conditions
of loading of the vehicle, and they shall be at least as wide as the tires they
are protecting.  If the vehicle is so designed and constructed that such
requirements are accomplished by means of fenders, body construction or other
means of enclosure, then no such protectors or flaps are required.  Rear wheels
not covered at the top by fenders, bodies or other parts of the vehicle shall
be covered at the top by protective means extending at least to the center line

353.02  DECRIMINALIZATION; IMPOUNDMENT AND IMMOBILIZATION OF VEHICLE.
   (a)   The commission of a parking infraction shall not be considered a
criminal offense for any purpose.
   (b)   A vehicle involved in three or more parking infractions in which
judgments or default judgments have been filed with the Clerk of the Medina
Municipal Court pursuant to Section
353.07(c) is subject to impoundment or immobilization by law enforcement
officers of the City or their agent.  Impoundment or immobilization, pursuant
to this section, is permitted without regard to whether or not the vehicle, at
the time of impoundment or immobilization, is legally parked.  The owner of a
vehicle impounded pursuant to this chapter shall be liable for impoundment fees
and storage charges as provided in Section
353.07.
 
   (c)   A vehicle so impounded or immobilized shall be released to the owner
upon the owner’s presenting a valid certificate of title to the vehicle to the
Violations Clerk of the Parking Violations Bureau, upon the owner’s either
paying the fines, penalties, fees and costs due on the judgments or default
judgments that led to the impoundment or immobilization or posting a bond equal
to or exceeding the amount of such fines, penalties, fees and costs.  In no
case, however, shall the owner of a vehicle impounded or immobilized pursuant
to this chapter be required to post a bond in excess of one thousand dollars
($1,000) to obtain release of the vehicle.
 
   (d)   Notwithstanding divisions (b), (c) and (e) of this section, a vehicle
parked, stopped or standing on a public street or highway in commission of a
parking infraction is subject to impoundment if the law enforcement officer
issuing the parking infraction determines that the vehicle is substantially
impeding or hindering the movement of other traffic.
 
   (e)   The impoundment or immobilization of a motor vehicle pursuant to this
chapter shall occur only after the expiration of the ten-day period authorized
by Section
353.07(c) for the payment of a civil judgment or default civil judgment.
 
   (f)   Any section of these Codified Ordinances that is in conflict with this
chapter is repealed. 
(Ord. 63-07.  Passed 4-23-07.)
353.03  PARKING TICKET; SERVICE AND LIABILITY
   (a)   The parking ticket form adopted in Section
353.09 shall be used by law enforcement officers in all cases in which a person
is charged with committing a parking infraction within the City.  The parking
ticket shall be the summons and complaint for purposes of this chapter.
 
   (b)    A law enforcement officer who issues a parking ticket for a parking
infraction shall complete the ticket by identifying the parking infraction
charge; recording the license plate number and the type, make or model of the
vehicle; and indicating the date, time and place of the charged parking
infraction.  The officer shall sign the ticket, affirm the facts it contains
and file a copy with the Violations Clerk.  If the operator of the vehicle is
present, the officer shall also record on the ticket the name of the operator
(in a space provided on the ticket for identification of the offender) and then
shall personally serve the parking ticket upon the operator.  If the operator
of the vehicle is not present, the officer shall insert the word “owner” in the
space provided on the ticket for identification of the offender and then shall
constructively serve the parking ticket upon the owner of the vehicle by
affixing the ticket to the vehicle in a conspicuous place.
   Constructive service of a parking ticket upon an owner of a vehicle by such
affixation or the procedure described in subsection (d) hereof has the same
force and effect as if the parking ticket were personally served on both the
owner and operator of the vehicle at the time of the violation and potentially
subjects both the owner and the operator of the vehicle, whose act or omission
resulted in the parking infraction, if different, to the same fine and the same
penalties, fees and costs for failure to timely answer or to appear, if a
hearing is requested.
 
   (c)   The original of a parking ticket issued pursuant to this section or
any true copy thereof shall be considered a record kept in the ordinary course
of business of the City and of the law enforcement agency whose officer issued
it, and shall be prima-facie evidence of the facts it contains.
 
   (d)   An operator of a vehicle who is not the owner of the vehicle, but who
operates it with the express or implied permission of the owner, is the agent
of the owner for purposes of the receipt of a parking ticket served in
accordance with this section.  Personal service of a parking ticket upon the
operator, in accordance with this section, constitutes constructive service
upon the owner for purposes of this chapter. The operator of a rented or leased
vehicle whose act or omission resulted in an alleged parking infraction shall
not be considered an agent of the owner if the owner is engaged in the business
of renting and leasing vehicles pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement
and if the owner follows the procedures set forth in Section
353.08.
 
   (e)   Except as provided in Section
353.08, when a parking ticket is issued for a parking infraction and is served
pursuant to this section, the operator of the vehicle whose act or omission
resulted in the parking infraction for which the ticket was issued and the
owner of the vehicle involved in the parking infraction, if different, are
jointly liable for the parking infraction and for any fine, penalty, fees or
costs arising out of the parking infraction.  Any owner of a vehicle who pays
any fine, penalty, fees or costs imposed for a parking infraction pursuant to
this chapter may recover the amount so paid from the operator of the vehicle
whose act or omission resulted in the parking infraction. 
 
   (f)   No person who is served with a parking ticket pursuant to this section
shall be arrested as a result of the commission of a parking infraction.
(Ord. 63-07.  Passed 4-23-07.)
353.04  PARKING VIOLATIONS BUREAU.
   A Parking Violations Bureau is hereby established pursuant to Ohio R.C.
4521.04.
   (a)   The Bureau shall be a division within the Medina Police Department. 
The Bureau has jurisdiction over each parking infraction that occurs within the
City.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, each parking
infraction that occurs within the City of Medina and the enforcement of such
parking infraction shall be handled pursuant to and governed by this chapter.
   (b)   The operating costs of the Parking Violations Bureau shall be paid by
the City of Medina.  The Mayor shall appoint a Violations Clerk, necessary
clerical employees and hearing examiners.  No person shall be employed as a
hearing examiner unless such person is an attorney admitted to the practice of
law in the State of Ohio or is a former law enforcement officer.
   (c)   The fines, penalties, fees and costs established for a parking
infraction shall be collected, retained and disbursed by the Violations Clerk. 
The Clerk shall issue tickets for law enforcement officers for the City of
Medina and shall describe conditions for issuance and accounting procedures.
   (d)   The Mayor may contract with any non-governmental entity to provide
services in processing, collecting and enforcing parking tickets issued by law
enforcement officers and civil judgments and default civil judgments entered
pursuant to this chapter.
      (Ord. 63-07.  Passed 4-23-07.)
353.05  ANSWERS TO CHARGE; JUDGMENTS.
   (a)   A person who is personally or constructively served with a parking
ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction may answer the charge by
appearing personally before the Traffic Violations Bureau or by mail.  An
answer shall be made within ten (10) days from the date of the infraction and
shall be in one of the following forms:
      (1)   An admission that the person committed the parking infraction by
payment of any fine arising out of the infraction;
      (2)   An admission that the person committed the parking infraction, with
an explanation of the circumstances surrounding the parking infraction; or
      (3)   A denial that the person committed the parking infraction and a
request for a hearing relative to the infraction.  If the person desires the
presence, at the hearing, of the law enforcement officer who issued the parking
ticket, the person must request the officer’s presence in his or her answer.
   (b)   A person who admits that he or she committed a parking infraction
shall, and a person who admits that he or she committed a parking infraction
with explanation may, when he or she makes his or her answer, pay the fine
arising out of the infraction admitted to the Violations Clerk.
   (c)   A person who admits that he or she committed a parking infraction with
explanation shall submit evidence to the Parking Violations Bureau that
explains the circumstances surrounding the parking infraction.  The evidence
may be submitted in person or, to avoid the necessity of personal appearance
may be sent as affidavits and other documentary evidence by mail. The Bureau,
when it receives an answer admitting that a person committed a parking
infraction with explanation, shall promptly determine whether or not the
explanation mitigates the fact that the person committed the parking infraction
and shall notify the person, in writing, of its determination.
   If the Bureau determines that the explanation mitigates the fact that the
person committed the parking infraction, the Bureau shall eliminate or reduce
the amount of the fine arising out of the parking infraction.  If the fine is
eliminated or reduced and the person has previously paid the fine, the amount
paid in excess of the revised fine shall be returned to the person.  If the
fine is eliminated or reduced and the person has not previously paid the fine,
the person shall pay only the amount of the revised fine.
   If the Bureau determines that the explanation does not mitigate the fact
that the person committed the parking infraction, the person owes the entire
amount of the fine arising out of the parking infraction, and if the person has
not previously paid the fine, the person shall pay the entire amount of the
fine.  If a person admits that he or she committed a parking infraction with
explanation and the person fails to pay the amount of the fine due within ten
(10) days after receiving notice of the Bureau’s determination the amount of
the fine due shall be considered a judgment and shall be treated as if it were
a judgment rendered subsequent to a hearing held pursuant to Section
353.07.
 
   (d)   A person who denies that he or she committed a parking infraction
shall be granted a hearing concerning the infraction.  The Bureau shall set a
date for the hearing and notify the person, in writing, of the date, time and
place of the hearing.  The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing examiner of
the Parking Violations Bureau in accordance with Section
353.07.
   (e)   If a person who is personally or constructively served with a parking
ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction fails to timely answer
the charge, as provided in division (a) of this section, the Parking Violations
Bureau shall issue the proper notification of infraction, pursuant to Section
353.06 and proceed according to such section.  Failure to timely answer a
charge may result in the imposition of an additional penalty of five dollars
($5.00).
   (f)   The issuance of a parking ticket; the filing of or failure to file an
answer by a person personally or constructively served with the ticket; the
substance of an answer; the payment of any fine, penalty, fee or cost; and any
other relevant information shall be entered in the records of the Parking
Violations Bureau.
(Ord. 63-07.  Passed 4-23-07.)
353.06  FAILURE TO ANSWER.
   (a)    When a person is personally or constructively served with a parking
ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction in accordance with
Section
353.03, and the person fails to answer the charge within the time specified in
Section
353.05, the Parking Violations Bureau shall send a notification of infraction
as follows:
      (1)   If the person who fails to answer was the operator of the vehicle
involved in the parking infraction at the time of the commission of the
infraction and was personally served with the parking ticket, a notification of
infraction shall be sent to that person and, additionally, if such person is
not the owner of the vehicle, as determined from the records of the Bureau of
Motor Vehicles, a notification of infraction also shall be sent to the owner at
his or her most recent address appearing in such records;
      (2)    If the person who fails to answer was the owner of the vehicle and
was constructively served with the parking ticket, a notification of infraction
shall be sent to the owner at his or her most recent address appearing in the
records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles.
   (b)   A notification of infraction shall be sent “by first class mail”
within twelve (12) months after the expiration of the time specified in Section
353.05 for the making of an answer, and shall contain all of the following:
(1)   An identification of the parking infraction with which the person was
charged and the time and date of the infraction, which identification may be a
copy of the parking ticket charging the parking infraction that was personally
or constructively served upon the person;
      (2)   An identification of the amount of the fines, penalties, fees and
costs that are due arising out of the parking infraction;
      (3)   A warning that the person must answer the parking infraction
charged in the ticket within thirty (30) days or a default civil judgment in
the amount of the fines, penalties, fees and costs due may be entered against
the person;
      (4)   A description of the allowable answers that may be made and
notification that the person will be afforded a hearing before the Bureau if he
or she denies in his or her answer that he or she committed the parking
infraction;
      (5)   An identification of the manner in which and the entity to which an
answer may be made;
      (6)   A warning that if the person fails to appear at a requested
hearing, a default civil judgment in the amount of the fines, penalties, fees
and costs due may be entered against the person; and
      (7)   A warning that the registration of the vehicle involved in the
parking infraction, if the vehicle is registered in the State, may not be
renewed or transferred if a civil judgment or a default civil judgment is
entered against the person, until the judgment is paid or until it is otherwise
finally disposed of as provided by law.
   (c)   A person who receives notification of infraction pursuant to this
section may answer the parking infraction with which he or she is charged, and
that is identified in the notification of infraction, by any of the means
provided in Section
353.05(a) for answers to parking infractions charged in a parking ticket.  Such
answer shall be made within thirty (30) days after the date on which the
notification of the infraction was mailed, and shall be in one of the forms
specified in Section
353.05 (a) for answers to parking infractions charged in a parking ticket,
except that if the answer includes payment of the fine arising out of the
parking infraction, any penalty arising out of such infraction also shall be
paid.  The answer shall be governed by the provisions of Section
353.05 (b) through (d) for answers relative to parking infractions charged in a
parking ticket, except that any determination of the amount to be paid under an
answer admitting the commission of the parking infraction with explanation also
shall consider any penalty, fee or cost arising out of such infraction.
   (d)   If a person who is issued a notification of infraction fails to timely
answer, as provided in division (c) of this section, the failure to answer
shall be considered an admission that the person committed the parking
infraction, and a default civil judgment, in the amount of the fines, penalties
and costs due may be entered against the person.  Failure to timely answer the
parking infraction identified in the notification of infraction may result in
the imposition of an additional penalty of five dollars ($5.00) and a judgment
against such person for the court costs incurred.
   (e)   The sending of a notification of infraction; the filing of or failure
to file an answer by the person to whom it is sent; the substance of an answer;
the payment of any fine, penalty, fee or cost; and any other relevant
information shall be entered in the records of the Bureau.
(Ord. 63-07.  Passed 4-23-07.)
353.07  HEARINGS.
   (a)    If a person is personally or constructively served with a parking
ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction or receives a
notification of infraction and, in his or her answer to the charge, denies that
he or she committed the infraction, the Parking Violations Bureau shall conduct
a hearing to determine if the person committed the parking infraction.  Each
hearing shall be conducted by a hearing examiner of the Bureau in such manner
as the hearing examiner considers appropriate.  Rules regarding the
admissibility of evidence shall not be strictly applied in the hearing, but all
testimony shall be under oath.
   At the hearing, the City has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that the person for whom the hearing is being conducted committed
the parking infraction.
   If the person, in his or her answer, denies that he or she committed the
parking infraction and requests the presence at the hearing of the law
enforcement officer who issued the parking ticket, such officer shall be
required to attend the hearing, unless the hearing examiner determines that the
officer’s presence is not required.  If the officer’s presence at the hearing
has been requested and the officer is unable to attend the hearing on the date
and at the time scheduled, the hearing examiner may grant a reasonable
continuance.
   The person for whom the hearing is being conducted may present any relevant
evidence and testimony at the hearing.  The person does not have to attend the
hearing if he or she submits documentary evidence to the hearing examiner prior
to the day of the hearing.
   The City shall submit the original parking ticket that was personally or
constructively served on the person, or a true copy of that ticket, and
information from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles that identifies the owner of the
vehicle.  The ticket and the information in proper form is prima-facie evidence
that the registered owner of the vehicle was the person who committed the
parking infraction.  The City must present additional evidence and testimony at
the hearing and does not have to be represented at the hearing by an attorney.
   (b)   If a person for whom a hearing is to be conducted under division (a)
of this section appears at the scheduled hearing or submits evidence in
accordance with such division, the hearing examiner shall consider all evidence
and testimony presented and shall determine whether or not the City has
established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the person committed the
parking infraction.  If the hearing examiner determines that the person
committed the infraction, an order indicating the determination as a judgment
against the person and requiring the person to pay the appropriate fine and any
additional penalties, fees and costs shall be entered in the records of the
Parking Violations Bureau.
   If a person for whom a hearing is to be conducted under division (a) of this
section fails to appear at the scheduled hearing and fails to submit evidence
in accordance with such division, the hearing examiner, if he or she
determines, from a preponderance of the evidence and testimony presented at the
hearing, that the person committed the parking infraction, shall enter a
default judgment against the person and require the person to pay the
appropriate fine and any additional penalties, fees and costs.  A default
judgment entered under this division shall be entered in the records of the
Parking Violations Bureau.
   If a person who is sent a notification of infraction pursuant to Section
353.05 does not timely answer, as provided in Section
353.05(e), the hearing examiner of the Parking Violations Bureau, if he or she
determines from a preponderance of the evidence and testimony presented to him
or her by the local authority that the person committed the parking infraction,
shall enter a default judgment against the person and require the person to pay
the appropriate fine and any additional penalties, fees and costs.  A default
judgment entered under this division shall be entered in the records of the
Bureau.
   If the hearing examiner does not determine, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that a person in any of the classes described in this division
committed the parking infraction, the hearing examiner shall enter judgment
against the City, shall dismiss the charge of the parking infraction against
the person and shall enter the judgment and dismissal in the records of the
Parking Violations Bureau.
   A default judgment entered under this section may be vacated by the hearing
examiner who entered it if all of the following apply:
      (1)   The person against whom the default judgment was entered files a
motion with the Parking Violations Bureau within one (1) year of the date of
entry of the judgment;
      (2)   The motion sets forth a sufficient defense to the parking
infraction out of which the judgment arose; and
      (3)   The motion sets forth excusable neglect as to the person’s failure
to attend the hearing or answer the notification of infraction.
   (c)   Payment of any judgment or default judgment entered against a person
pursuant to this section shall be made to the Violations Clerk within ten (10)
days of the date of entry of such judgment.  All money paid in satisfaction of
a judgment or default judgment shall be disbursed by the Violations Clerk and
the Clerk shall enter the fact of payment of the money and its disbursement in
the records of the Bureau.  If payment is not made within this time period, the
judgment or default judgment shall be filed with the Clerk of the Medina
Municipal Court and, when so filed, shall have the same force and effect as a
money judgment in a civil action rendered in such Court.
   As required by Ohio R.C. 4521.08(C), judgments and default judgments filed
with the Medina Municipal Court pursuant to this division shall be maintained
in an index and judgment roll separate from other judgments rendered in such
Court.  Computer printouts, microfilm, microdot, microfiche or other similar
data recording techniques may be utilized to record such judgments.  When a
judgment or default judgment is file with the Court, execution may be levied
and such other measures may be taken for its collection as are authorized for
the collection of an unpaid money judgment in a civil action rendered in the
Medina Municipal Court.  The Court may assess costs against the judgment debtor
of not more than ten dollars ($10.00) for each parking infraction, to be paid
upon satisfaction of the judgment.
   (d)   Any person against whom a judgment or default judgment is entered
pursuant to this section, and the City, if a judgment is entered against the
City pursuant to this section, may appeal the judgment or default judgment to
the Medina Municipal Court by filing notices of appeal with the Parking
Violations Bureau and the Court within fifteen (15) days of the date of entry
of the judgment and by the payment of such reasonable costs as the Court
requires.  The City, however, shall be exempt from such costs.  Upon the filing
of such an appeal, the Court shall schedule a hearing date and notify the
parties of the date, time and place of the hearing.  The hearing shall be held
by the Court in accordance with the rules of the Court.  Service of a notice of
appeal under this division by a person does not stay enforcement and collection
of the judgment or default judgment from which appeal is taken by the person
unless the person who files the appeal posts bond with the Parking Violations
Bureau in the amount of the judgment, plus courts costs, at or before service
of the notice of appeal.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the judgment on appeal to the
Medina Municipal Court is final, and no other appeal of the judgment of the
Parking Violations Bureau or an appeal of the judgment of the Court may be
taken.
   (e)   A default judgment entered pursuant to this section may be filed with
the Court under division (c) of this section at any time within three (3) years
after the date of issuance of the parking ticket, charging the parking
infraction out of which the judgment arose.  This division applies to any
ticket issued for an offense that would be a parking infraction on or after the
effective date of this section, if the ticket was issued within three (3) years
prior to the effective date of this section and a warrant has not been issued
and served on the operator or owner of the vehicle involved in the offense. 
(Ord. 63-07.  Passed 4-23-07.)
353.08  NONLIABILITY OF OWNER.
   (a)   An owner of a vehicle is not jointly liable with an operator of such
vehicle whose action or omission resulted in a parking infraction or any fine,
penalty, fee or cost arising out of the parking infraction under this chapter
if either of the following applies:
(1)   The owner answers the charge of the parking infraction under Section
353.05 or
353.06 and in such answer denies that he or she committed the infraction and
requests a hearing concerning the infraction.  Further, the owner additionally
asserts, and provides reasonable evidence at the time to prove, that the
vehicle at the time of the commission of the parking infraction was used by the
operator without the owner’s express or implied consent, and the Parking
Violations Bureau determines that the vehicle was being so used.  If the Bureau
does not so determine, it shall conduct the hearing concerning the infraction
according to Section
353.07.
      (2)   The owner answers the charge of the parking infraction under
Section
353.05 or
353.06 and in such answer denies that he or she committed the parking
infraction; the owner submits evidence at the time that proves that, at the
time of the alleged commission of the infraction, the owner was either engaged
in the licensed taxicab business or otherwise engaged in the business of
renting or leasing vehicles under written rental or lease agreements; and the
owner submits evidence that proves that, at the time of the alleged commission
of the parking infraction, the vehicle in question was in the care, custody or
control of a person other than the owner, either pursuant to an employment
relationship, if the owner was engaged in the licensed taxicab business, or
pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement.  If the owner does not so
prove, the Parking Violations Bureau shall conduct a hearing relative to the
infraction according to Section
353.07.
   (b)   An owner of a vehicle who is either engaged in the licensed taxicab
business or otherwise engaged in the business of renting or leasing vehicles
under written rental or lease agreements, but who does not satisfy the
additional requirement of subdivision (a)(2) of this section, is not liable for
any penalties arising out of a parking infraction involving the vehicle, if at
the time of the commission of the parking infraction, the vehicle was in the
care, custody or control of a person other than the owner, either pursuant to
an employment relationship; if the owner was engaged in the licensed taxicab
business, or otherwise pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement; and if
the owner answers the charge of the parking infraction by denying that he or

101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.    (ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
 
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
 
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
 
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
 
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.  (ORC
2901.24)
501.13  CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.01)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
      A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
      B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
      C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
      D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for

533.01  DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another.  Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if
such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or
gratifying either person.
   (c)   "Sexual activity" means sexual conduct or sexual contact, or both.
   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
sexual activity, masturbation, sexual excitement or nudity in a way which tends
to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite;
      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which
inspires disgust or revulsion in persons with ordinary sensibilities, without
serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to
prurient or scatological interest, when the appeal to such interest is
primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than
primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.
   (g)   "Sexual excitement" means the condition of human male or female
genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.
   (h)   "Nudity" means the showing, representation or depiction of human male
or female genitals, pubic area or buttocks with less than a full, opaque

seller or an agent or employee of a seller from exercising reasonable diligence
to determine, the following:

541.01  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
 
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
 
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.  (ORC 2909.11)
541.02  ARSON.
   (a)   No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly cause or
create a substantial risk of physical harm to any property of another without
the other person’s consent.
   (b)   (1)   No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly cause
or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that
is not an occupied structure;
      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law. 
(ORC 2909.03)
541.03  CRIMINAL DAMAGING OR ENDANGERING.
   (a)   No person shall cause, or create a substantial risk of physical harm
to any property of another without the other person’s consent:
      (1)   Knowingly, by any means;
      (2)   Recklessly, by means of fire, explosion, flood, poison gas, poison,
radioactive material, caustic or corrosive material, or other inherently
dangerous agency or substance.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of criminal damaging or
endangering, a misdemeanor of the second degree.  If violation of this section
creates a risk of physical harm to any person, criminal damaging or endangering
is a misdemeanor of the first degree.  If the property involved in a violation
is an aircraft, an aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part, or any
other equipment or implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an
aircraft and if the violation creates a risk of physical harm to any person or
if the property involved in a violation is an occupied aircraft, crimimal
damaging or endangering is a felony and shall be prosecuted under appropriate
State law.

545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or

a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series. 
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

717.07  DISCRIMINATORY CONDUCT ADMINISTRATOR.
   The City of Medina Director of Law, and/or their designee within the Law
Department, (for purposes of this chapter, (the "Administrator") shall serve as
the City employee designated to receive "Complaints" (as defined in Section
717.08 of this chapter) including conducting investigations, scheduling

enforcement of this chapter, including by taking any actions authorized by
Section

(Ord. 112-19.  Passed 7-8-19.)
717.08  COMPLAINT AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES.
   (a)     Complaints.
      (1)     Whenever it is alleged in writing and under oath or affirmation
by a person, referred to in  this chapter as the "Complainant", that any
person, employer, employment agency, and/or labor organization, referred to in
this chapter as the "Respondent", has engaged or is engaging in any unlawful
discriminatory practice or act as defined in this chapter (the "Complaint"),
the Administrator shall determine, no later than forty (40) business days of
receipt of the Complaint, whether a Complaint of discrimination alleges a
violation based on gender identity or expression, or sexual orientation with
sufficient clarity for the matter to be investigated, mediated, and, when
appropriate, enforced under the procedures in this chapter.
      (2)     Complaints of discrimination alleging a violation of this chapter
based on sexual orientation or gender identity or expression, along with an
allegation of discrimination because of the Complainant's status in a different
legally-protected class (a "Hybrid Complaint") may be subject to deferral to
the Ohio Civil Rights Commission ("OCRC") and/or the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity ("FHEO")
or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") as set forth in this
section.
         A.     The Administrator shall notify a Complainant of the potential
additional rights and remedies available by filing a Hybrid Complaint with the
OCRC, FHEO or EEOC and that by failing to file with those state and federal
authorities, the Complainant may forego their right to do so in the future.
Such notification shall be in writing and by certified mail within ten (10)
business days of the Administrator's decision to refer the Complaint to the
OCRC, FHEO or EEOC.
         B.     In the event a Complainant declines, in writing, to file a
charge with OCRC, FHEO or EEOC, the Administrator may oversee investigation
into and/or mediation of the complaint in accordance with this chapter. In the
event a Complainant elects to file a charge with OCRC, FHEO or EEOC, the
Administrator shall not hear the Hybrid Complaint while the matter remains
pending at the state or federal level unless and until such charge, in its
entirety, reaches a final disposition; provided, however, nothing in this
division B prohibits a Complainant from filing a separate Complaint as provided
in division (a)(3) of this section. 
      (3)     Complaints of discrimination alleging a violation of this chapter
shall be overseen by the Administrator in accordance with this chapter without
deferral of the Complaint to the OCRC, FHEO, or EEOC unless and until state or
federal law is revised to grant the OCRC, FHEO, or EEOC jurisdiction to
adjudicate allegations of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation
and/or gender identity or expression, at which time such Complaints may be
subject to deferral to those state and federal agencies.  A Complaint that
fails to properly allege a violation of this chapter may be dismissed by the
Administrator at any time.
   (b)   Deadline for Filing.    A Complaint alleging discrimination under this
chapter shall be filed with the Administrator within one hundred twenty (120)
days after the alleged unlawful discriminatory practice(s) or act(s) is
committed, or within one (1) year after the Complainant discovered or by
reasonable diligence should have known of such practice(s) or act(s). The
Complaint shall be filed upon oath or affirmation and shall contain such
information, including the date, place and circumstances of the alleged
discriminatory practice(s) or act(s). The Administrator shall serve notice upon
the Complainant acknowledging such filing and advising the Complainant of the
time limits provided herein.
   (c)    Respondent. 
      (1)     Within twenty eight (28) days after the Administrator determines
that a Complaint of discrimination alleges a violation based on gender identity
or expression, or sexual orientation with sufficient clarity for the matter to
be investigated, mediated, and enforced under the procedures in this chapter,
the Administrator shall serve a copy of the Complaint and a written notice upon
the Respondent identifying the alleged discriminatory practice(s) and setting
forth the rights and obligations of the parties under this chapter.  Such
service shall be by certified mail return receipt requested.
      (2)     A person who is not named as a Respondent in a Complaint, but who
is identified as a Respondent in the course of an investigation, may be joined
as an additional or substitute Respondent upon written notice to such person
from the Administrator.  Notice shall be served upon such additional or
substitute Respondent(s) within twenty (20) days of such joinder or
substitution and shall explain the basis for the Administrator's belief that
the person to whom the notice is addressed is properly joined as a Respondent.
      (3)     The Respondent may file a Response to the Complaint with the
Administrator by regular U.S. Mail, hand delivery, or electronic mail no later
than thirty (30) days after service of the Complaint.
      (4)     The Respondent's Response shall be served by the Administrator
upon the Complainant by regular U.S. Mail or electronic mail within fourteen
(14) days of receipt by the Administrator. 
   (d)   Investigations.
      (1)     The Administrator may investigate the allegations in the
Complaint or cause the City to enter into a contract with a third party to
conduct all necessary investigations into the allegations made in a Complaint
and any facts or issues raised in Respondent's Response to a Complaint.  An
investigation may include, but is not limited to, the following: reading of any
and all submitted materials including the Complaint and response, questioning
of all Parties and any witness(es), speaking with identified third parties
(e.g., employers, co-workers, co-tenants, neighbors), seeking document(s)
relevant to the Complaint and the Response, etc.
      (2)     Upon completion of any third-party investigation, the
Administrator shall require the third party to prepare a written report and
submit other evidentiary materials detailing the findings of the investigation.
      (3)     Upon completion of any investigation, the Administrator shall
review the facts and any investigatory report(s) and underlying materials and
shall endeavor to schedule a mediation between the Complainant and the
Respondent before a neutral third-party mediator. Written notification of the
mediation shall be served upon the Complainant and Respondent by certified mail
return receipt requested or electronic mail.
   (e)     Mediation. The Administrator shall endeavor to resolve the
Complainant's allegations with a mutually agreed upon mediator who shall be a
neutral person who is an attorney licensed to practice in Ohio and with
mediation experience and discrimination representation experience. If the
parties to the mediation cannot agree on a mediator, the Administrator shall
choose the mediator.
      (1)     Nothing said or done in the course of a mediation shall be
disclosed or used as evidence in any subsequent proceeding or civil action.
      (2)     Mediation shall be completed within one hundred twenty (120) days
of the filing of the Complaint and shall toll or suspend all other dates and
deadlines under this chapter.  If mediation fails, the Administrator shall
review the facts of the Complaint, and any investigatory report(s) and
underlying materials to determine if there has been a violation of this
chapter.  If the Administrator determines a violation has occurred, the
Administrator may bring an action to enforce the provisions of this chapter and
seek relief on behalf of the City as authorized in Section
717.08 (f)(1)and (2) and Section
717.10 of this chapter. 
      (3)     An agreement between the parties arising out of such mediation
shall be reduced to a written agreement executed by the Respondent and the
Complainant and by the Administrator on behalf of the City of Medina.  The City
of Medina shall have an interest in the mediation agreement related to
enforcement of the purposes and enforcement of this chapter.
      (4)     The Administrator may impose civil penalties for a violation or
breach of a mediation agreement. 
   (f)     Penalties.
      (1)     The Administrator may impose civil penalties and may issue a
cease and desist order for a Complainant's or Respondent's failure to appear at
an agreed upon mediation, for a violation or breach of a mediation agreement,
and/or for any other violation of this chapter in the following amounts:
         A.     Five hundred dollars ($500) for a Complainant's or Respondent's
failure to appear at an agreed upon mediation without a showing of good cause,
or Complainant's or Respondent's first breach of a mediation agreement, or any
other violation of this chapter, as determined by the Administrator
         B.     One thousand dollars ($1,000) for a Complainant's or
Respondent's second breach of a mediation agreement or a second violation of
any other provision of this chapter, as determined by the Administrator.
         C.     One thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) for a Complainant's
or Respondent's third or any subsequent breaches of a mediation agreement, or a
third or subsequent violation of any other provision of this chapter, as
determined by the Administrator.
      (2)     Upon the failure or refusal of a person to pay the foregoing
civil penalties, a civil penalty may be enforced and collected through a civil
action brought in the Medina Municipal Court and the court costs shall be
charged to the defending party.  The civil fines shall be used to offset the
costs of administering this chapter.
      (3)     If the Complainant fails to appear at an agreed upon mediation
without a showing of good cause, the Complaint may be dismissed at the
discretion of the Administrator.
      (4)     A civil penalty for the filing of a False Complaint under Section
717.09(b) of this chapter may be enforced and collected through a civil action
brought in the Medina Municipal Court and the court costs shall be charged to
the defending party. The civil penalties for the filing of a False Complaint
may be imposed on a Complainant as follows:
         A.     Five hundred dollars ($500) for the filing of the first False
Complaint.
         B.     One thousand dollars ($1,000) for the filing of a second False

         C.     One thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) for the filing of a
third and any subsequent False Complaint.
            (Ord. 112-19.  Passed 7-8-19.)
717.09  DISMISSAL OF COMPLAINTS. 
   (a)     Where mediation is unsuccessful, the Administrator shall then review
the facts related to the Complaint and the Response and any investigatory
report(s) and underlying materials to determine if there has been a violation
of this chapter. Where the Administrator determines a violation has occurred,
the Administrator shall proceed to enforce this chapter as described in
Sections
717.08 (f)(4) and
717.10 of this chapter. Where the Administrator determines that no violation
under this chapter has occurred, the Administrator shall dismiss the Complaint
upon the Administrator's written findings.  The Administrator shall promptly
serve notice upon the Complainant, Respondent, and any necessary party of any
dismissal pursuant to this section.
   (b)     No person shall knowingly file a Complaint including false or
fraudulent information, submitted in bad faith with the intent to defame or to
cause other reputational or material harm to an individual, entity or
organization (for purposes of this chapter, a "False Complaint"). A
determination or finding by the Administrator that a Complaint is
unsubstantiated is, alone, insufficient to prove the existence of a False
complaint. Upon written  findings by the Administrator that a Complainant has
filed a False Complaint, the Administrator may impose a civil penalty on the
Complainant, as referenced in Section
717.08 (f)(4) of this chapter.  (Ord. 112-19.  Passed 7-8-19.)
717.10  JUDICIAL RELIEF. 
   (a)     If any attempt at mediation under this chapter fails or is otherwise
unsuccessful, and the Administrator then determines that a Respondent or
Complainant has violated this chapter by engaging in conduct prohibited by this
chapter or by filing a False Complaint, the Administrator may, in the
Administrator's capacity as the Director of Law for the City of Medina, enforce
this chapter by initiating an action in the Medina Municipal Court  to collect
an unpaid monetary civil penalty as specified in Section
717.08(f) of this chapter.
   (b)     If any Complainant or Respondent violates any term of a mediation
agreement, the Administrator, in the Administrator's capacity as the Director
of Law for the City of Medina, may bring an action in the name of the City of
Medina for a breach of the mediation agreement and /or specific performance of
the mediation agreement in either the Medina Municipal Court or the Medina
County Court of Common Pleas, as the Administrator deems to be appropriate. 
   (c)     If a Respondent or a Complainant continues to violate the provisions
of this chapter after a civil fine has been imposed on that person, the
Administrator, in the Administrator's capacity as the Director of Law for the
City of Medina, may bring an injunction action in the name of the City of
Medina in the Medina County Common Pleas Court against the violator to seek an
order from the court to stop the violation or to otherwise compel compliance
with this chapter and may bring any other legal or equitable court action as is
provided by law.  (Ord. 112-19.  Passed 7-8-19.)
717.11  NON-EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES.
   Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent any person from exercising
any right or seeking any remedy to which they might otherwise be entitled under
any other law, regulation, or policy.  The remedies provided for in this
chapter are in addition to, and not in lieu of, other remedies.  A person's
decision to seek remedies provided for in this chapter shall not toll any
statute of limitations which may apply to any claim, charge, or complaint.
(Ord. 112-19.  Passed 7-8-19.)
717.12  SEVERABILITY.
   This chapter and each section and division thereof are hereby declared to be
independent provisions, sections, and divisions, notwithstanding any other
evidence of legislative intent, and it is hereby declared to be the controlling
legislative intent that if any provisions of this chapter, its sections and the
divisions thereof, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is
held to be invalid, the remaining sections and divisions of each section in
this chapter shall not be affected thereby. It is hereby declared that such
sections and divisions of this chapter would have been passed independently of
such section or division that is held to be invalid.  (Ord. 112-19.  Passed 7-

hereof.  The City Forester shall list the replacement standards on the permit. 
As many trees of equivalent value shall be replaced.
   (b)   Any tree removed without a permit must be replaced with as many trees
of equivalent value (not necessarily the same species).  All replacement trees
shall be a minimum 1 ¾" caliper and shall be no more than 10" caliper unless an
approved plan by the City Forester indicates otherwise.  All replacement trees
shall be of a species listed in the master street tree plan, or approved by the
City Forester, and in conformance with ANSI Z60.1, nursery stock standards.
   (c)   Where the replacement of trees is not feasible or possible and/or not
applicable, the equivalent value of the trees, as well as projected costs for
installation and maintenance, will be assessed. All fees collected will be
placed in the Shade Tree Trust account.
   (d)   The cost replacement formula shall be a fee of thirty-five dollars
($35.00) for every inch of trunk (measured in circumference) that was damaged
and/or removed.  To determine the circumference of the trunk, measure at a
height of two feet (2') above grade.  The measured circumference of the trunk
in inches shall be equivalent to the dollar amount of the damages collected
times thirty-five dollars ($35.00). Example:  a tree measures six inches (6")
in circumference equals six inches (6") (of trunk) x $35.00 = $210.00 in fees
collected.

in question, until the appeal process is completed.  (Ord. 50-04.  Passed 4-12-
04.)
907.99  PENALTY.
   Any person who violates, neglects, or refuses to comply with or assists in
the violation of any provisions of this Chapter, or any order, permit, or
notice issued pursuant thereto, shall be fined not more than one hundred
dollars ($100.00) for each such violation.  Each day any such violation
continues shall constitute a separate offense, and each tree removed or damaged
shall also constitute a separate offense.  Additionally, any person who harms,
damages, or removes a public or protected tree will be charged according to the
cost replacement formula set forth in Section

of runoff from an undeveloped property and that of a typical single family
residence, under typical hydrologic conditions.
   (c)   For all residential and nonresidential properties, that is enterprise,
business establishment, building, or other occupancy not covered by subsections
(a) and (b) of this section, the rate shall be computed based on the total

943.12  INDIGENT BURIAL POLICY.
   (a)   Purpose.  This indigent burial policy is enacted to comply with the
provisions of Ohio R.C. 9.15 pertaining to the burial of indigent persons found
within the City who are not claimed by any person for private interment or
cremation at the person's own expense, or interment or cremation when the body
of an indigent person is claimed by an indigent person.  The purpose of this
policy is to provide for the burial of indigents, or the burial of an indigent
person claimed by an indigent person, for reasons of public health and
sensibilities. 
   (b)   Application of Policy.
      (1)   When the body of a dead person is found within the City and such
person was not an inmate of a correctional, benevolent, or charitable
institution of this State; and the body is not claimed by any person for
private interment or cremation at the person's own expense; or delivered for
the purpose of medical or surgical study or dissection in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 1713.34, the City shall be liable for the cremation and interment
expenses, in the amounts set forth herein, if:
         A.   The deceased is determined to be an indigent person; and
         B.   The person was a legal resident of the City of Medina at the time
of death.
      (2)   When the body is claimed by an indigent person simply as that of a
loved one, without undertaking to arrange and pay for private interment, the
City shall be liable for the cremation or interment expenses, in the amounts
set forth herein, if:
         A.   The deceased is determined to be an indigent person; and
         B.   The person was a legal resident of the City of Medina at the time
of death; and
         C.   The claimant is determined to be an indigent person.
   (c)   Administration.  The Service Director is hereby appointed as the
proper officer of the City, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 9.15, to be
responsible for the administration of this indigent burial policy.  If the
next-of-kin of the deceased are not available or are unknown, the Service
Director shall have the authority to sign all documents necessary for the
cremation. 
   (d)   Determining Indigence.
      (1)   Prior to the cremation authorization, the Service Director shall
make reasonable attempt to determine whether the deceased person is in fact
indigent and, where the deceased person is claimed by an indigent person,
whether the claimant is in fact indigent. 
      (2)   "Indigent decedent" means a person who dies without leaving an
ascertainable estate sufficient to pay part or all of the person's burial
expenses and whose burial expenses are not payable by the State or County
Veteran's Administration.  The estate of the decedent shall include, but is not
limited to, the ready availability of real or personal property owned;
employment benefits; pensions; annuities; social security; unemployment
compensation, inheritances; number and age of dependents; outstanding debts,
obligations and liabilities; and any other relevant considerations concerning
the financial condition of the individual.
      (3)   The term "indigent claimant" encompasses individuals who are poor,
needy, destitute, or in poverty.  The criteria for determining whether an
individual is indigent include the ready availability of real or personal
property owned; employment benefits; pensions; annuities; social security;
unemployment compensation, inheritances; number and age of dependents;
outstanding debts, obligations and liabilities; and any other relevant
considerations concerning the financial condition of the individual.
   (e)   Determining Legal Residency.
      (1)   Prior to the cremation authorization, the Service Director shall
make reasonable attempt to determine whether the deceased person was a legal
resident of the City.
      (2)   "Legal Residency" means a physical presence in a particular
location, coupled with the present intent to make that place a permanent
residence for a period of time. 
      (3)   In cases where the decedent was living in a nursing home or
hospital located within the City, legal residency shall mean intent to make the
nursing home or hospital a permanent residence.
   (f)   Policy.
      (1)   Upon finding that the deceased was a legal resident of the City and
an indigent person, and where the deceased person is claimed by an indigent
person, that the claimant is indigent, the Service Director shall authorize the
funeral director or other party to cremate the decedent.
      (2)   The City shall dispose of the remains of indigent persons by
cremation only.  The City shall pay a maximum of seven hundred and fifty
dollars ($750.00) for the cremation and interment of the remains of the
deceased.  Said services shall include transportation of the deceased to the
funeral home, necessary supplies and procedures, and provide a temporary urn
for the storage of the deceased's cremated remains.  The Finance Director is
hereby authorized to pay such expenses, upon certification from the Service
Director and receipt of an invoice or bill from the funeral director. 
      (3)   The cremated remains of the deceased may be released to the
decedent's family. If the cremated remains are not claimed, the City may cause
the remains to be buried, and the Finance Director is hereby authorized to pay
such expenses, upon certification by the Service Director and receipt of an
invoice or bill for the burial.
      (4)   The City shall also provide at the grave of the person's cremated
remains, if such remains are buried, a stone or concrete marker on which the
person's name and age, if known, and date of death shall be inscribed. 
   (g)   Limitations.
      (1)   If the body of an indigent person is claimed by relatives or
friends who arrange for the funeral according to their wishes, the City shall
not pay all or any part of the expenses for the same. 
      (2)   The City's Indigent Burial Policy is not supplemental.  The funeral
director or funeral home personnel shall not ask for nor accept any funds above
the amounts set forth herein.  Upon completion of the cremation, the funeral
director shall submit an itemized bill to the Service Director containing the
following information:
         A.   Name and age of the deceased;
         B.   Place of burial;
         C.   Services performed;
         D.   Total costs of services;
         E.   Amount received from other sources; and
         F.   Amount due from the City.
      (3)   The funeral director or funeral home shall reduce the cost to the
City by the amount of funds received from any other source.  If additional
funds are paid to the funeral director or funeral home after the City has paid
as herein provided, the City shall be refunded the exact amount of the
additional funds paid to the funeral director or funeral home within thirty
(30) days of the receipt thereof.  The funeral director shall submit a
notarized statement to the Service Director indicating his understanding and
compliance with the provisions of this Policy.
      (4)   In the event that it is found after the cremation of the deceased
and payment of the cremation and/or burial expenses by the City, that such
indigent decedent and/or indigent claimant had means, assets, insurance or
other benefits or allowances available for the payment of all or part of such
expenses, such proceedings may be taken to recover such costs and expenses as
may be authorized by law.

(4)   A statement supporting the proposed amendment.
(c)   Review and Action by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission

(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1107.08  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Intent.  The purpose of this Section is to provide guidelines and
standards to be followed by the Board in considering requests for variances and
appeals, where the jurisdiction of the Board has been established by the City
Charter and by this Ordinance.
   (b)   Purpose of Variances and Appeals.
(1)   Appeals. Generally, an appeal may be taken to the Board by a person, or
by any office, department, board, or bureau aggrieved by a decision of any
administrative or enforcement official or body charged with enforcement of this
Ordinance.  An appeal must be filed within fourteen (14) days of issuance of
the applicable written decision, and such appeal shall be made on forms made
available by the Planning Director.
(2)   Variances.  Where there are "practical difficulties" (for area or size-
type variances) or "unnecessary hardships" (for use variances) preventing a
property owner from conforming with the strict letter of this Ordinance, the
Board shall have the power to authorize variances from the standards in this
Ordinance, with such conditions and safeguards as it may determine to be
necessary so that the spirit of this Ordinance is observed, public safety
secured, and substantial justice done.
   (c)   Stay of Proceedings.  An appeal to the Board shall stay enforcement
proceedings in furtherance of the appealed action, unless the Planning Director
certifies to the Board that by reason of the facts stated in the appeal, a stay
would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case proceedings shall
not be stayed other than by an injunction granted by the Court of Common
Pleas.  A stay of proceedings shall not stay the City's authority to issue a
stop work order on a project that may be in progress and being performed in a
manner that is not in conformance with applicable ordinances and regulations. 
Also, it shall not stay a project when the appeal is brought by a third-party
contesting the issuance of a permit.
   (d)   Application to the Board.  Variances and appeals for which Board
action is sought shall be commenced by a person filing an application to the
Board on forms as specified by the Planning Director and accompanied by
required fees.  Each application shall be accompanied by the payment of the fee
established in Chapter
1108 of the Planning and Zoning Code.  In addition, the Board, where
appropriate, may refer an application to qualified consultants for a report if
it deems the proposed use may require special study.  The cost of such report
shall be at the expense of the applicant, in accordance with a policy
established and amended from time to time by Council. 
   The application shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal is based and
shall contain a notarized signature of the property owner or owner's agent. 
Applications involving a request for a variance shall specify the section
number(s) containing the standards from which a variance is sought and the
nature and extent of such variance.
   (e)   Review by the Board.  The Planning Director shall forward the
application, along with any supporting materials and plans to the Board. 
Notice of the hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation
in the City at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the hearing, and sent
by mail or personal delivery to the owners of property for which a variance
request is being considered, and to all owners of property adjacent to and
directly across the street from the property in question.  At the hearing, a
party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney.
   (f)   Decision by the Board.  The concurring vote of three (3) members of
the Board shall be necessary to reverse an order, requirement, decision, or
determination of the Planning Director, or to decide in favor of the applicant
any matter upon which they are required to pass judgment. The Board may reverse
or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or
determination, in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein.  To that
end, the Board shall have all the powers of the officer or body from whom the
appeal was taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit.  With an
affirmative decision, the Board may impose conditions.  The decision of the
Board shall be final, but the City, with approval by the Council, or any person
having an interest affected by a decision of the Board, may appeal to the Court
of Common Pleas, and to any Court of final jurisdiction.
   (g)   Record of Decision and Order.  The Board shall prepare and retain a
record of each appeal, and shall base its decision on this record.  This record
shall include:
(1)   The relevant administrative records and the administrative orders issued
thereon relating to the appeal.
(2)   The notice of the appeal.
(3)   Such documents, exhibits, plans, photographs, or written reports as may
be submitted to the Board for its consideration.
   The written findings of fact, the decisions, and the conditions imposed by
the Board in acting on the appeal shall be entered into the official record,
after being signed by the Secretary of the Board.  The final appealable
decision or order of the Board shall be effective upon the written notice of
the Board's decision or order is delivered to the applicant or appellant.
   (h)   Approval Period.  If construction has not commenced within twelve (12)
months after the Board grants a variance to permit the erection or alteration
of a building or structure and completed within two (2) years of the Board
approval date, then the variance becomes null and void.
   (i)   Standards for Variances and Appeals.  Variances and appeals shall be
granted only in accordance with, and based on, the findings set forth in this
Section.  The burden of proof for variances and appeals shall be upon the
applicant.  The extent to which the following factors, standards, and criteria
apply to a specific case shall be determined by the Board.
(1)   Factors applicable to area or size-type variances ("practical
difficulty"). The applicant shall show by a preponderance of the evidence that
the variance is justified, as determined by the Board.  The Board shall weigh
the following factors to determine whether a practical difficulty exists and an
area or size-type variance should be granted:
A.   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or whether
there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
B.   Whether the variance is substantial;
C.   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be substantially
altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial detriment as a
result of the variance;
D.   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of governmental
services (e.g., water, sewer, garbage);
E.   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of the
zoning restrictions;
F.   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated through
some method other than a variance; and/or
G.   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would be
observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance.
(2)   Standards applicable to use variances ("unnecessary hardships").  The
applicant shall demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that all of the
following standards have been met in order to find an unnecessary hardship
exists so as to justify the granting of a use variance, as determined by the
Board:
A.   The variance requested stems from a condition which is unique to the
property at issue and not ordinarily found in the same zone or district;
B.   The hardship condition is not created by actions of the applicant;
C.   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the rights of
adjacent owners;
D.   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the public health,
safety or general welfare;
E.   The variance will be consistent with the general spirit and intent of this
Ordinance;
F.   The variance sought is the minimum which will afford relief to the
applicant; and
G.   There is no other economically viable use which is permitted in the zoning
district.
(3)   Factors applicable to sign variances ("practical difficulty").  The
applicant shall show by a preponderance of the evidence that the variance is
justified, as determined by the Board.  The Board shall weigh the following
factors to determine whether a practical difficulty exists and a sign variance
should be granted:
A.   Construction of a conforming sign would obstruct the vision of motorists
or otherwise endanger public health or safety;
B.   A conforming sign would be blocked from the sight of passing motorists due
to existing buildings, trees or other obstructions;
C.   Construction of a conforming sign would require removal or severe
alteration to significant features on the site, such as removal of trees,
alteration of the natural topography, obstruction of a natural drainage course,
or alteration or demolition of significant historical features or site
amenities;
D.   A sign that exceeds the allowable height or area standards of this
Ordinance would be more appropriate in scale because of the large size or
frontage of the premises or building;
E.   The exception shall not adversely impact the character or appearance of
the building or lot or the neighborhood; 
F.   The variance sought is the minimum necessary to allow reasonable use,
visibility, or readability of the sign; and/or
G.   The variance will be consistent with the general spirit and intent of this
Ordinance.
(4)   Criteria applicable to appeals.  The Board shall reverse an order of a
zoning official only if it finds that the action or decision appealed:
A.   Was arbitrary or capricious; or
B.   Was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact; or
C.   Was based on erroneous interpretation of this Ordinance or zoning law; or
D.   Constituted an abuse of discretion.

pay the costs of review of applications for appeals, interpretations,

(2)   Special meetings;
(3)   Review by City Law Director and/or any City consulting attorney and

and/or installation of subdivision improvements; and
(14)   Similar services and expenses.
   (b)   Escrow Requirement.  If the Planning Director determines that the
application is one for which such costs for review are likely to be incurred,
the Planning Director shall require the applicant to pay into escrow, in
advance, an amount estimated to be sufficient to cover the expected costs.  The
amount to be paid into escrow shall be established in increments of at least
five hundred dollars ($500.00), commencing with an initial deposit of not less
than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).  No application shall be processed prior
to the required escrow mount having been deposited with the Planning Director. 
If an applicant objects to the amount of the escrow funds required to be
deposited, it may appeal that determination to the Council within thirty (30) 
days after the initial decision by the Planning Director.
   (c)   Minimum Balance.  If funds in the escrow account are depleted or fall
below twenty percent (20%) of the initial escrow amount, the applicant shall
make an application deposit sufficient to cover any deficit and to re-establish

the initial escrow amount, whichever is greater.  The amount of additional
deposit sufficient to cover any deficit in the account shall be at least five
hundred dollars ($500.00) or such greater amount as is determined by the
Planning Director to be reasonably necessary in order to cover anticipated
remaining or future expenses.  No further action shall be taken on an
application, and no application shall be placed on or allowed to remain on a
meeting agenda, until the escrow account has been re-established to such
appropriate level.
   (d)   Accurate Records.  The Planning Director shall maintain accurate

escrow account.  Such escrow funds (from one or more applicants) shall be kept
in a separate bank account or bank account category, as determined to be
appropriate by the Finance Director.
   (e)   Balance Refund.  Any excess funds remaining in the escrow account
after the application has been fully processed, reviewed, and the final
decision has been rendered regarding the project will be refunded to the
applicant with no interest to be paid on those funds.  If the balance of the
expenses for the application for any reason exceeds the amount remaining in
escrow following final action by the City, the City shall send the applicant a
statement for such additional fees.  Until the applicant pays such fees for the
expenses of review, no further permit or certificate of occupancy or other
permit for the project shall be issued, and if such expenses remain unpaid for
a period of fourteen (14) days, the Planning Director may issue appropriate
stop work orders or take other action to halt work on the project.  In
addition, the City may take legal action to collect unpaid fees.
   (f)   Applicant Agreement.  The application for zoning approval or other
approvals covered in this chapter shall indicate that the applicant agrees to
pay the City's expenses for review of the application and other above-stated
expenses, as provided for on Exhibit "A" CITY OF MEDINA ESCROW RESOLUTION

1109.04  DESIGN REVIEW GUIDELINES.
   (a)   Purpose. The appearance of buildings, structures, open spaces and
landscape throughout the City is of public concern.  It is in the public
interest to ensure that new developments and modifications to existing
developments reflect and are sensitive to the history, architecture, community
character and other building traditions of the City of Medina.  Therefore, the
purpose of the regulations in this section is to provide criteria to be used by
the City Planning Commission when evaluating the appropriateness of proposed
development and redevelopment in the City.
   These provisions are established to achieve, among others, the following
purposes:
(1)   Strengthen, protect, enhance and improve the existing visual and
aesthetic character of the City, and to prevent the creation or perpetuation of
nuisances or blight in the City.
(2)   To integrate developments into the surrounding environment, as well as to
ensure that each new development and redevelopment will be attractive.
(3)   To protect and improve property values.
(4)   To foster and encourage creative application of design principles.
(5)   To ensure that the particular existing design features, which contribute
to the unique character of Medina, are retained and re-created in a manner that
retains and enhances the City's sense of community.
(6)   To ensure that new development and redevelopment are compatible and
harmonious with the existing overall character of the City, especially when
development is proposed in areas where the existing structures do not have
architectural features that warrant replication or enhancement.
(7)   To bring new buildings into an orderly arrangement with landscape and
nature, other buildings, and open space areas.
(8)   To ensure that these objectives are achieved through an impartial review
process which assures that each proposal complies with these guidelines.
   (b)   Explanation of Terms.  For the purpose of and use in this chapter,
certain terms and words shall be interpreted with regard to the following
explanations:
(1)   Appropriateness.  A proposal is judged to be appropriate when it respects
the existing style of a building and fits comfortably within its setting,
neighborhood and overall community.  This condition applies to landscaping and
accessory structures as well.
(2)   Compatibility.  A design or a material/color selection is compatible when
it does not strongly deviate from its parent building or the overall character
of the neighborhood.  To be compatible does not require look-alike designs, but
rather designs that reflect some aspects of its parent building or buildings in
the general vicinity, such as scale of windows, overhangs, building materials,
patterns of siding, roof slope.  Conversely, incompatibility occurs when an
architectural design, landscape design or accessory building proposal is
aesthetically harsh or overwhelming relative to its neighbors.
(3)   Noncontributing.  A factor in a proposal or part thereof that is taken
from an existing building characteristic or site feature such as design, scale,
fenestration, architectural feature, material or color that is determined by
the Planning Commission to be not appropriate for replication in new projects
or modifications to existing projects when:
A.   It does not enhance or improve the character of the City and/or the
surrounding environs of the project, or
B.   It is unrepresentative of the overall character of the City and/or the
prevalent character of the surrounding environs of the project.
(4)   Proportion.  The relationship of parts of a building, landscape,
structures, or buildings to each other and to the whole balance.
(5)   Proximity.  Proximity shall be considered in terms of the potential for
one property, by virtue of its location, to materially affect other
properties.  In determining a property to be in proximity to another, the
following factors shall be considered:
A.   The visibility of both properties from a common point; or
B.   The location of both properties within a relatively compact network of
streets, walkways or spaces.
(6)   Style.  Style relates to a building's character and configuration in plan
and elevation.  It also relates to architectural conventions of a particular
time period concerning details or windows and doors, eaves, corner boards,
pitch of roofs, and the materials of the building's skin.
   (c)   Design Review Guidelines.  The following standards shall apply to the
design and appearance of all new construction or building renovation (other
than for single family residential structures).  As a consideration, during any
plan review, the Planning Commission shall determine if the proposal complies
with the following standards:
(1)   The height, width and general proportions of the structure shall
complement adjacent buildings so that an overall harmonious appearance is
created and maintained.
(2)   The architecture of a commercial building should not act as a
recognizable logo for a national corporation or franchise. The building
architecture is deemed to be a "logo" when the specific business occupying the
proposed building could still be easily identified if all the allowable signs
were to be removed
(3)   Architectural details and ornamentation shall be meaningful to the
overall design and appropriate for the size and scale of proposed structures,
and harmonious with other architectural details and ornamentation on adjacent
structures.
(4)   Blank walls (without openings) shall not be permitted on public faces of
any building.
(5)   The use of long unbroken building facades shall be avoided. Front
building facades shall exhibit the use of recesses, fenestration, pilasters, or
other architectural features deemed appropriate to provide character.
(6)   The front door or main entrance to a building shall be visible from the
street. An entrance to a public building shall be clear and visible and not
obscured by building masses.
(7)   Materials shall be appropriate for the structure and the use therein. 
Materials shall be weather-resistant.  The materials shall be compatible with
and not in stark contrast to the materials used on adjacent structures.
(8)   Colors and textures shall be appropriate for the size and scale of the
proposed structure and shall be harmonious with adjacent structures. Building
colors shall consist of earth-tones.  Bright, chromatic, colors are
discouraged.
(9)   The materials, colors, and finishes used for screening roof top
mechanical equipment and other surface equipment shall be consistent with the
primary structure and, to the extent practicable; such screening shall be
designed as an integral part of the architecture of the building.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
(10)   The following styles and materials are inappropriate and shall be
discouraged from use:
A.   Mansard roofs for one-story structures in an area that is residential in
character,
B.   Pre-engineered metal buildings and  "pole buildings",
C.   Exposed concrete or cinder block on the front or sides of any building
(except split face, ½ high or other special "architecturally patterned" block),
D.   Stucco appearance, unless it is utilized with bands of accent color,
recessed or protruding belt courses, wide reveals, or combinations thereof,
E.   Sheet metal siding, except as rain gutter/downspouts; exposed unstained
wood; exposed steel nails; vinyl siding; and flimsy vertical wood siding (e.g.,
T-111),
F.   Bright or primary colors, and/or awnings which are in stark contrast to
other structures in the surrounding area and/or the design of the proposed
structure.
(Ord. 58-17.  Passed 4-24-17.)
(11)   Roof materials should be asphalt, fiberglass and slate.  Clay tile and/
or ribbed metal may have merit as a variation, but will be very carefully
considered in contrast to adjacent materials.
(12)   Landscaping shall be designed to:
A.   Maintain an appropriate proportion of deciduous and non-deciduous trees.
B.   Be in such locations, scale and quantity to be integrated with the
building design.
C.   Clearly designate entrances and exits.
D.   Reasonably screen paved area from the street through the use of mounding,
the land's natural topography, and/or adequate vegetation.
(13)   Parking, to the extent feasible, shall be located behind the front wall
of the building.  Only circulation drives, when necessary, will be permitted in
front of the building.
(14)   Approaches, drives and parking areas shall be of appropriate size and
scale in relation to the appearance of the proposed development from public
rights-of-way, adjacent property and the internal portion of the site itself. 
Such appropriate scale shall be achieved by the width of approaches and drives,
by having adequate but not excessive parking, and by using landscaping within
large parking areas.  Curbing and adequate landscaping shall be provided
between driveway aprons.
(15)   Mechanical equipment, waste receptacles, and other similar appurtenant
or accessory structures shall be located to minimize the impact on the building
and the community.
(16)   Large Retail Establishment Standards shall apply to retail business
where an individual tenant, owner, occupant, or business occupies more than
10,000 square feet. Large retail establishments shall also be subject to the
following:
A.   Facades greater than 100 feet in horizontal length shall incorporate wall
plane projects or recesses having a depth of at least three percent (3%) of the
length of the façade and extending at least twenty percent (20%) of the façade.
No uninterrupted length of any façade shall exceed 100 horizontal feet. Facades
that have no customer entrance are only visible from service areas and are
screened from abutting properties and customer parking are exempt from this
requirement.
B.   Facades that face a public street shall have arcades, display windows,
entry areas, awning or other such features along no less than sixty percent
(60%) of their horizontal length.

lot.
E.   In the event of property abandonment or vacancy, maintenance of facilities
and grounds, including buildings and structures, landscaping, parking lots and
storm water runoff facilities shall be conducted.

only be required to comply with the following standards:
A.   Architectural details and ornamentation  on the street façade shall be
meaningful to the overall design and appropriate for the size and scale of
proposed structures, and harmonious with other architectural details and
ornamentation on adjacent structures
B.   Additions and accessory structures should be designed to be compatible
with the main structure.
C.   All exterior finished materials, including windows and doors, shall be of
architectural grade with long term maintenance characteristics.
   (d)   Interpretive Illustrations for Design Guidelines.  The Planning
Commission may prepare from time to time or authorize the preparation of
illustrations which demonstrate the design review criteria in this chapter. 
Such illustrations may include drawings, photographs of acceptable projects in
the City of Medina and elsewhere, drawings or photographs of projects which
have been approved pursuant to these regulations and photographs of existing
building characteristics or site features which have been determined by the
Planning Commission to be noncontributing.  Any such illustrations may be
recommended by a majority vote of the Planning Commission and approved by
Council.  When approved, such illustrations shall be considered administrative
guidelines which assist in the utilization of these design review criteria.

(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1113.06  OPEN SPACE PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Common Open Space Land.  Whenever the Comprehensive Plan shows the
location of common open space land on a lot, the City shall require the
reservation of this land as common open space land, before the applicable
zoning or building permit is issued.  Restrictions, covenants and improvement
plans providing for the reservation, development and maintenance of such land
shall be subject to Planning Commission approval.
   (b)   Public Open Space Land.  Whenever the Comprehensive Plan shows the
location of public open space land on a lot, the City shall require the
dedication of this land as public open space.  If the area of such land exceeds
1,000 square feet per dwelling unit proposed on the lot, or five percent (5%)
of the lot area if it is proposed for commercial use, the additional land shall
be reserved for one year after the date of approval by the Planning Commission
to permit its acquisition by the appropriate public body.  If no public open
space land is shown on the Comprehensive Plan, or if less than the amount
required above is shown on the Plan, the developer of residential or commercial
lands shall pay the Municipality one thousand ($1,000.00) per dwelling unit
proposed on the lot, or one thousand dollars ($1,000) per acre if the lot is
proposed for commercial use, in proportion to the amount of public open space
land not dedicated in lieu of providing public open space.
(1)   Conversions of existing residential buildings to commercial use and
public, institutional, fraternal or community service uses defined in Section
1105.76 shall be exempt from the public open space requirements of this
subsection.
(2)   Such payment shall be used as follows:
A.   To purchase or improve public open space land which will serve the
quadrant of the City in which the lot for which payment is made is located,
unless Council approves the use of such payment in a different quadrant.
B.   With Council approval, up to fifty percent (50%) of the open space land
funds received after the effective date of this subsection may be used toward
the purchase of public property.
C.   For the purpose of establishing the four (4) quadrants of the City, they
shall be defined as bounded by West Liberty-East Washington Streets and North
and South Court Streets.
(3)   Dedication.  Public open space required by subsection (B) above shall be
dedicated to the Municipality prior to the issuance of zoning certificates for
the lot.  If the public open space proposed for dedication does not have access
to a dedicated street, the developer shall provide a temporary easement from a
dedicated street to the proposed public open space.  The temporary easement
shall be vacated when the public open space is provided access from a dedicated
street.  The Planning Commission may require the temporary easement to be
improved so that it is passable.
(4)   Other Open Space Land.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Zoning Ordinance, the Planning Commission may require the reservation or
dedication of open space land not specifically shown on the Comprehensive Plan
to meet the needs created by the proposed development of a lot for schools,
parks or other neighborhood purposes.  In such cases, the Planning Commission
shall consider the topography, drainage soil conditions and the extent and
configuration of such land in relation to the Comprehensive Plan, proposed
development and surrounding area.  Before acting on such cases, the Planning
Commission shall also refer them to Council.
(5)   Improvement of Open Space Land.  Grading, drainage, seeding and other
improvements which are determined by the City Engineer to be reasonably
suitable for park and recreational uses of common open space land approved by
the Planning Commission, or public open space land accepted for dedication by
Council, shall be made by the developer.  In the case of common land the
Planning Commission may permit the developer to furnish a performance bond in
lieu of such improvements in an amount approved by the Engineer, and form
approved by the Law Director.
(6)   Exemption.  Any lot of a subdivision within which a contribution of
public land or payment in lieu thereof, has been made in accordance with the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, shall be exempt from any such further
contribution or payment.
   (Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1113.07  INFILL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (a)   Compatibility.  All new single and two family residential development
shall reflect, complement, and preserve the nature and character of existing
adjacent residential development.
   (b)   Building Placement and Mass.  All new homes shall conform in street
orientation and massing to adjacent homes.
   (c)   Harmonious Aesthetics.  The following is a list of objectives to
achieve infill development that is characteristic of the existing structures:
(1)   New infill development shall be compatible with the neighboring
structures in terms of proportion, size, mass and height.
(2)   Similar materials, colors, architectural details and roof pitch shall be
used on all sides and on all structures on the site and shall be harmonious
with adjacent properties.
(3)   The creation of a vertical canyon effect between structures shall be
minimized. For instance, when a one story structure is proposed next to a two
story structure, the space between the two buildings shall increase as wall
height increases.
   (d)    Any improvement which is determined by the Planning Director to be in
conflict with this section shall be forwarded to the Planning Commission for
review.

1114.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Special Planning District is to regulate the development
and use of property in areas of the City that contain sensitive or unique
environmental, historic, architectural, or other features which require
additional protections and flexibility not provided through the application of
the standard zoning district regulations, and to promote creative and sensitive
site planning. It is the intent of this chapter to provide for a district which
will permit a greater range or mixture of compatible uses in areas than would
be allowable in the standard zoning classifications of this Zoning Ordinance
while also requiring features that protect against negative impacts of
incompatible land uses or harm to the environment. It is the purpose of these
regulations to provide an effective method for the City to guide the
development of such areas so as to preserve such unique characteristics or to
provide for the greater range or mixture of land uses when appropriate.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1114.02  DESIGNATION.
   The Special Planning District shall be designated by the abbreviation "SPD"
followed by a number specific to the designation on the Official Zoning Map of
the City.  All property so classified is subject to the provisions of this
chapter and an adopted ordinance pursuant to this chapter.  The SPD shall
replace all underlying zoning that existed on the subject properties prior to
the approval of the SPD.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
            
1114.03  ESTABLISHMENT OF A SPECIAL PLANNING DISTRICT.
   The establishment of a Special Planning District (SPD) represents a formal
amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map. The process for establishing
an SPD and approving the Conceptual Development Plan and Guidelines shall be
the same as provided for in Section
1107.06.
(a)   In addition to the submission requirements set forth in Section
1107.06 and
1114.05, the following data shall be required to be submitted to the Planning
Director:
(1)   Present use and land subject to zone change;
(2)   Present zoning district;
(3)   Proposed use and plans including the proposed Conceptual Plan;
(4)   Proposed SPD zoning district;
(b)   All land within the SPD shall be contiguous in that it shall not be
divided into segments by (1) any limited access highway, or (2) any tract of
land not owned by the developer of the SPD.
      (Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1114.04  REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN SPD DISTRICT.
   In order for Council to adopt an SPD, it must first make written findings
that one or more of the following conditions exist, or will exist within the
proposed SPD.
(a)   A concentration of retail and service oriented commercial establishments
serving as a principal business activity center for the community.
(b)   An area recommended in the Comprehensive Plan for special zoning
regulations.
(c)   A property located in a transition area where there is a need to provide
for a greater mixture of uses than would be permitted in standard zones of this
Ordinance.
(d)   Lands which permit for ingenuity, imagination and design efforts on the
part of builders, architects, site planners, and developers that can produce
residential developments which are in keeping with overall land use intensity
and open space objectives while departing from the strict application of use
setback, height and minimum lot size requirements contained in this Ordinance.
(e)   Land that is occupied by substantial natural characteristics worthy of
preservation or which are historic aids to the identification of residential
communities which help residents relate to their communities and to relate the
social organization of communities to their physical environments.
      (Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1114.05  CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND GUIDELINES.
   For each specific SPD established by the City, a separate Conceptual
Development Plan with supporting Development Guidelines shall be created and
adopted by Council at the time of establishment of an SPD, following the
procedures set forth in this chapter, and in Chapter
1107.  A Conceptual Development Plan shall be drawn to a scale of a minimum of
one (1) inch equals one hundred (100) feet and shall include the following:
(a)   Circulation Plan, illustrating the basic route of major pedestrian and
vehicular ways within the project and their intersection with existing rights
of way.
(b)   Land Use Plan which shall include schematic presentation of basic land
uses and  their relationship to existing vegetation, topography, and other
natural aspects of the site including descriptions of proposed uses in the non-
residential portions of the site.
(c)   Density, indicating the net density of areas under review and an
indication of the type(s) of structure(s).
(d)   Transitions, including visual illustrations of how transitions/ buffers
will be accomplished between the SPD District and adjacent districts.
(e)   Development Guidelines for the development of the site which may include
lot and yard requirements, signage, parking and landscaping controls.
   The information required above may be combined in any suitable and
convenient manner so long as the data required is clearly indicated. Specific
submission requirements may be waived by the Planning Commission if the
Commission judges the requirement to be inappropriate for the particular
situation.
   The purpose of the Conceptual Plan is to illustrate the character of
development desired by the City.  The Planning Commission shall have the
authority to make adjustments to an approved Conceptual Plan provided that such
changes are limited to site design and configuration and do not include changes
of use, density or other provisions of the Development Guidelines.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1114.06  STATUS OF USES.
   (a)   Uses within each of the SPD districts shall be depicted on the
approved Conceptual Development Plan for that particular SPD. The Conceptual
Development Plan may be divided into subdistricts and may contain provisions
for the following:
      (1)   Principal Permitted Uses.
      (2)   Accessory Uses.
   (b)   All proposed uses shall be arranged to be compatible or properly sited
with each other and not to adversely affect adjacent property and/or the public
health, safety or general welfare.
   (c)   Open spaces, whether active or passive in nature, shall be approved by
the Planning Commission as appropriate in nature for the type of SPD being
established.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1114.07  GENERAL DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES.
   The following general guidelines are recommended in the development of an
SPD:
(a)   Lots.
(1)   Lot widths, setbacks and side yards and building heights are flexible in
order to allow for a variety of structural and design arrangements. In
reviewing building spacing proposals in SPD plans, the Planning Commission will
consider factors such as spacing necessary for adequate visual and acoustic
privacy, adequate light and air, fire and emergency access, glassed wall areas,
building configurations, energy efficient siting principles and relationship of
building sites to circulation patterns.
(2)   Because of the flexibility intended for building siting within an SPD,
individual building sites should be selected on the basis of topographic, land
use, visual and privacy considerations. Individual building sites shall be
designated on the preliminary and final development plans.
(3)   All buildings on the perimeter of the SPD should be separated from the
SPD boundary by a yard equal to at least the yard required by the conventional
zoning district directly adjacent to the SPD.  Structures within the SPD which
exceed the maximum building height of the adjacent conventional zoning district
should be separated from the SPD perimeter by a distance equal to at least the
building height. The Planning Commission may require greater distances if
necessary to protect adjacent property.
(b)   Open Space.
(1)   A minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the net area of the SPD shall be
reserved in perpetuity for common open space and/or recreational facilities.
Such open space should be available to and accessible to all properties in the
SPD and should be designed primarily for their use. Open space, when
incorporated, shall be exclusive of all streets, non-recreational buildings and
individually-owned land. Design of common open space areas are recommended to
consider the following standards:
A.   Open space areas and recreation areas should be distributed throughout the
SPD and located so as to be readily accessible, available to, and usable by
properties in the SPD. Each parcel within the PUD should be designed to abut
upon common open space areas.
B.   Common open space may be improved with appropriate recreation facilities
and structures as long as total paved or roofed areas do not exceed five
percent (5%) of the total open space area.
C.   Significant natural amenities such as outcroppings, tree stands, ponds,
ravines and stream channels should be left in their natural state and
considered part of the required open space, subject to the above standards.
(2)   The sections creating and regulating an SPD shall not be interpreted to
exempt any such development from compliance with the open space provisions of
Section
1113.06, Open Space Provisions. Public open space dedicated under the
provisions of Section
1113.06 shall be included as part of the common open space implemented under
this section.
(3)   Public open space and the adjacent circulation system should be designed
to limit through traffic on existing and proposed local streets. Public open
space which is to be developed as a major activity center such as a swimming
pool or recreation center should be located on a thoroughfare designed to
accommodate the resulting trip desires and traffic volumes.
   (c)   Disposition of Common Open Space.  An SPD shall receive approval
subject to submission, prior to final subdivision approval, of legal
instruments setting forth a plan or manner of permanent care and maintenance of
common open spaces and recreation facilities.  Approval by the Planning
Commission of such instruments shall be based on the following standards:
(1)   The instruments shall guarantee that open space as shown on the final
development plan will remain as such. The Planning Commission may require that
all development rights to the open space be deeded to the City or such other
appropriate public body, or that permanent restrictive covenants be attached to
the open space.
(2)   Common open space and recreation facilities shall be deeded to a
homeowners association, funded community trust or similar entity. If a private
entity is to hold title to common open space and recreation facilities, such
entity shall not be dissolved nor shall it dispose of any common open space or
recreation facility without first offering to dedicate the same to the City.
(3)   Such instruments shall convey to the City and other appropriate
governmental bodies the right of entrance to the common open space and
recreation facilities for emergency purposes or in the event of nonperformance
of maintenance or improvements affecting the public interest. Such governments
shall have the right, after proper notice, to make improvements and perform
maintenance functions with the costs levied as a lien against the property.
Advance notice is not necessary for emergency entrance onto such common areas
and facilities.
(4)   The Planning Commission may require a bond in lieu of provision or
dedication of the required open space in cases where final subdivision plats
are approved in stages.  The amount of such bonds shall be calculated on the
basis of three hundred sixty dollars ($360.00) for each dwelling unit not
provided with its full complement of open space, according to the following
formula:
 
(0.03A) - OS
    0.3A          x  DU x $360.00 = Bond
         Where      A = Total area within approved final plats to date
               DU = Total dwelling units approved on final plats to date
               OS = Total open space approved on final plats to date
   (d)   Circulation.  Vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems should be
designed to insure safe, efficient movement through the SPD and into the
surrounding street systems. Design of circulation systems should consider the
following standards:
(1)   Safe and easy access by emergency vehicles is provided for all areas of
the SPD.
(2)   There should not be any direct access from single-family residential lots
to an arterial thoroughfare.  Direct access from single-family residential lots
to collector thoroughfares should be minimized.
(3)   Principal vehicular access points shall be designed to permit smooth
traffic flow with controlled turning movements and minimum hazards to vehicular
or pedestrian traffic. Minor streets within the SPD should be designed to
discourage their use by through traffic.
(4)   The pedestrian and bicycle circulation system and their related walkways
should be insulated as much as possible from the vehicular system in order to
provide separation of pedestrian and bicycle movement from vehicular movement.
This may include pedestrian and bicycle overpasses or underpasses in the
vicinity of schools, commercial areas and such other areas likely to generate a
considerable amount of pedestrian and bicycle traffic.
(5)   Standards for design and construction of streets and thoroughfares within
an SPD shall be subject to standards specified in the Subdivision Regulations.
(e)   Utilities.  Utilities shall be located underground, including telephone
and electrical systems, within the limits of the SPD.  Appurtenances to these
systems which can be effectively screened may be exempt from this requirement
if the Planning Commission finds that such exemption will not violate the
intent or character of the proposed SPD.
(f)   Commercial and Institutional Uses. 
(1)   Commercial, service, industrial or institutional uses should be planned
as groups having common/shared parking areas and common ingress and egress
points in order to reduce the number of potential accident locations at
intersections with thoroughfares.  Appropriate buffering should be provided on
the perimeter of the commercial or institutional areas where abutting
residential areas.
(2)   All areas designed for future expansion or not intended for immediate
improvement or development should be landscaped or otherwise maintained in a
neat and orderly manner.
         (Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1114.08  PRELIMINARY PLAN APPROVAL.
   (a)   Once an SPD District is established through the review and approval by
Planning Commission and City Council, along with its Conceptual Development
Plan and supporting Development Guidelines, the next step is Preliminary Plan
approval. There are no time constraints as to when the Preliminary Plan must be
submitted after the establishment of an SPD District. The purpose of a
Preliminary Plan is to define in greater detail the proposed development of an
SPD District to ensure that there is conformance with the Conceptual
Development Plan and Development Guidelines prior to substantial cost
expenditures by the developer.
   (b)   Application for approval of a Preliminary Development Plan shall be
made to the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall review the
proposed Preliminary Plan at one or more of its regular meetings, and within
forty-five (45) days after the date of the submission of the proposed
Preliminary Plan, approve, approve with modification or disapprove the
application. The Planning Commission shall review the Preliminary Plan to see
if it is in conformance with the approved Conceptual Plan and Development
Guidelines. Submission of a Preliminary Development Plan may be made for all or
a portion of a tract covered by the existing Conceptual Development Plan.
   (c)   If the Preliminary Plan is not found to be in compliance with the
Conceptual Development Plan by the Planning Commission, the applicant may go to
City Council for the approval of a new Conceptual Development Plan, in which
case the procedures set forth in Sections
1114.05,
1114.06 and
1107.06 shall be followed.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1114.09  SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR PRELIMINARY PLAN REVIEW.
   Preliminary Plans shall be drawn to a scale of a minimum of one (1) inch

      (Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1114.10  FINAL SITE PLAN APPROVAL.
   After a Preliminary Plan in a Special Planning District (SPD) has been
reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission, the next step is Final Site
Plan approval. Final Site Plans shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission in
accordance with the existing Site Plan Review procedure found in Chapter
1109 and with additional Development Guidelines review criteria adopted for
each Special Planning District.
   In addition to the Site Plan Review list of data required with application
as set forth in Chapter
1109, the Planning Commission shall have other data requirements for reviewing

permitted. Action by the Planning Commission on Final Site Plan approval is
final. Such action may be appealed in accordance with Ohio law.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1114.11  REVISION TO APPROVED SITE PLAN.
   After the Final Site Plan has been approved by the Planning Commission, the
following provisions will apply to substantial changes made to the Site Plan:
(a)   Substantial Variations.  New plans, or site design shall be submitted to
the same review process as Final Site Plan Review per Chapter
1109. When changes are determined by Planning Commission to be inconsistent
with the existing Conceptual Development Plan and Development Guidelines in
terms of land use or density, the applicant must go to City Council for

Appendix
 
1116.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of Overlay District regulations is to assist with the
development of land and structures to be compatible with the environment and to
protect the quality of the urban environment in those locations where the
characteristics of the area are of significant public value and are vulnerable
to damage by development permitted under conventional zoning and building
regulations. Overlay Districts are established to provide additional land use
controls and are superimposed over existing zoning districts. Property within
an Overlay District is also subject to the provisions of its underlying zoning
designation; provided, however, that where the provisions of the Overlay
District are more restrictive than the provisions of the underlying zoning
designation, the provisions of the Overlay District shall apply. Overlay
Districts are intended to serve one or more of the following purposes:
(a)   To implement land use and urban design recommendations and standards set
forth in neighborhood or corridor area plans, which plans have been adopted as
part of the City's Comprehensive Plan;
(b)   To provide uniformity in the design standards applicable to arterial
corridors having varied underlying zoning;
(c)   To provide uniform standards for mitigating the impact of intensive
commercial uses adjacent to low density residential uses;
(d)   To protect the public and property owners from blighting influences which
might be caused by application of conventional land use regulations to
properties and areas having sensitive environmental qualities;
(e)   To protect the public from unsafe buildings or unstable land which would
be caused by uncontrolled development;
(f)   To prevent significant damage to the economic value and efficiency of
operation of existing properties and/or new developments due to the
interdependence of their visual and functional relationships;
(g)   To protect the public from blighting influences in areas of high public
investment which have added substantial value to a neighborhood; and
(h)   To provide for the protection of special features in the natural and
built environment.
      (Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1116.02  EFFECT OF UNDERLYING ZONE DESIGNATION.
   All of the provisions of the underlying zone district shall be in full force
and effect, unless such provisions are specifically varied by the provisions of
the applicable Overlay District; provided, however, an Overlay District shall
not be used to add to the specific permitted uses in the underlying district.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1116.03  IDENTIFICATION.
   The location of all Overlay Districts shall be shown on the Zoning Map of
the City of Medina as an Overlay superimposed in specific areas over existing
zones.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1116.04  ESTABLISHMENT OF OVERLAY DISTRICTS.
   City Council may, from time to time, create Overlay Districts as defined and
containing the characteristics, as set forth in Section
1116.01. The procedure for creating Overlay Districts shall be the same as
those for approving a map amendment as set out in Section
1107.06.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1116.05  GUIDELINES.
   The Planning Commission shall prepare, pursuant to this Chapter, Overlay
District Development Guidelines. The Overlay District Development Guidelines
shall describe in words and/or illustrations the special and distinctive
characteristics which are to be protected and the development features which
will be reviewed for impact within an Overlay District. The Overlay District
Development Guidelines shall be recommended to the City Council which after
adoption shall be considered a part of the Zoning Ordinance when the
application is for a property within an Overlay District.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1116.06  CLASSIFICATION.
   Overlay Districts shall be classified by categories, according to the
provisions and qualifications as described in Section
1116.07. The findings and purpose statement and characteristics identified in
Section
1116.07 shall be used to determine areas appropriate for designation.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1116.07  TRANSITION CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT (TC-OV).
   (a)   Findings and Purposes. A transition corridor is identified as one of
the corridors listed in the City's Comprehensive Plan, or a similar area, that
is experiencing an increased demand for commercial uses in areas that
previously were residential. It is important that the visual appearance and
composition of these areas be maintained in order to put forth a positive image
of Medina at these important "Gateways" into the City. It is in the interest of
the City to protect and enhance the built features of such transition corridors
by:
(1)   Preventing the deterioration of property and the extension of blighting
conditions.
(2)   Revitalizing and protecting private investment which improves and
stimulates the economic vitality and social character of the area.
(3)   Encouraging development that creates compatible relationships with the
residential character that has been established.
(4)   Enhancing the aesthetic and architectural compatibility within
neighborhoods and commercial areas.
   (b)   Characteristics.  TC-OV Districts as herein defined shall be found to
contain at least one of the following characteristics:
(1)   Function as a primary gateway or corridor into the City of Medina;
(2)   Possess mixture of residential and nonresidential uses;
(3)   Exhibit a current trend or potential for the further conversion of
residential uses to nonresidential uses; and
(4)   Contain a mixture of residential and nonresidential zoning
classifications within the corridor.
   (c)   Guidelines.  Guidelines for the TC-OV District are located in the
appendix of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1116.08  DEVELOPMENT APPROVALS REQUIRED.
   (a)   The guidelines and regulations of this Chapter shall only apply to the
proposed addition or improvement unless the addition or improvement results in
a square footage that is greater than fifty percent (50%) of the square footage
of the existing structure or building.  If the proposed addition or improvement
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the square footage of the existing building or
structure, then the entire property shall be brought into compliance with these
guidelines and regulations. 
   (b)   No alteration or change shall be made to any property within an
Overlay District, except as exempted by Section
1116.09, until approvals have been given by the Planning Commission. No
Building or Zoning Permit shall be issued for any site improvement,
construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition of any structure now or
hereafter in an Overlay District, unless approvals have been issued by the
Planning Commission.
   (c)   Minor building improvements may be administratively reviewed and
approved by the Planning Director for compliance with the guidelines.  Any
improvement which is not in compliance with the guidelines or is determined by

1137.01  PURPOSE.
   The C-3 General Commercial District is established to provide for uses in
addition to those specified for the local and commercial Retail Office
District, and thereby provide service and sales in support of the primary
business activities in the community.  This District includes activities which
because of their nature, such as their tendency to encourage traffic congestion
and parking problems, storage problems or certain other inherent dangers, that
create special problems, are, therefore, best distinguished from other
commercial activity.  Their location is advantageous at specified points on
major thoroughfares at outlying locations in the community.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)

to the Planning Director that the uses will not substantially overlap in hours
of operation or in demand for the shared spaces. This shall be guaranteed by a
written agreement from the owner or between the owners involved and all future
owners or assigns which shall be submitted with the required plan.  Shared
parking spaces shall be located no more than three hundred feet (300') from the

   Joint use of parking areas is encouraged.  The Planning Commission may
permit parking to extend to the side or rear property line in the case of a
joint parking area.

coverage, the artificial increase in air temperature, and surface water run-
off, no minimum off-street parking space requirement in Section
1145.04 , Schedule of Parking Requirements and Standards, shall be exceeded by
more than twenty percent (20%) unless good cause can be shown by the applicant
and approved by the Planning Commission.  Single Family Dwellings and Two
Family Dwellings are exempt from this provision.
   (f)   Handicapped Parking Spaces.  Parking spaces for handicapped
individuals shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of the Ohio
Basic Building Code and the Ohio Revised Code.

facilities district areas, open off-street parking may be located in a required
front yard provided a minimum ten (10) foot wide landscaped strip is located
between the parking area and the street right-of-way line. In all districts,
off-street parking facilities may occupy the required side and rear yard.
   (h)   Pedestrian Connection.  Where a sidewalk exists in a public right-of-
way adjacent to a site, or when a sidewalk is required to be constructed as
part of development approval, a pedestrian connection shall be constructed from
the building to the sidewalk.

1145.09  PARKING AREA DESIGN.
   (a)   Grading, Marking, Pavement and Curbing.
(1)   Parking areas and driveways insofar as possible shall be graded and
drained so as to dispose of all surface water, including the use of permeable
surfaces if approved by the City Engineer, without injury or nuisance to
adjacent properties or the public, and improved with concrete or asphalt, in
accordance with the standards of the City. 
(2)   Parking spaces shall be so arranged and marked to provide for orderly and
safe parking and storage of vehicles in accordance with Section
1145.08, Parking Area Dimensions, and shall be so improved with curbs to define
the limits of paved areas.
(3)   For industrial uses, the following design provisions shall apply:
A.   Paved parking areas and drives shall extend from the street right-of-way
to the rear of the building.  Parking areas or drives beyond the rear of the
building do not have to be hard surfaced.  Compacted gravel, concrete or
asphalt may be utilized behind the rear of the building.
B.   Curbs for driveways or off-street parking shall not be required in
industrial areas.
C.   Parking lot landscaping shall not be required if the off-street parking
lot is located in the side or rear yard.
   (b)   Landscaping.  Landscape features or other visual barriers between all
parking areas and a side or rear lot line of an adjoining residential district
shall be required.  Such landscaping shall also be required when adjacent to a
public street.
   In all commercial, multi-family, industrial and public facilities district
areas, open off-street parking may be located in a required front yard provided
a minimum ten (10) foot wide landscaped strip is located between the parking
area and the street right-of-way line unless a lesser depth is permitted by the
Planning Commission due to site constraints.  In no case shall the landscape
strip be less than five (5) feet.  In all districts, off-street parking
facilities may occupy the required side and rear yard.
   Parking areas containing more than 6,000 square feet of area or twenty (20)
or more vehicular parking spaces, whichever is less, shall provide interior
landscaping of the peninsular or island types of uncompact, well-drained soil
as well as perimeter landscaping.  For each 100 square feet or fraction thereof
of parking area, at least five (5) square feet of landscape area shall be
provided.
(1)   Interior landscape requirements:
A.   Minimum Area.  The minimum landscape area permitted shall be sixty-four
(64) square feet with a four (4)-foot minimum dimension to all trees from edge
of pavement where vehicles overhang.
B.   Surface.  Any landscaped area provided under this section shall be covered
with mulch or vegetative ground cover.
C.   Natural or landscaped detention basins may count toward the minimum square
footage landscaping requirements when the basins are in the front or side
yards.
D.   Vehicle Overhang.  Parked vehicles may hang over the interior landscaped
area no more than two and one-half (2½) feet.  The Commission may modify the
foregoing requirements in specific cases where desirable or warranted, owing to
unusual topography, physical conditions and the use and character of adjacent
properties.
   (c)   Illumination of Parking Areas.  Parking and circulation areas,
pedestrian areas and related outdoor areas shall be illuminated to provide
safety and security to users of these areas, to provide security for property,
and to maintain privacy for adjacent properties.  Exterior lighting shall be
designed, installed and maintained according to the following standards:

Property security only       0.2 fc minimum
1  Exterior lighting in these areas may be reduced to the property security
level during hours when these areas are not in use.
 
(2)   Residential parking.  The minimum illumination levels in subsection (c)
(1) hereof shall not apply to residential or multi-family parking areas with
ten (10) or fewer parking spaces.  These areas shall be provided with
appropriate residential-type luminaries as shown on site plans approved by the
Planning Commission.
(3)   Uniformity ratio.  Average illumination levels shall not exceed four (4)
times the minimum level.
(4)   Light trespass.  In order to maintain privacy, exterior lighting shall be
designed and maintained to provide a maximum of one horizontal footcandle
illumination at side or rear property lines which are adjacent to a residential
use or zoning district.
(5)   Luminaire height. 
A.   The maximum luminaire height in the C-3 and I-1 Districts shall be twenty-
five (25) feet.
B.   The maximum luminaire height in all other districts shall be ten (10) feet
unless authorized by Planning Commission.
C.   The Planning Commission may approve greater heights upon a showing by the
applicant that the additional height complies with both of the following
standards:
1.   The additional height is necessary to efficiently illuminate outdoor
areas; and
2.   The additional height will have no adverse effect on adjacent properties.
(6)   Glare.  Exterior lighting shall be designed and maintained so that glare
is not cast on adjacent properties, regardless of use, or on adjacent streets. 
All luminaries shall be cut-off types which includes shields or other devices
which eliminate all light above an angle of eighty-five (85) degrees, as
measured from the vertical axis of the light source.  For the purpose of this
subsection, "glare" means the brightness of a light source which causes eye
discomfort.
(7)   Lighting plan submission.  Site plans submitted to the Planning
Commission shall include data analyses, prepared by persons competent to do so,
that the proposed exterior lighting system complies with the standards in this
section.

1146.01  PURPOSE.
   These regulations are established to provide for the construction and use of
Wireless Telecommunication Facilities in the City. The purpose of these
regulations is to balance the competing interests created by the federal
Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104, codified at 47 U.S.C. §§151
et seq.) and the interests of the City in regulating Wireless Telecommunication
Facilities for the following reasons:
(a)   To provide for orderly development within the City;
(b)   To protect property values;
(c)   To maintain the aesthetic appearance of the City, including, but not
limited to, its unique residential character, historic character, unobstructed
open spaces and attractive commercial/office areas;
(d)   To protect residential properties, open spaces and nonintensive
commercial zoning districts which are characteristic of the City from adverse
effects of Towers and related Facilities;
(e)   To promote collocation of Wireless Telecommunications Facilities in order
to decrease the total number of Towers in the City;
(f)   To provide for and protect the health, safety and general welfare of the
residents and visitors of the City; and,
(g)   To maintain, where possible, the integrity of the existing zoning
regulations contained in the Zoning Ordinance.
   The regulations establish a hierarchy of acceptable land areas for the
location of Wireless Telecommunication Facilities through the establishment of
such as a conditional use in certain zoning districts which determination is
dependent upon the location and characteristics of such land areas.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)

1147.01  PURPOSE.
   Sign regulations, including provisions controlling the type, design, size
and location thereof, are established to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare through the provision of standards for existing and proposed
signs of all types by:
(a)   Enhancing and protecting the physical appearance of the community;
(b)   Promoting and maintaining visually attractive residential, commercial,
industrial, and other use districts;
(c)   Ensuring that signs are located and designed to reduce sign distraction
and confusion that may be contributing factors in traffic congestion and
accidents, and maintain safe and orderly pedestrian and vehicular environments;
(d)   Providing review procedures that enable the City to evaluate the
appropriateness of a sign to the site, building and surroundings; and
(e)   Prohibiting all signs not expressly permitted by this Chapter.
      (Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1147.02  INTERPRETATION.
   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Chapter, as
most recently amended, shall be held to be the minimum requirements.
   The provisions herein shall not amend or in any way interfere with other
codes, rules or regulations governing signs within the City. Whenever there is
a conflict between any provisions of any adopted ordinance, the more
restrictive provisions shall govern.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1147.03  APPLICATION.
   (a)   The regulations contained in this Chapter shall apply to signs outside
of the public right-of-way, except when specifically stated otherwise.
   (b)   A sign may only be erected, established, painted, created or
maintained in the City in conformance with the standards, procedures,
exemptions, and other requirements of this Chapter.
   (c)   Architectural features that are either part of the building or part of
a freestanding structure are not considered signs and are thus exempt from
these regulations.  Architectural features include:
(1)   Any construction attending to, but not an integral part of the sign, and
which may consist of landscape or building or structural forms that enhance the
site in general.
(2)   Graphic stripes and other architectural painting techniques applied to a
structure that serves a functional purpose or to a building when the stripes or
other painting technique does not include lettering, logos or pictures.
   (d)   In addition, the following signs and displays shall be specifically
exempted from and not regulated by this Chapter:
(1)   Safety and public purpose signs and flags of any nation, government or
public service organization, as determined by the Safety Director or designee
thereof.
(2)   Scoreboards on athletic fields.
(3)   Cornerstone inscriptions, commemorative plaques or other text and
graphics that are part of facades and/or intended for viewing from within the
property.
(4)   Gravestones, religious symbols or monuments in cemeteries or monument
sales lots.
(5)   Signs not exceeding one (1) square foot in sign area such as street
numbers on buildings, security system signs or stickers, identification of
store hours, emblems of credit cards accepted, and seals indicating membership
in business or trade associations.
(6)   Signs accessory to juvenile activities, such as a child's lemonade stand
or temporary play-related sidewalk markings.
(7)   Holiday or other temporary decorations.
(8)   Instructional signs, as determined by the Planning Director.
(9)   Other signs similar in nature in the judgment of the Planning Director to
the above signs.
         (Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1147.04  NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   (a)   Continuation.  The purpose of this Section is to provide for the
continuation of, as well as limitations on, nonconforming signs.
   (b)     Maintenance.  A nonconforming sign shall be maintained in good
condition pursuant to this Chapter, and may continue until such sign is
required to be removed as set forth in this Section.
   (c)     Servicing.  Sign panel replacement (including changeable copy),
painting, servicing, cleaning or minor repairs to a nonconforming sign shall be
permitted, subject to the following requirements:
      (1)   The sign shall be restored to its original design;
      (2)   There shall be no changes to location, structure or framing; and
      (3)   All work is in compliance with applicable codes and regulations, as
well as all other provisions of this Chapter.
   (d)   Alteration and Removal.  A nonconforming sign shall immediately lose
its legal nonconforming status and shall be brought into compliance with this
Chapter when the sign's structure is voluntarily removed by the owner.
   (e)   Severability.  Nothing in this Chapter shall prohibit the construction
of a nonconforming sign for which a Zoning Certificate has been issued prior to
the effective date of this Chapter, or any amendment thereto, provided that
construction is completed within ninety (90) days after the issuance of the
Zoning Certificate. 
(Ord. 29-19.  Passed 2-25-19.)
1147.05  ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Zoning Certificates Required.  From and after the effective date of
this Chapter, no person may erect, alter or relocate any of the signs permitted
by this Chapter, except for signplates, without first obtaining a Zoning
Certificate from the Planning Director and paying the required fee (if
applicable) and meeting all application and issuance requirements established
by the Planning Director.  Temporary signs are subject to administrative
approval but do not have additional fees associated therein.
   (b)   Maintenance.  Routine maintenance of a sign shall not be considered an
alteration of a sign, provided that the maintenance does not alter the type of
installation, surface area, height, or otherwise make the sign nonconforming.
   (c)   Removal.  When a sign requiring a Zoning Certificate is removed for
any reason, all mast arms, guywires of any nature, clips, brackets, and all
other components of the removed sign shall be removed with the sign.  A new
Zoning Certificate shall be required for any subsequent installation of a sign,
including but not limited to reinstallation of the removed sign.
   (d)   Registration Required.  All temporary signs, except for real estate
and window signs, located in nonresidential districts shall be registered
pursuant to requirements established by the Planning Director.
   (e)   Fees.  Each application for approval pursuant to this Chapter shall be
accompanied by the payment of the fee established in Chapter
1108 of the Planning and Zoning Code.  In addition, the reviewing official or
board or commission, where appropriate, may refer an application to qualified
consultants for a report if the reviewing official or board or commission deems
the proposed use may require special study.  The cost of such report shall be
at the expense of the applicant, in accordance with a policy established and
amended from time to time by Council.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1147.06  SIGN COMPUTATION.
   The following regulations shall control the computation and measurement of
sign area, sign height, and building frontage:
(a)   Determining Sign Area.  Sign area shall include the sign face and frame,
but shall not include the structural support unless such structural support is
illuminated or determined to constitute an integral part of the sign design.
(1)   For a sign that is framed, outlined, painted or otherwise prepared and
intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area of the sign shall
be the area of one rectangular shape that encompasses the entire background or
frame.
(2)   For a ground or wall sign comprised of individual letters, figures or
elements, the area of the sign shall be the area of one rectangular shape that
encompasses the perimeter of all of the elements in the display, including any
open space separating such elements.
(3)   For a window sign comprised of individual letters, figures or elements,
the area of the sign shall be the area of one or more rectangular shapes that
encompass the perimeter of each of the elements in the display, excluding any
open space separating such elements.
(4)   One minor extension may be permitted to extend above or below the sign
area when the area of the extension is less than twenty-five percent (25%)  of
the open space created by the extension. For the purposes of this Chapter, only
the open space within the sign area shall be included in the calculation.
(5)   The area of a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding
together the area of all sign faces.  When two identical sign faces are joined
back to back, and not more than twelve (12) inches apart or form an angle not
more than forty-five (45) degrees, the sign area shall be the area of one of
the sign faces.
(6)   Air under a ground sign between supporting posts, air between a
projecting sign and the wall to which it is attached, and lighting fixtures and
associated brackets shall not be included in the calculation of sign area.
(7)   Street address numerals not exceeding seven inches in height shall not be
included in the calculation of sign area.  Street address numerals exceeding
seven (7) inches in height shall be included in the calculation of sign area.
(b)   Determining Sign Height.  The height of a sign shall be measured from the
average grade at the base of the sign or support structure to the tallest
element of the sign structure.  Decorative caps, finials, and similar design
elements not exceeding twelve (12) inches in height and located on top of
supporting posts for a ground sign shall not be included in the calculation of
sign height.  A ground sign on a man-made base, including a graded earth mound,
shall be measured from the lowest point of the base or mound.
(c)   Determining Building Frontage and Building Unit for Wall, Awning, and
Canopy Signs.  For the purposes of this Chapter, the length of the building
wall that faces a street or building wall that contains a public entrance to
the uses therein shall be considered building frontage.
(1)   Building frontage shall be measured along such building wall between the
exterior faces of the exterior side walls.
(2)   In the case of an irregular wall surface, a single straight line extended
along such wall surface shall be used to measure the length.
(3)   A building shall have only one building frontage except as otherwise set
forth below. 
(4)   A building shall be considered to have a second frontage whenever the lot
fronts on two (2) or more streets, or the building has a public entrance on a
wall other than the wall that faces the street.  The property owner shall
determine which wall shall be the primary building frontage and which wall
shall be the secondary building frontage.  A building shall not be permitted to
have a third building frontage. 
(5)   For multi-occupant buildings, the portion of a building that is owned or
leased by a single occupant shall be considered a building unit.  The building
frontage for a building unit shall be measured from the centerline of the party
walls defining the building unit.
         (Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1147.07  GENERAL STANDARDS.
   (a)   Setbacks.  All permanent ground signs shall be located not closer than
ten (10) feet to any side lot line and not closer than five (5) feet to any
right-of-way.
   (b)   Illumination.
(1)   Temporary signs shall not be illuminated.  Permanent signs may be
internally or externally illuminated, except where prohibited in this Chapter. 
The source of illumination shall not be visible, shall be fully shielded, and
shall cause no glare hazardous to pedestrians, motorists or adjacent
residential uses and districts.
(2)   External illumination shall be limited to fixtures that use a maximum 150
watt metal halide, tungsten-halogen or incandescent lamp.  Such fixtures shall
be directed towards and concentrated on the sign face to prevent glare upon
adjacent properties and rights-of-way.
(3)   Illumination shall be provided solely by electrical means or devices.
(4)   Internal illumination shall be prohibited for awning signs, as well as
for all signs in the M-U District and Historic District.
   (c)   Traffic and Pedestrian Hazards. 
(1)   No sign shall obstruct traffic sight lines, traffic sign signals at
railroad grade crossings or other safety signs.
(2)   No sign shall be placed, erected or maintained so as to obstruct, in any
manner, any fire escape, window, door, entrance to or exit from any building.
   (d)   Design Criteria.  The following design criteria shall apply to all
signs:
(1)   Signs in series.  Signs to be seen in series, (such as signs on multi-
tenant buildings) shall be designed with continuity and compatibility in terms
of style, materials, color, size, and placement on the building facade.
(2)   Wall sign placement.  A wall sign shall be designed to fit within a frame
of architectural space specifically intended for signage, and shall not project
beyond the ends or top of the building wall to which it is attached.
(3)   Ground sign compatibility and landscaping.  A ground sign shall be
compatible with the design and materials of the building with which the sign is
associated.  Approved year-round landscaping shall be provided around the base
of a ground sign.
   (e)   Construction.  All signs and parts thereof, including cables, guys,
braces, supports, etc., shall be securely constructed in conformance with
applicable City Building, Fire, and Electrical Codes, and the applicable
standards of this Chapter.  Wood products should be treated to prevent
deterioration.  A lightning grounding device shall be provided where required. 
Letters, figures, and characters shall be securely attached to the sign
structure.  All signs shall have a surface or facing of materials which are
durable for the intended life of the signs.  All signs shall be attached by
means of metal anchors, bolts or expansion screws, and in no case shall any
sign be secured with wire, strips of wood or nails.
   (f)   Rights-of-Way.  No signs shall be erected, placed or overhung in a
right-of-way or supported, braced or guyed from or to a public sidewalk,
street, alley or public thoroughfare except those signs provided or approved by
the City Engineer or Planning Director.  Signs placed within the right of way
without the approval of the City Engineer or Planning Director are subject to
immediate removal. 
   (g)   Accessory Use.  A sign shall be accessory to the principal use of the
lot on which the sign is located, except as otherwise permitted by this
Chapter.
   (h)   Smooth Sign Face.  No nails, tacks or wires shall be permitted to
protrude from the front of any sign.
   (i)   Changeable Copy.  Changeable copy area, permitted for ground signs
only (excluding pole signs), shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the total
sign area of a single sign.
   (j)   Electronic Message Center Signs.  Electronic message center signs,
permitted for ground signs only (excluding pole signs), shall be conditionally
permitted in all districts, except the M-U, Historic, and TC-OV Districts,
where such signs shall be prohibited.  An electronic message center sign shall
meet the following requirements:
(1)   Frequency.  Copy change shall not be more frequently than once per thirty
(30) seconds.
(2)   Color. Copy can be single or full color.
(3)   Illumination. The intensity of the lights used in the message center
shall not constitute a visual hazard for vehicular or pedestrian traffic.  The
sign shall be equipped with and shall use photosensitive equipment which
automatically adjusts the brightness and contrast of the sign in direct
relation to the ambient outdoor illumination.  The Planning Director shall
utilize reasonable judgment in determining whether the lighting constitutes a
visual hazard. 
(Ord. 104-15.  Passed 8-24-15.)
   (k)   Outline Lighting of the Building or Roof Line.  Outline lighting of
the building or roof line shall be conditionally permitted in all districts,
except the M-U and Historic Districts, where such signs shall be prohibited. 
Outline lighting of the building or roof line shall meet the following
requirements:
(1)   Color.  Copy shall be limited to a single color, as determined by the
Planning Commission.
(2)   Illumination.  An applicant shall provide a photometric plan outlining
proposed illumination levels (in foot-candles).  Illumination levels shall not
exceed one foot-candle, as measured from adjacent rights-of-way and residential
uses and districts.
         (Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1147.08  SIGN IDENTIFICATION, MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR.
   All signs, temporary or permanent, including supports, guys, braces and
anchors for such signs, regardless of whether or not a Zoning Certificate is
required, shall be maintained in a safe, presentable, and good structural
condition at all times, including the replacement of defective parts,
repainting, cleaning, and other acts required for the maintenance of such
sign.  The Planning Director may order any sign to be painted or refurbished at
least once each year, if needed, to keep the sign in a safe, presentable, and
good structural condition.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1147.09  ABANDONED SIGNS.
   Abandoned signs shall be deemed to be a public nuisance by reason that
continued lack of use results in lack of reasonable and adequate maintenance,
thereby causing deterioration and a blighting influence on nearby properties. 
Whenever a sign is abandoned, the Planning Director shall first document the
date of sign abandonment.  An abandoned sign shall be considered a violation of
this chapter only after the Planning Director further documents that both of
the following circumstances exist:
(a)   A period of not less than 180 consecutive days has elapsed since the date
of sign abandonment; and
(b)   No Zoning Certificate has been issued during such period for the
building, building unit and/or use associated with the abandoned sign.
      (Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1147.10  PROHIBITED SIGNS.

1147.16  CONDITIONAL SIGN PERMIT DESIGN GUIDELINES.
   In reviewing a proposal for a conditional sign permit, the Historic
Preservation Board and Planning Commission shall consider whether the proposal
meets the following design guidelines, which are in addition to the design
criteria for all signs listed in Section
1147.07(d):
(Ord. 110-17.  Passed 7-10-17.)
(a)   Lettering should be large enough to be easily read but not overly large
or out of scale with the building or site.
(b)   The ratio between a message and its background should permit easy
recognition of the message.
(c)   The size, style, and location of a proposed sign should be appropriate to
the site and use with which the sign is associated.
(d)   A sign should complement the building with which it is associated, as
well as adjacent buildings, by being designed and placed to enhance the
architecture of the building.
(e)   The color of a sign should be compatible with the color of the building
facade with which it is associated.  A sign should be designed with a minimum
number, and harmonious use, of colors.
(f)   A permanent window sign should be comprised of individual letters, logos
or design elements that are not encompassed by a solid opaque background, so as
not to obscure the view through the window with which the sign is associated.
(g)   The size of the lettering and graphics on a projecting sign should be
appropriate for viewing by pedestrians.
(h)   A ground sign that provides a directory of occupants for a multi-occupant
building should have simplicity of design, to compensate for the additional
amount of information provided (i.e. utilize common elements such as the same
background color, or other common elements, etc.).
(i)   The area of a wall sign should not exceed eighty percent (80%) of the
area of the frame of architectural space specifically intended for signage.
(j)   A projecting sign that is comprised of multiple elements hanging from the
same supports should be designed such that all such elements are compatible in
size, shape, and color.
(k)   Multiple signs associated with a single use should contain similar
materials, colors, and design elements, regardless of sign type(s).
(l)   An awning or canopy sign should be located on the valance of the awning
or canopy.
(m)   Temporary sidewalk signs shall be constructed of materials compatible
with the permanent building signs.  Plastic framing, white background dry erase
boards and changeable letter tracks are discouraged.

1149.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to provide minimum standards involving the
development of land to:
(a)   Provide attractive views from roads and adjacent properties;
(b)   Screen from view visually undesirable uses;
(c)   Require screening between incompatible land uses;
(d)   Protect the health, safety and welfare of the community through the
reduction of noise, air and visual pollution, and headlight glare.
      (Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1149.02  APPLICABILITY.
   This Chapter shall apply to any property subject to the site plan review
process. 
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1149.03  GENERAL REQUIREMENT FOR SUBMISSION.
   Any property to which this Chapter applies shall submit information
regarding screening or landscaping to the Planning Director and Urban Forester
as required by the site plan review process.  Such information shall be
provided by a nursery or by a design professional practicing within their areas
of competence.  Typical details shall be shown for the planting of the types of
trees, shrubs and ground cover within the screening or landscaped area.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1149.04  APPROVAL.
   (a)   Review and approval of the site plan shall constitute approval of the
screening and landscape submission.
   (b)   The Planning Director may request the review and approval of the
Planning Commission at any time during the review and approval process.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1149.05  LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING STANDARDS.
   (a)   Maintenance of Screening and Landscaped Areas.  All screening and
landscaping materials shall be installed and maintained according to accepted
nursery industry procedures.  The owner of the property shall be responsible
for the continued property maintenance of all landscaping materials, and shall
keep them in a proper, neat and orderly appearance, free from refuse and debris
at all times and shall remove all noxious, invasive, or poison type plants as
may be identified by the Urban Forester.  All unhealthy or dead plant material
shall be replaced within one (1) year, or by the next planting period,
whichever comes first.  Violation of these installation and maintenance
provisions may be grounds for the Planning Director to:
(1)   Find the owner of the property in violation of the conditions of the
Zoning Permit;
(2)   Require replacement of the landscape material; or
(3)   Institute legal proceedings to enforce the provisions of this Code.
   (b)   Screening and Landscape Establishment.  Once a screened or landscaped
area has been approved by the Planning Director and established by the owner,
it may not be used, disturbed or altered in any way that would decrease its
landscape or screening effectiveness unless approved by the Planning Director.
   (c)   Screening Requirement.  In order to provide protective screening and
buffers for residentially zoned areas that are adjacent to nonresidential
areas, the Planning Director may require a wall, fence or planted open space to
be provided by any newly developed or substantially expanded nonresidential
property if the nonresidential property is not already sufficiently screened.
   Screening shall be in accordance with the following:
(1)   Screening areas shall be provided for the purpose of minimizing the
visual and noise impact between incompatible land uses by improving the
aesthetic and functional quality of new development.
(2)   Where vegetative and/or topographic conditions already provide a natural
screen and buffer prior to development of properties in question, every effort
shall be made to retain such conditions in good maintenance.  In such cases,
additional screening may not be required by the Planning Director, provided
that provision is made for maintenance of such areas.
(3)   The Planning Director may waive the requirement for a wall, fence or
greenbelt if equivalent screening is provided by existing or planned parks,
parkways, recreation areas or by topography or other natural conditions found
on the subject property.
(4)   Screening Standards.

   (d)   Materials for Screening and Landscaping.
(1)   Walls and Fences.  When walls or fences are used to fulfill screening
requirements, they shall be detailed on the plan.  They are to be of weather-
proof materials.  This includes pressure treating or painting of lumber if it
is not redwood or cedar and using aluminum or galvanized hardware.  Chain link
fences with or without wooded or synthetic slat material shall not be permitted
when used to satisfy screening requirements.
(2)   Plants.  All plants are to be healthy upon planting.  Plant materials
used in conformance with the provision of this Chapter shall be salt tolerant
as necessary and shall conform to the standards of the American Association of
Nurserymen and shall have passed any inspection required under State
regulations.  Trees and plant materials should be species indigenous to Zone 5
of the United States Department of Agriculture Plant Hardiness Zone Map. Trees
shall be balled and burlapped or in containers.  Shrubs, vines and ground
covers can be planted as bare root as well as balled and burlapped or
containers.
A.   Deciduous Trees.  Deciduous trees shall have a minimum caliper of at least
two one and one half (1½) inches conforming to acceptable nursery industry
procedures at the time of planting.  If deciduous trees are to be used for
screening purposes, additional materials listed in this Chapter must be used to
create a dense buffer.
B.   Evergreen Trees.  Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of six (6) feet in
height at the time of planting when used for screening purposes when adjacent
to a Single Family or Two Family Residential District.  Evergreen plantings
used for screening shall be planted so as to provide an effective, dense screen
upon the time of planting.  The height at installation of the planting shall be
measured from the level of the planting surface of the evergreen base.
C.   Shrubs and Hedges.  Shrubs and hedges shall be at least five (5) feet in
height at the time of planting.  All shrubs and hedges shall be designed to
provide an effective, dense screen and mature height of at least six (6) feet
within two (2) years after the date of the final approval of each planting. 
The height at installation of the planting shall be measured from the level of
the surface of the plant base at the edge closest to the screening.
            (Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1149.06  SCREENING AND LANDSCAPING FOR OFF-STREET PARKING AREAS.
   Screening and landscaping for off-street parking areas shall be as
established in Section
1145.09(b), Parking Area Design, Landscaping.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1149.07  SCREENING FOR DUMPSTERS AND TRASH HANDLING AREAS.
   Screening for dumpsters and trash handling areas shall be as established in
Section
1155.05, Dumpsters, Recycling and Donation Boxes.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1149.08  EASEMENTS, RIGHT-OF-WAY, AND SETBACKS.
   (a)   Required screening and landscaping may be placed wholly or partially
in utility or other easements providing all requirements of this Chapter can be
fulfilled and approval is granted by the holder of the easements, in writing. 
   (b)   In no case, however, shall screening or landscaping be established so
as to block the sight distance at street or drive intersections.  Ground cover
and trees with at least six (6) feet of limbless trunk may be permitted within
the sight distance triangle.  In the case of a street intersection, the sight
triangle shall consist of the area between points twenty (20) feet along both
intersecting streets from their respective edge of pavements.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1149.09  MODIFICATIONS.
   The Planning Commission shall have the authority to modify or waive any of
the aforementioned requirements in this Chapter in considering an individual
site with respect to changes in elevation, environmental impact, durability of
plant material, aesthetic appeal, and any other factor that will provide a
compatible screen or buffer with the surrounding property or neighborhood at
the time of application.

1151.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to provide for the continuation of existing
uses, buildings, structures, and lots that do not conform to the current zoning
regulations, but which legally existed prior to the enactment of this Zoning
Ordinance or amendments thereto.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1151.02  REGULATIONS.
   The lawful use of any building, structure, or land existing on the effective
date of this Zoning Ordinance, or amendments thereto, may be continued,
although such use, building, structure,  or lot does not conform to the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
(a)   Nonconforming Uses.
(1)   Alterations.  A building or structure containing a nonconforming use may
be altered, improved or reconstructed, enlarged or extended, provided such
enlargements or extensions do not exceed twenty five percent (25%) of the area
that the nonconforming use occupied as of the effective date of this Zoning
Ordinance.
(2)   Discontinuance or Abandonment.  If a nonconforming use is voluntarily
discontinued for a period of twenty-four (24) consecutive months or more, any
use of the property thereafter shall be in conformance with regulations and
provisions set by this Zoning Ordinance for the district in which such property
is located.  Discontinuance of a nonconforming use may be evidenced by non-use
and the removal of either stock-in-trade or substantially all equipment,
fittings, or furniture needed to operate the use.
(b)   Nonconforming Buildings and Structures.
(1)   Restoration. 
A.   Nothing in this Zoning Ordinance shall prevent the reconstruction,
repairing, rebuilding and continued use of any nonconforming building or
structure, damaged by fire, collapse, explosion or acts of God, subsequent to
the effective date of this Ordinance (see Section
1103.01 , Effective Date), wherein the expense of such work does not exceed
fifty percent (50%) of its fair market value at the time such damage occurred.
B.   A structure devoted solely to a nonconforming single family dwelling or
two-family residential use that is damaged or destroyed by fire, earthquake or
other act of God, may be reconstructed so as not to exceed 110% of the gross
floor area of the previous structure as used before such event of damage or
destruction. All reconstruction of the structure must be completed within two
(2) years following the event of damage or destruction, shall not increase the
degree of nonconformance or noncompliance existing prior to such damage or
destruction, and shall otherwise be in conformance with this Zoning Ordinance.
(2)   Enlargement. 
A.   A nonconforming structure may be expanded provided the proposed expansion
does not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the existing footprint and:
1.   The expansion does not increase the degree of non-conformity; and,
2.   The extension of a structure which is nonconforming due to side yard
setback shall be allowed so long as the extension is not closer to the side
property line and the extension does not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of
the existing structure length, including porches and architectural features but
excluding decks. Existing footprint and structure length shall mean the
dimensions as they existed upon the effective date of this provision.
B.   A nonconforming structure may otherwise be enlarged, increased, or
extended beyond the area it occupied as of the effective date of this
provision, provided the Board of Zoning Appeals, pursuant to the procedure set
forth in Section
1107.08  of this Zoning Ordinance, approves such enlargement, increase, or
extension under the following conditions:
1.   The enlargement will not interfere with the operation of conforming uses
in the district or with circulation on adjacent public streets; and
2.   The enlarged structure will cause no greater adverse impacts on
surrounding properties than did the original conforming structure.
(3)   Construction Approved Prior to Ordinance.  Nothing in this Zoning
Ordinance shall prohibit the completion of construction and use of a
nonconforming building or structure for which a zoning certificate has been
issued prior to the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance (see Section
1103.01 , Effective Date) or any amendment thereto, provided that construction
is commenced within one year after the issuance of such certificate; that
construction is carried on diligently and without interruption for a continuous
period in excess of thirty (30) days; and the entire building or structure has
been completed within two (2) years after the issuance of such zoning
certificate.
(4)   Unsafe Structures.  Nothing in this Zoning Ordinance shall prevent the
strengthening or repair to a safe condition of any portion of a nonconforming
building or structure declared unsafe by a proper authority.
(c)   Nonconforming Lots.  Any lot not meeting minimum area requirements and
being a lot of record on the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, may be
used for a single-family dwelling irrespective of the area, depth or width of
such lot; the width of the side yard of any such lot need not exceed ten (10%)
percent of the width of the lot; the depth of the rear yard need not exceed
twenty (20%) percent of the depth of the lot. However, in no instance shall the
minimum dimensions of the side and rear yards be less than five (5) and twenty

   The Planning Director may upon his/her own initiative, or shall, upon
request of the owner, issue a certificate for any lot, building, structure, use
of land, use of building or structure, or use of land and structure in
combination, that certifies that the lot, building, structure or use is a legal
nonconforming use.  The certificate shall specify the reason why the lot,
building, structure, or use is a nonconforming use, including a description of
the extent and kind of use made of the property in question, the portion of the
structure or land used for the nonconforming use, and the extent that

lot existing therein.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1151.05  SUBSTITUTION OF NONCONFORMING USES.
   So long as no structural alterations are made, except as required by
enforcement of other codes or ordinances, any nonconforming use may, upon
appeal to and approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals, be changed to another
nonconforming use of the same classification or of a less intensive
classification, or the Board shall find that the use proposed for substitution
is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing
nonconforming use.  In permitting such change, the Board may require that
additional conditions and safeguards be met, which requirements shall pertain
as stipulated conditions to the approval of such change, and failure to meet
such conditions shall be considered a punishable violation of this section. 
Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a less intensive use or
becomes a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a more
intensive use.

1153.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for issuance of conditional zoning
certificates where conditionally permitted uses are provided for in this Zoning
Ordinance.
(Ord. 109-14. Passed 6-23-14.)
1153.02  PROCEDURES FOR MAKING APPLICATION.
   Any application for a conditional zoning certificate for any land or
structure permitted under this Zoning Ordinance shall be submitted in
accordance with the following procedures:
(a)   Submission to the Planning Director.  Application for Planning Commission
action shall be submitted to the Planning Director on a special form for that
purpose.  Each application form shall be accompanied by the payment of the
required fee established in Chapter
1108 of the Planning and Zoning Code.  In addition, the Planning Commission,
where appropriate, may refer an application to qualified consultants for a
report if it deems the proposed use may require special study.  The cost of
such report shall be at the expense of the applicant, in accordance with a
policy established and amended from time to time by Council.
(b)   Data Required with Application. 
(1)   Form supplied by the Planning Commission completed by the applicant.
(2)   Site plan, plot plan or development plan of the entire property being
considered, drawn to a reasonable scale and showing the location of all
abutting streets, the location of all existing and proposed structures, the
types of buildings, their uses and the acreage or area involved, including that
for parking.
(c)   Review by Planning Commission.  The Planning Commission shall review the
proposed development, as presented on the submitted plans and specifications in
terms of the standards established in this Zoning Ordinance.  Such review by
the Planning Commission shall be completed and made public within forty-five
(45) days of the date of submission.
(d)   Hearing.  The Planning Commission shall hold a hearing or hearings upon
every application.  Notice shall be sent to all adjoining property owners and
shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation at least ten (10) days
prior to the date of the hearing.  Such notice shall indicate the place, time
and subject of the hearing.
(e)   Issuance and Revocation of Conditional Zoning Certificates; Violation. 
Only upon conclusion of hearing procedures relative to a particular
application, and adequate review and study, may the Planning Commission issue a
conditional zoning certificate.  The breach of any condition, safeguard or
requirement shall automatically invalidate the certificate granted, and shall
constitute a violation of this Zoning Ordinance.
(f)   Reapplication.  No application for a conditional zoning certificate which
has been denied wholly or in part by the Planning Commission shall be
resubmitted until the expiration of one year or more from the date of such
denial, except on grounds of newly discovered evidence or proof of changed
conditions which would be sufficient to justify reconsideration as determined
by the Planning Commission.  At the expiration of one year from the date of the
original application, each reapplication shall be accompanied by the required
fee.
(g)   Termination.  The conditional zoning certificate shall become void at the
expiration of one year after the date of issuance unless the conditionally
permitted use has commenced.

section have been formatted to provide an illustration of the preferred and not
preferred methods of building design as it relates to height, scale, massing,
setback and other issues.  For each specific guideline in the following section
a description of the recommended approach that the applicant/property owner
should "consider" is provided, with an illustration of the result of the
design.  Similarly, a description is provided of the design approach that the
applicant/property owner should "avoid" when designing or remodeling structures
in the Overlay District. 
(a)   Height.
(1)   Consider relating the overall height of new construction or renovation of
existing structures to that of adjacent structures.
 
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/a75ca8f1a2746467795e51a8b1ab4bdd472206ce/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3271.jpg]
(2)   Avoid new construction that greatly varies in height (too high or too
low) from older buildings in the vicinity.
 
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/a75ca8f1a2746467795e51a8b1ab4bdd472206ce/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3274.jpg]
(b)   Scale.
(1)   Consider relating the size and proportion of new structures to the scale
of adjacent buildings.  Although much larger than its neighbors in terms of
square footage, the building shown below maintains the same scale and rhythm as
the existing buildings.
 
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/a75ca8f1a2746467795e51a8b1ab4bdd472206ce/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3277.jpg]
(2)   Avoid buildings that in height, width or massing violate the existing
scale of the area. The new building shown here disrupts the scale and rhythm of
the streetscape.
 
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/a75ca8f1a2746467795e51a8b1ab4bdd472206ce/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3280.jpg]
   (c)   Massing.
(1)   Consider breaking up uninteresting boxlike forms into smaller, varied
masses such as are common on most older buildings.  Variety of form and massing
are elements essential to the character of the streetscape.
 
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/a75ca8f1a2746467795e51a8b1ab4bdd472206ce/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3283.jpg]
(2)   Avoid single monolithic forms that are not relieved by variations in
massing.  Boxlike facades and forms are intrusive when placed in a streetscape
of older buildings that have varied massing and façade articulation.
 
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/a75ca8f1a2746467795e51a8b1ab4bdd472206ce/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3286.jpg]
   (d)   Directional Expression.
(1)   Consider relating the vertical or non-directional façade character of new
buildings to the predominant directional expression of nearby buildings. 
Horizontal buildings can be made to relate to the more vertical adjacent
structures by breaking the façade into smaller masses that conform to the
primary expression of that streetscape.
 
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/a75ca8f1a2746467795e51a8b1ab4bdd472206ce/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3289.jpg]
(2)   Avoid strongly horizontal or vertical façade expressions unless
compatible with the character of structures in the immediate area.  The new
building shown does not relate well to either its neighbors or to the rhythm of
the streetscape because of its unbroken horizontal façade.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3292.jpg]
   (e)   Setback.
(1)   Consider maintaining the architectural façade lines of streetscape by
locating front walls of new buildings in the same plane as facades of adjacent
buildings.  If existing setbacks vary, the new building should conform to
historic siting patterns.

(2)   Avoid violating the existing setback pattern by placing new buildings in
front of or behind the historic façade line.  Avoid placing buildings at odd
angles to the street unless in an area where diverse siting already exists.

   (f)   Sense of Entry.
(1)   Consider articulating the main entrances to the building with covered
porches, porticos and other pronounced architectural forms.

(2)   Avoid facades with no strong sense of entry.  Side entries or entries not
defined by a porch or similar transitional element result in an incompatible
"flat" first floor façade.

   (g)   Roof Shapes.
(1)   Consider relating the roof forms of the new building to those found in
the area.  Although not entirely necessary, duplication of the existing or
traditional roof shapes, pitches and materials on new construction is one way
of making new structures more visually compatible.

(2)   Avoid introducing roof shapes, pitches or materials not traditionally
used in the area.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3310.jpg]
   (h)   Rhythm of Openings.
(1)   Consider respecting the recurrent alternation of wall area with door and
window elements in the façade.  Also consider the width-to-height ratio of bays
in the façade.  The placement of openings with respect to the façade's overall
composition symmetry, or balances asymmetry should be carefully studied.

(2)   Avoid introducing incompatible façade patterns that upset the rhythm of
openings established in the surrounding structures.  Glass walls and window and
door shapes and their locations shown in the examples are disrespectful to the
adjoining buildings.

1167.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to specify the procedures that shall be
followed to subdivide land.
1167.02  CLASSIFICATION AND DETERMINATION OF SUBDIVISION TYPE.
   There are two basic types of subdivisions:
   (a)    Minor Subdivision.  The City Engineer may determine that a proposed
subdivision of land is a minor subdivision if the proposed division of a parcel
of land is along an existing public street, does not involve the opening,
widening or extension of any street or road and does not involve more than five
lots after the original tract has been completely subdivided.
   (b)    Major Subdivision.  Any subdivision that does not meet the
requirements of a minor subdivision is a major subdivision.
1167.03  MINOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (a)    Staff Granted the Authority of Review and Approval.  The City
Engineer is authorized to represent the Planning Commission in the review and
approval of a minor subdivision, and to endorse the conveyance of a parcel or
parcels of land in a minor subdivision for transfer without plat.
   (b)    Submission of Minor Subdivision.  Any person proposing to create a
minor subdivision shall submit the following to the City Engineer:
      (1)    A legal description of the parcel or parcels sought to be
transferred, on a conveyance of such parcel or parcels.
      (2)    Two copies of property line survey by a registered surveyor of the
parcel or parcels sought to be transferred.
         (Ord. 143-96.  Passed 9-23-96.)
      (3)    Each application shall be accompanied by the payment of the fee
established in Chapter
1108 of the Planning and Zoning Code.  In addition, the City Engineer, where
appropriate, may refer an application to qualified consultants for a report if
the City Engineer deems the proposed use may require special study. The cost of
such report shall be at the expense of the applicant, in accordance with a
policy established and amended from time to time by Council. 
(Ord. 50-05.  Passed 2-28-05.)
   (c)    Action by the City Engineer.  Within seven working days after
submission of a minor subdivision, or within a mutually agreed upon extension,
the City Engineer shall either approve or disapprove the application for
transfer without plat. If the City Engineer does not approve the transfer
without plat, the applicant shall be notified in writing of the reason for
disapproval. If the City Engineer approves the transfer without plat, the
conveyance shall be stamped: "Approved by Medina City Planning Commission; no
plat required, " and the signature of the City Engineer shall be affixed along
with the date of such approval. The approval shall expire at the end of sixty
days, unless the conveyances are recorded in the office of the County Recorder
during such period.
   (d)    Action by the Health Commissioner.  The City Engineer shall within
seven days after submission of a minor subdivision, which would require an
individual sewer system, submit the proposed subdivision to the Health
Commissioner who shall approve or disapprove building sites for individual
sewer systems. If disapproved the Health Commissioner shall notify the owner of
the reasons for disapproval.
   (e)    Three-Mile Area.  The Planning Director is authorized to represent
the Planning Commission in the review and approval of a minor subdivision and
to endorse the conveyance of a parcel or parcels of land in a minor subdivision
for transfer without plat. Subdivision outside the City but within the City's
three-mile extraterritorial jurisdiction, shall not be approved by the Planning
Director until the survey plat is given zoning approval by the applicable
township.
1167.04  MAJOR SUBDIVISION.
   (a)    General Procedure.  Major subdivisions shall be approved in four
stages: preliminary discussion stage, preliminary plan stage, improvement plan
stage and the final plat stage.
      (1)    Preliminary discussion stage.  The preliminary discussion stage
requires the subdivider to discuss the proposed subdivision with the
appropriate agencies so that he can become familiar with subdivision
requirements, existing conditions and future plans.
      (2)    Preliminary plan stage.  The preliminary plan stage requires the
subdivider to present all information needed to enable the Commission to
determine that the proposed layout is satisfactory and will serve the public
interest. This stage also ensures that the subdivider will not be required to
expend excessive moneys without some assurance that his plat will be finally
approved.
      (3)    Improvement plan stage.  The improvement plan stage requires the
subdivider to present all the information needed to enable the City Engineer to
check the drainage areas and to determine that the storm sewers, sanitary
sewers, water lines and material proposed for street construction meet the
requirements of these Regulations and the specifications of the City Engineer.
      (4)    Final plat stage.  The final plat stage requires the subdivider to
present a complete survey plat to enable the Commission to determine that the
subdivision fully complies with these Regulations and conforms to the approved
preliminary plan and the improvement plans.
   (b)    Preliminary Discussion.  The subdivider shall consult with the
Planning Commission. He shall submit a preliminary discussion map including all
items required by Section
1169.02.  (Ord. 143-96.  Passed 9-23-96.)
   (c)    Preliminary Plan Procedure.
      (1)    Submission of preliminary plan.  The subdivider shall make
application to the Planning Commission for approval of a preliminary plan. All
information required by Section
1169.03  shall be submitted to the Planning Director. 
(Ord. 50-05.  Passed 2-28-05.)
         A.    One copies of application for preliminary approval.
         B.    Thirteen copies of the preliminary plan including a vicinity
map. (See Appendix A).
         C.    Any other data that the City Engineer deems necessary.
            (Ord. 143-96.  Passed 9-23-96.)
         D.    Each application shall be accompanied by the payment of the fee
established in Chapter
1108 of the Planning and Zoning Code.  In addition, the Planning Commission,
where appropriate, may refer an application to qualified consultants for a
report if the Planning Commission deems the proposed use may require special
study.  The cost of such report shall be at the expense of the applicant, in
accordance with a policy established and amended from time to time by Council. 
(Ord. 50-05.  Passed 2-28-05.)
      (2)    Planning Commission action.  The Planning Commission within forty-
five days of the date of official filing shall approve, approve conditionally
or disapprove the preliminary plan. The action shall be noted on both the
preliminary plan and the preliminary plan application form, and a copy of each
returned to the subdivider. The action shall also be entered on the official
records of the Commission, and a copy of the preliminary plan with action noted
kept on file.
      (3)    Effect of approval.  Approval of a preliminary plan by the
Planning Commission is not an acceptance of the subdivision for record. It is
an approval of a general plan as a guide for the preparation of improvement
plans and a subdivision plat for final approval and recording upon fulfillment
of all requirements of these Regulations. Approval of a preliminary plan shall
be effective for a period of one year following the date of approval by the
Planning Commission, unless an extension of time is granted. Upon expiration of
a preliminary plan approval, no approval of a final plat shall be given until
the preliminary plan has been resubmitted and approved. Construction of
improvements shall not begin until action on the final plat has been taken.
   (d)    Improvement Plan Procedure.  The developer's engineer shall prepare
improvement plans which include all phases of the work to be performed to make
the land suitable for development into the use proposed. These plans shall be
complete and precise in all details and be submitted to and approved by the
City Engineer before any improvements are constructed. As part of this
submission the developer shall provide evidence that the following approvals
have been received:
      (1)   Wetlands approval letter from the Army Corp of Engineers.
      (2)   Water system extension approval by Ohio EPA.
      (3)   Erosion control plan approved by Medina County Soil & Water
Conservation Service.
         (Ord. 143-96.  Passed 9-23-96.)
   (e)    Final Plat Procedure.
      (1)    Submission of final plat.  The subdivider shall make application
to the Planning Commission for approval of a final plat. The final plat
submitted shall conform to the approved preliminary plan. Subdivisions may be
submitted for final approval in consecutive sections, provided that preliminary
plan and improvement plan approval have been given for the entire subdivision.
All items as required by Section
1169.05 shall be submitted to the City Engineer as follows:
         (Ord. 50-05.  Passed 2-28-05.)
         A.    One copy of the application for final plat approval.
         B.    One copy of restrictive covenants pertaining to the site.
         C.    Original tracing and two copies of final plat and vicinity map.
         D.    Three copies of approved improvement plans.
            (Ord. 143-96.  Passed 9-23-96.)
         E.    Each application shall be accompanied by the payment of the fee
established in Chapter
1108 of the Planning and Zoning Code.  In addition, the Planning Commission,
where appropriate, may refer an application to qualified consultants for a
report if the Planning Commission deems the proposed use may require special
study.  The cost of such report shall be at the expense of the applicant, in
accordance with a policy established and amended from time to time by Council. 
(Ord. 50-05.  Passed 2-28-05.)
         F.    One copy of financial guarantees and insurance approved by the
Law Director and Finance Director in an amount stated by the City Engineer (see
Section
1173.08 ).
         G.    The City Engineer may request additional copies of any of the
above items and any other additional information deemed necessary. Within five
working days of the date of submission, the City Engineer shall determine if
all the items as required by Section
1169.05  have been submitted. If all the required items have not been
submitted, the City Engineer shall notify the subdivider of such omissions.
      (2)    Official filing of final plat.  The City Engineer shall present to
the Planning Commission the final plat documents, which meet the requirements
of Section
1169.05 , at the next meeting after all required documents have been submitted.
Upon determination by the Planning Commission that the final plat has been
properly submitted, the Commission shall accept the final plat as being
officially filed and shall certify on the copies the date of acceptance.
      (3)    Planning Commission action.  The Planning Commission shall approve
or disapprove the plat within forty-five days from the date of official filing
or within a mutually agreed upon time extension; otherwise the final plat shall
be deemed to have been approved. One of the following actions shall be taken by
the Planning Commission;
         A.    Final approval.  The Planning Commission may give final approval
before all required improvements are installed, authorizing its chairman to
sign the plat at such time as a construction agreement and a performance
guarantee (refer to Section
1173.08 (e)), acceptable to the Law Director and City Engineer, are provided
for the purpose of assuring installation of such improvements. The amount of
such performance guarantee shall be sufficient to cover the cost of all
improvements, based upon an estimate prepared by the subdivider’s consulting
engineer and approved by the City Engineer. For the purpose of satisfying the
performance guarantee requirement of this section, it shall be sufficient for
the subdivider to submit the guarantee of a solvent bank or other financial
institution that funds in the amount of the performance guarantee requirement
have been committed to the installation of such improvements, in accordance
with Ohio R.C. 1151.298, and that such funds will be disbursed by such bank or
financial institution with the prior approval of the City Engineer. Upon
receipt of the City Engineer's certification and determination that all the
requirements of these Regulations have been met, the Planning Commission may
give final approval and shall indicate such approval and date on the tracing of
the final plat. The final plan shall then be submitted to Council for approval.
A two-thirds vote of Council shall be required to override the recommendation
of the Planning Commission. Council shall endorse the subdivision by affixing
the Clerk of Council's signature to the tracing of the final plat.
         B.    Disapproval.  Should the Planning Commission determine to
disapprove the final plat, written notice of such action, including reference
to the regulations or regulation violated by the plat, shall be mailed to the
subdivider. The action shall also be entered on the official records of the
Commission.
         C.    Approval without Commission action.  In the event the Planning
Commission fails to approve or disapprove the final plat within forty-five days
from the date of its official filing, or within a mutually agreed upon time
extension, the final plat shall be deemed to have been approved.
      (4)    Effect of approval.  Final approval of a plat by the Planning
Commission shall not be an acceptance by the public of the offer of dedication
of any street, highway or other public ways or open space upon the plat unless
such acceptance is also endorsed by Council upon the tracing of the final plat.
      (5)    Recording of final plat.  After final approval of a plat by the
Planning Commission the subdivider shall deliver the tracing of such plat to
the City Engineer, who after rechecking and assigning a City lot number shall
secure approval of the Tax Map Department. The City Engineer shall then present
the plat to the County Auditor for transfer and to the County Recorder for
recording. All fees required in connection with the above process as well as
costs of reproductions of such plat shall be paid by the subdivider. Upon
recording of the final plat, a copy of the plat shall be permanently retained
by the Planning Commission and filed with the City Engineer.

Design Standards
1171.01   Physical considerations.
1171.02   Streets.
1171.03   Easements.
1171.04   Blocks.
1171.05   Lots.
1171.06   Public sites and open space.
1171.07   Conformity with Land Use and Thoroughfare Plan.
 
1171.01  PHYSICAL CONSIDERATIONS.
   (a)    Natural Land Use.  Subdivisions should be planned to take advantage
of the topography of the land to economize in the construction of drainage
facilities, to reduce the amount of grading and to minimize destruction of
trees and topsoil.
   (b)    Flood Hazard.  If any portion of the land within the subdivision or
other proposed new development is subject to flooding or other hazards, due
consideration shall be given to such problems in the design of the subdivision.
All subdivision proposals and other proposed new development shall be reviewed
to assure that:
      (1)    All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage;
      (2)    All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems are located, elevated and constructed to minimize
flood damage; and
      (3)    Adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood
hazards. Land subject to flooding and land otherwise uninhabitable shall not be
platted for residential occupancy nor for such other uses that may increase
danger to health, life or property, or aggravate the flood hazard.
1171.02 STREETS.
   (a)    Arrangement.  The arrangement, character, extent, width and location
of all streets shall conform to the locally adopted Land Use and Thoroughfare
Plan. The design of proposed streets shall provide for both the continuation of
existing streets and access to adjacent unplatted lands, so that the entire
area can be served with a coordinated street system.
   (b)    Classifications.
      (1)    Major arterial thoroughfares shall be planned for continuation of
movement of fast traffic between points of heavy traffic generation and from
one section of the community to another. They shall contain as few
intersections with minor streets as possible. Such thoroughfares should
traverse the community and be spaced approximately one mile apart.
      (2)    Collector streets shall provide a traffic route from local streets
to major arterial thoroughfares. These streets should be spaced at least one-
fourth mile apart.
      (3)    Local streets shall provide direct and full access to each lot and
shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.
      (4)    Cul-de-sac streets are permitted in a residential area to
discourage through traffic and promote public safety. Such streets should not
be greater than 600 feet in length except where existing topographic conditions
discourage the use of an alternate street pattern. Cul-de-sac streets shall
normally have a sixty-foot right of way terminating in a turnaround having a
minimum outside paving radius of fifty feet and a property line radius not less
than sixty feet.
      (5)    Parallel streets may be required along an existing or proposed
major arterial thoroughfare to provide access to lots along such major arterial
thoroughfares.
      (6)    Service drives shall be designed to provide only secondary access.
   (c)    Street Right-of-Way Widths and Grades.
 
Street Classification       Minimum R-O-W  width (in feet)Grades (by percent)
                                                           Maximum Minimum

Service drives              30                             8       .5
   (d)    Half Streets.  Half streets shall be prohibited except where there is
an existing half street adjacent to the subdivision, in which case the
remaining half of the street shall be platted.
   (e)    Temporary Turnaround and Dead-End Streets.  If such a street is of a
temporary nature and a future extension into adjacent land is anticipated, then
the turning circle beyond the normal street width shall be in the nature of an
easement over the premises included in such turning circle, but beyond the
boundaries of the street proper. Such easements shall be automatically vacated
to abutting property owners, when the dead-end street is legally extended into
adjacent land. If such dead-end street extends only one lot depth past a street
intersection, no turnaround will be required.
   (f)   Horizontal and Vertical Curves.  Angles in the alignment of street
lines shall be connected by a curve with a radius on the center line of not
less than 200 feet for local streets, 300 feet for collector and industrial
streets and 500 feet for major arterial thoroughfares. Between reverse curves
there shall be a tangent at least 100 feet long on major arterial
thoroughfares. Every change in street grade shall be made with a vertical curve
to provide distance suited to the location, which in no case shall be less than
300 feet from a height of four and one-half feet.
   (g)    Intersections.  Streets shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles, and no street shall intersect any other street at an
angle of less than seventy-five degrees. In no event shall an intersection
containing streets in excess of four be approved.
   (h)    Street Jogs.  Street jogs with center line offsets of less than 125
feet shall be prohibited. If deemed necessary by the Planning Commission, the
minimum distance between center line offsets may be increased.
1171.03  EASEMENTS.
   Where a subdivision is traversed by a drainage way, a storm water or
drainage easement conforming substantially with the lines of such drainage way
shall be provided. The easement shall be fifteen (15) feet wide or shall
generally  be centered upon, rear and side lot lines. Where deemed necessary by
the City Engineer, a wider easement may be required.
1171.04  BLOCKS.
   (a)    Residential Block Lengths.  For residential block lengths inside the
City the long dimension of a residential block shall not exceed eight hundred
feet. For residential block lengths outside the City, but within the three-mile
extraterritorial jurisdiction the long dimension of a residential block shall
conform to the standards of the Medina County Subdivision Regulations. The
Planning Commission may approve a longer block length if topographic or other
conditions warrant.
   (b)    Pedestrian Walkways.  Pedestrian walkways, with not less than ten
feet right of way, or of such greater width as deemed necessary by the Planning
Commission, shall be required across blocks where the Planning Commission deems
that pedestrian access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers,
transportation and other community facilities is necessary.
   (c)    Commercial or Industrial Blocks.  Blocks intended to be used for
commercial or industrial purposes shall be designed specifically for such uses
with adequate space set aside for off-street parking and loading facilities.
1171.05  LOTS.
   (a)    Zoning Conformance.  The lot size, width, depth and the minimum
building setback shall conform to the applicable zoning requirements.
   (b)    Corner Lots.  A lot at the junction of and abutting upon two
intersecting streets is a corner lot.
   (c)    Access to Public Streets.  The subdividing of land shall provide each
lot with access to an existing public street.
   (d)    Double Frontage Lot.  Lots shall not be laid out so that they have
frontage on more than one street except:
      (1)    Where the lots are adjacent to the intersection of two streets;
      (2)    Where it is necessary to separate residential lots from major
arterial thoroughfares. Where double frontage lots are created adjacent to
major arterial thoroughfares, a reserve strip along the major arterial
thoroughfare shall be deeded to the City. The plat shall state that there shall
be no right of access across such reserve strip. The Planning Commission may
require that a six-foot high solid board fence or masonry wall be constructed
or that a ten-foot wide planting screen be provided.
   (e)    Lot Lines.  Lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or
radial to street lines. Lot lines should follow Municipal, Township and County
boundary lines rather than cross them, insofar as possible.
   (f)    Lot Depth.  Lot depth shall not exceed three and one-half times the
lot width, except as otherwise authorized by the Planning Commission. In the
three-mile extraterritorial area designated for residential development with no
more than one dwelling unit per two gross acres, lot depth shall be limited
only by consideration of interference with planned streets or the block
criteria specified in Section
1171.04 (a).
1171.06  PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACE.
   (a)    Public Facilities.  The design of the subdivision shall provide for
parks, playgrounds, schools and other sites for public use. Such public
facilities shall conform to the adopted Land Use and Thoroughfare Plan.
   (b)    Natural Features.  Due consideration shall be given to preserving
outstanding natural features such as scenic spots, water bodies or
exceptionally fine groves of trees. Dedication to and acceptance by a public
agency is usually the best means of assuring their preservation.
1171.07  CONFORMITY WITH LAND USE AND THOROUGHFARE PLAN.
   All proposed subdivisions shall substantially conform to the adopted Land
Use and Thoroughfare Plan where not in conflict with an official zoning
ordinance. Wherever a tract to be subdivided embraces a part of a proposed
major thoroughfare or collector street, such part of the proposed public way
shall be platted by the subdivider in the location and of the width indicated
on the Land Use and Thoroughfare Plan.

1173.02  GRADING AND DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENTS.
   A drainage system shall be designed and constructed by the subdivider to
provide for the proper drainage of the surface water of the subdivision and the
drainage area of which it is a part. To this end the subdivision shall be
graded as required by Section
1173.01, Table 1, and the following requirements and methods shall be followed:
   (a)    Drainage Plan.  Prior to the start of any construction of streets,
the subdivider shall furnish a plot plan showing the slab or floor elevation of
each house proposed to be constructed. He shall also show by the use of arrows
how he proposes to surface drain each lot. The subdivider shall submit
topographic maps showing the area to be drained with calculations prepared by a
registered professional engineer in determining the proposed storm water
collection system.
   (b)    Drainage Requirements: Grading. No final grading, sidewalk or
pavement construction or installation of utilities shall be permitted in any
proposed street until the final plat has been approved or conditionally
approved. The subdivider shall grade each subdivision as specified in Section
1173.01 , Table 1, in order to establish street, block and lot grades in proper
relation to each other to topography as follows:
      (1)    Street grading plan.  A grading plan shall be prepared for the
streets along with street improvement details. The grading of the roadway shall
extend the full width of the right of way. Planting strips shall be graded at a
gradient of one-half inch (½”) per foot from the curb to the sidewalk or
property line.
      (2)    Block and lot grading.
         A.    Block grading shall be as follows: drainage into the streets or
as specified by the City Engineer.
         B.    Lot grading shall be as follows: lots shall be graded so that
water drains away from each building at a minimum grade of two percent. Surface
drainage swales shall have a minimum grade of one percent (1%) and shall be
designed so that surface water will drain into a driveway, street gutter, storm
sewer, drain inlet or natural drainage way. The minimum grade of driveways
shall be a minimum of four-tenths percent and a maximum of ten percent.
         C.    Engineered fill.  All areas within the street right-of-way as
well as all areas within the building area.,i.e., between the right-of-way line
and the rear setback line of each lot, requiring fill, must first be completely
stripped of all topsoil and vegetation prior to the placement of any fill. 
Additionally, all fill in these areas must be placed in accordance with the
compacted fill specifications specified by the City Engineer.
      (3)    Topsoil.  If grading results in the stripping of topsoil, the
topsoil shall not be removed from the site or used as fill, but shall be saved
and uniformly spread over the lots as grading is finished.
      (4)    Trees.  As many trees as can be reasonably utilized in the final
development plan shall be retained and the grading adjusted to the existing
grade at the trees at the drip line.
   (c)    Drainage System Requirements.  Grading of the subdivision, the road
drainage system, and Off-road drainage systems shall be done with regard to the
natural drainage of the area involved, and open ditches, conduits, catch
basins, inlets and manholes of adequate size shall be constructed to provide
for such drainage. The design criteria for the drainage systems shall be as
approved by the City Engineer based on the Medina County Storm Water Management
and Sediment Control Rules and Regulations.
      (1)    All watercourses or ditches with a design capacity not exceeding
the capacity of a thirty-six inch concrete pipe shall be enclosed. Existing
creeks or ditches constructed by the subdivider which exceed the above limit
shall be constructed with a minimum fifteen-foot wide continuous earth roadway
to provide access for maintenance equipment to all sections of the ditch. The
ditch easement shall be wide enough to contain ditch slopes and roadway with
ample clearance for the operation of maintenance equipment. Open ditches will
have a side slope ratio of two to one and a minimum of a two-foot bottom width.
      (2)    No open ditch shall be constructed within 100 feet of the rear of
a house, as measured from the house to the edge of the ditch easement.
      (3)    Any storm drainage courses carried along side lot lines shall be
enclosed with approved pipe.
      (4)    Easements for drainage purposes shall be a minimum of fifteen feet
in width. Where the watercourse is larger ( including retention and detention
basins), easement widths shall be increased as determined by the City Engineer
including any access easements. (See subsection (c)(2) hereof). Where
watercourses cross plotted lots diagonally, the subdivider shall straighten
such courses where practicable and shall substantially follow sublot lines.
Easements shall be shown on the record plat and deeds and shall cover all
existing or reconstructed watercourses.
   (d)    Protection of Drainage Systems.  The subdivider shall adequately
protect all ditches (roadways and watercourses) to the satisfaction of the City
Engineer as follows:
      (1)    Any watercourse having a gradient in excess of two and one-half
percent shall be enclosed with pipe with the necessary inlets and shall be
piped to a storm sewer, if nearby, or otherwise to a natural watercourse. Where
a street is of considerable length and of various gradients, a part of which
requires storm sewers, the lengths between the storm sewers, even though less
than two and one-half percent gradient, shall also be enclosed in pipe, when
required by the City Engineer. Material and construction shall be in accordance
with the specifications of the City Engineer. Watercourses or road gutters
having a gradient of less than two and one-half percent but more than one and
one-half percent shall be sodded or paved with brick, concrete, half tile or
broken concrete slabs. All areas within the right of way not paved or sodded
shall be fertilized and seeded.
      (2)    All adjoining land where the vegetation has been injured or
destroyed or where the land is in need of protection to prevent erosion,
deposits in the drainage facilities and/or unsightly conditions shall be
restored and protected as directed by the City Engineer.
      (3)    In all cases, any drainage facilities within the subdivision shall
be in a stable condition, free from either erosion or sedimentation and/or
other debris.

Classifications are controlled by width  and strength specifications. No street
in any new subdivision shall be classified lower than Type A, Class II for
paving purposes. After the underground utilities and house connections are
installed and rough grading completed, the roadway subgrade shall be shaped,
rolled and compacted. The subdivider may construct a temporary roadway of slag
or stone for use during the building construction period. Such pavements shall
be maintained in a safe and passable condition by the subdivider without
expense to the City.
      (1)    Width:
         A.    Type “A” Streets. In all streets, or sections of streets in the

in excess of the size needed to serve the proposed subdivision are necessary,
the subdivider shall install all improvements required to serve his subdivision
plus the additional oversize and/or off-site improvements required. The
subdivider may contract with adjacent property owners and/or subdividers of
adjacent land for reimbursement of the oversize and/or off-site improvements
required. Such improvements shall be available for connections by individual
property owners and/or subdividers of adjoining land.
1173.07  CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    Preconstruction Meeting and Work Schedule.  A preconstruction meeting
will be held with the City Engineer prior to the commencement of any project.

inspection may extend to all or any part of the work and to the preparation,
fabrication or manufacture of the materials to be used. The inspector shall not
be authorized to revoke, alter or waive any requirements of the specifications
or plans. He shall be authorized to call to the attention of the contractor any
failure of the work or materials to conform to the specifications and contract.
He shall have the authority to reject materials which do not meet specification
requirements or suspend the portion of the work involved until any question at
issue can be referred to and decided by the City Engineer. Inspection during
the installation of improvements shall be made by the inspector to insure
conformity with the approved plans and specifications as contained in the
subdivider's construction agreement. (See Section
1165.05 (b) for fees).
          (3)    Final inspection.  Upon completion of all the improvements,
the subdivider shall request in writing a final inspection by the City
Engineer. The City Engineer shall make a final inspection of improvements.
   (c)    Construction Responsibilities.
      (1)    Cooperation of subdivider and/or contractor.  The subdivider and/
or contractor shall have available on the project, at all times, two approved
copies of all required plans and specifications. He shall cooperate with the
inspector and with other contractors in every way possible. The subdivider and/
or contractor shall at all times have a competent superintendent acting as his
agent on the project. The superintendent shall be capable of reading and
thoroughly understanding the plans and specifications. He shall have full
authority to execute the plans and specifications and to promptly supply such
materials, tools, plant equipment and labor as may be required. A
superintendent shall be furnished irrespective of the amount of work sublet.
      (2)    Work schedules.  The subdivider and/or contractor shall submit
weekly work schedules every Friday for the following week's work. Work which
has not properly been scheduled shall not be accepted by the City Engineer. All
work schedules must be inspected and approved by the City inspectors.
Unsatisfactory progress reports will be returned for revision. The normal work
week is assumed to be an eight-hour day, Monday through Friday; if overtime

          (3)    Grade stakes.  Pavement and pipe grade stakes shall be set at
twenty-five foot intervals on horizontal and vertical curves and for all grades
less than one percent. Tangent pavement grades and pipe grades over one percent
may be set at a maximum interval of fifty feet. Stakes shall be protected until
their use is no longer needed. After the rough grading for the streets and
utilities has been completed, the owner's engineers shall set a new set of line
and grade stakes for the pavement. Stakes shall be set at a maximum of ten feet
from the edge of the pavement, and at a maximum of twenty-five foot intervals
on vertical and horizontal curves, and at a maximum of fifty foot intervals on

neat and presentable condition satisfactory to the inspector.
          (6)    Maintenance of improvements of dedicated streets.  The
subdivider shall be responsible for the maintenance of the improvements during
the construction period and shall be responsible for providing the services
necessary to guarantee access to all occupied lots, until final acceptance of
the improvements by the City Engineer. The subdivider shall be notified by the
City Engineer of the need for maintenance or service. If the subdivider fails
to perform such necessary maintenance or service within a time specified by the
City Engineer, the City may perform maintenance or service and bill the
subdivider for such service. Payment shall be guaranteed by the performance
bond. In addition, the subdivider shall maintain all improvements for such
periods specified in Section
1173.08(e).
          (7)    City services.  Services customarily rendered by the City to
the residents thereof, such as garbage collections, snow removal and fire
protection, will not be done by the City until the paving is completed. The
owner shall so inform all prospective buyers by the erection of signs in
conspicuous places at all entrances to the subdivision. Signs shall be not less
than four square feet in area, with two-inch lettering. The furnishing of such
services within the subdivision shall in no way obligate the City in the matter
of maintenance of the pavement or any of the utilities until the expiration of
the eighteen-month maintenance period as defined in Section
1173.08(e).
1173.08  AGREEMENTS AND GUARANTEES.
   All bonds, insurance and other financial guarantees required under this
section shall be secured from companies authorized to do business in the State,
and shall be deposited and remain at all times with the City Finance Director.
   (a)    Plan Checking and Field Inspection.  Prior to the commencement of
Construction,  the subdivider shall deposit an amount of money equal to the
estimated cost of plan checking and field inspection. All work done by the
Engineer in connection with checking, computing and correcting such plans for
improvements, all Ohio Edison street light connection fees, and all street name
sign installation fees and all other applicable fees directly related to the
review, inspection and/or installation of subdivision improvements, shall be
charged against such deposit. If, during the progress of the work, the cost
thereof appears to exceed the amount so deposited, the Engineer shall notify
the subdivider of this fact and shall do no further work in connection with
such review until the subdivider has deposited such additional sum of money
determined necessary by the Engineer to cover the cost of the work. The
subdivider shall also pay to the Office of the Finance Director an amount fixed
by City Council per man hour for field inspection of the improvements. The
estimated inspection fees shall be determined by the Engineer. The subdivider
is held responsible for all of the above listed fees. The performance bond
posted by the subdivider guarantees the payment of all of the above listed
fees, and no bonds will be released until all inspection fees have been paid in
full.
   (b)    Insurance.  The owner shall save the City, its officers and agents
harmless from all claims of any nature whatsoever by any person, firm or
corporation, either for damages to person or to property, arising out of the
carrying out of the work, and/or from liability from all claims relating to
labor or material furnished for the entire work and material used in
constructing the improvements. The owner shall, prior to recording of the
record plat, furnish the City with evidence of paid-up insurance for the
protection of himself and the City that provides public liability insurance and
automobile insurance in the following minimum amounts and coverages:
 
 
Bodily injury, each person      $1,000,000
Bodily injury, each occurrence: $2,000,000
Property damage, each accident: $250,000
Property damage,  aggregate:   $500,000
   (c)    Construction Agreement.  To assure construction and installation of
improvements required by these Regulations, the subdivider shall execute a
construction agreement with the City in form and substance as determined by the
City Engineer and approved by the Law Director. This agreement shall provide
that all such improvements shall be constructed and installed at the
subdivider's expense in compliance with the standards and specifications for
each of the various types of improvements; such improvements shall be available
to and for the benefit of the lands within such subdivision; such improvements
will be completed and installed within the time for completion as set forth in
the ordinance approving the record plat. Any further provisions that the Law
Director may deem necessary to the public interest may be added, including the
right to request surveys, resurveys, title searches or liquidated damage
clauses. The construction agreement shall further provide that, if the
improvements are not completed within the specified time, the City, upon proper
notice, may complete the improvements and recover full costs and expenses
thereof from the subdivider and may appropriate each portion of money or bonds
posted for the faithful performance of such works.  Prior to Council accepting
this Construction Agreement, the subdivider must submit a Performance Guarantee
(refer to Section
1173.08 (e)).
   (d)    Commencement of Improvements.  No construction of any improvements or
clearing, grubbing and grading shall be commenced prior to the approval of the
construction agreement by Council.
   (e)    Performance Guarantee.
      (1)    Type of guarantee.  The subdivider, when requesting Council's
approval of the Construction agreement and/or the record plat,  shall execute
and file with the Finance Director the construction agreement provided for
herein, and also shall file with the Finance Director a full construction
letter of credit in an amount equal to the estimated cost of all the
improvements which he has agreed to build and install, plus an additional five
percent of such cost. The additional amount shall provide for any margin of
error in estimation and shall also be available to the City to offset increased
construction costs and administrative costs which the City may incur if it is
forced to complete the improvements under the forfeiture provisions hereof. The
subdivider’s engineer shall prepare a cost estimate and submit it to the City
Engineer for approval. The letter of credit shall specifically stipulate that
all draw requests must be approved in advance by the City Engineer. 
Additionally, the letter of credit becomes null and void only after the City
Engineer certifies the completion of the work.  Finally, the letter of credit
must specifically state that the City may draw upon this letter of credit to
complete any improvements not completed by the subdivider within the specific
time periods established herein.  The form of the letter of credit must be
approved by the Finance Director and the Law Director.  An example of an
acceptable letter of credit can be found in the appendix of this section.
      (2)    Term of guarantee.  The letter of credit shall be for a period of
time at least one year longer than the time in which the subdivider is to
complete his improvements. In the case of a surety bond, it shall provide that
no reasonable extension of time granted the subdivider by the City shall act as
a release of the surety or sureties. 
   (f)    Final Inspection.  Upon completion of all the various items of work,
the subdivider may apply to the City for final inspection. If the City finds
that all installations meet the requirements of the approved plans and
specifications, and the same are approved and accepted by the City Engineer,
then the performance bond may be discharged, provided that the subdivider has
first posted his maintenance bond as provided for herein. All items found to be
not acceptable by the City Engineer at the time of the final inspection must be
corrected prior to the issuance of any building permits. The subdivider will
not be allowed to apply for any building permits within the subject subdivision
until all improvements (excepting sidewalks) have been completed to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer and all required submittals have been
forwarded to and approved by the City Engineer.
   (g)    Maintenance Guarantees.  A cash maintenance bond or a corporate
surety bond shall be posted with the City in the amount of ten percent of the
cost of improvements and shall be arranged for a period of 24 months from the
date of final inspection and approval of improvements by the City Engineer. The
bond shall be subject to approval by the Finance Director and the Law Director.
The subdivider shall be responsible for routine maintenance of all improvements
within twenty-four months, and shall repair all failures due to faulty
construction as soon as they become apparent. The subdivider shall also make
repairs due to erosion or abuse by utility companies and shall repair all
failures for all other reasons during the maintenance guarantee period. The
streets and other improvements shall be in a condition acceptable to the City
Engineer at the end of the maintenance period. If the subdivider fails to
perform such maintenance to the complete satisfaction of the City Engineer, the
City Engineer may use such cash maintenance guarantee to complete the required
improvements.
   (h)    Bond Release.  At the termination of the twenty-four month
maintenance period the subdivider may apply to the City for an inspection of
the various items of work. Before the inspection is made the subdivider shall
cause the sanitary sewers, storm sewers and the surface of the pavement and
walk to be cleaned. The City shall require the replacement of any defective
work or materials, or of any walk that has been damaged within the twenty-four
month maintenance period. When the City finds that any defects in workmanship
or materials which might have developed within the twenty-four month
maintenance period have been properly corrected and that other obligations of
the bond have been satisfied, it shall notify the subdivider that the bond may
be released, and the City shall assume all maintenance thereafter.
     (i)    Bond Forfeited. If the improvements are not completed as proposed
within the time limit that was established in the acceptance ordinance, or an
extended time period approved by Council, the performance bond shall be
forfeited and the money shall be collected by the City and used to complete the
specified improvements. The money that is collected from the bond shall be used
for no other purpose, except that the City may charge ten percent in addition
to the cost of the improvements for administrative overhead. Any money
remaining after the completion of the work shall be returned to the original
depositor. If at the termination of the eighteen-month maintenance period the
subdivider fails to make the repairs, corrections or improvements which are
ascertained by the City Engineer, then the City may declare the bond and use
the proceeds to make repairs and corrections necessary and to perform the
maintenance required of the subdivider. The money so collected shall be used
for no other purpose except that the City may charge ten percent in addition to
the cost of the repairs, corrections or maintenance to offset administrative
overhead, and any remaining funds shall be returned to the original depositor.
   (j)    Miscellaneous.  The guarantees for performance and maintenance
provided for herein may be combined in a single document or instrument so long
as the obligations are clearly stated and the City is not prejudiced by
combining them. Any such combination bond must be approved by the Law Director.
At any time during the existence of the performance or maintenance obligations,
the subdivider may exchange one form of guarantee for another so long as the
City is not thereby prejudiced. Any application for such a substitution must
first have the approval of the Law Director.

notice on its posting the Chief Building Official shall revoke the permit in
the manner set forth above. When work

1311.08  SAFETY FROM FLOODING.
   (a)    Definitions. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used
in this section shall be interpreted so as to give them the same meaning as
they have in common usage and so as to give this section its most reasonable
application.
(1)    "Base flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.
(2)    "Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations.
(3)    "Flood" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from: A. The overflow of inland or tidal
waters. B. The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
(4)    "Flood plain" or "flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to
being inundated by water from any source (see definition of "flood").
(5)    "Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural
additions, changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood
damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
(6)    "Habitable floor" means any floor usable for living purposes which
includes working, sleeping, eating, cooking or recreation, or a combination
thereof. A floor used only for storage purposes is not a "habitable floor".
(7)    "Mobile home" means a structure transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. It does not
include recreational vehicles or travel trailers. The term includes but is not
limited to the definition of "mobile home" as set forth in regulations
governing the Mobile Home Safety and Construction Standards Program (24 CFR
3282. 7(a)).
(8)    "Person" includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association or any other entity, including State and local
governments and agencies.
(9)    "Riverine" means relating to, formed by or resembling a river, including
tributaries, stream, brook, etc.
(10)    "Structure" means for flood plain management purposes, a walled and
roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally
above ground, as well as a mobile home.
(11)   "Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction or
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
of the market value of the structure either:
A.    Before the improvement or repair is started; or
B.    If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the
damage occurred.
   For the purposes of this definition "substantial improvement" is considered
to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other
structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however,
include either:
1.    Any project for health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are
solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
2.    Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic
Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.
(12)    "Variance" means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a
flood plain management regulation.
 
   (b)    The following measures shall be required within Zone A of the Flood
Hazard Boundary Map issued by the Federal Insurance Administration for this
community:
(1)    Permit requirements. No person shall erect, construct, enlarge, alter,
repair, improve, move or demolish any building or structure without first
obtaining a separate permit for each building or structure from the designated
responsible person.
   No man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not
limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading,
paving, excavation or drilling operations, shall be commenced until a separate
permit has been obtained from the designated responsible person for each
change.
   No mobile home shall be placed on improved or unimproved real estate without
first obtaining a separate permit for each mobile home from the designated
responsible person.
(2)    Application. To obtain a permit the applicant shall first file a permit
application on a form which shall be available and furnished for that purpose.
The form must be completed and submitted to the designated responsible person
together with any fee that may from time to time, be required according to law
before the issuance of a permit will be considered.
(3)    Review of applications. The City Engineer, hereinafter referred to as
the "responsible person", is appointed as the person responsible for receiving
applications and examining the plans and specifications for the proposed
construction or development. After reviewing the application, the responsible
person shall require any additional measures which are necessary to meet the
minimum requirements of this section.
(4)    The responsible person shall review proposed development to assure that
all necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies from
which approval is required by federal or State law, including Section 404 of
the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U. S. C. 1334.
(5)    The responsible person shall review all permit applications to determine
whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and
substantial improvements, including the placement of prefabricated buildings
and mobile homes, shall:
A.    Be designed, or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement of the structure;

1341.01  GRADING AND EXCAVATING .
   (a)    Grading and Filling.  The owner of any lot or land may grade or
improve the surface of the lot or land to correspond with the established grade
of the street, by filling the lot so the surface is above the established grade
of the street or alley upon which the lot or land abuts or by grading the lot
or land so the surface is below the established grade of the street or alley
upon which a lot or land abuts provided approval is granted by the City
Engineer. When the lot or land is so graded or improved, the owner shall, at
his own expense, build retaining walls, foundations or swales as may be
required by the City Engineer to safely protect his land, and any adjoining
lots or structures erected thereon. Retaining walls shall comply with the
requirements of Section
1341.03  and
1341.01 (b)(3).
      
        (b)    Excavations.
      (1)    The owner of any lot or land performing any excavation shall, at
his own expense, properly guard and protect the same to prevent the excavation
from being or becoming dangerous to life, limb or property. Excavations shall
conform to all applicable requirements of OSHA Codes for excavations.
      (2)    Any person making an excavation below the established grade shall
take measures to prevent the adjoining soil from falling in.
      (3)    When a permanent excavation is made on any lot, the person or
persons making the excavation shall build a retaining wall to give lateral
support to the earth. The retaining wall shall be carried to the height of the
established grade and be properly protected by a coping and a guardrail.
Guardrails are not required when the height difference between corresponding
grades is less than 30 inches.  Guardrails shall be a minimum of 42 inches high
with intermediate rails spaced so as not to allow the passage of a four inch
sphere. Guardrails shall be designed and constructed for a concentrated load of
200 pounds applied at any point and in any direction along the top railing
member.
   (c)   Right of Entry for Adjoining Owners.
      (1)   If anyone performing work required under this section is refused
the right to enter upon the land where an excavation is being made, as far as
may be required to perform the work, the person making the excavation shall
build foundations as required to make the wall or structure as safe as before
such excavation was commenced.
      (2)   If permission to enter the adjoining building or upon the adjoining
land, to perform work required under this section is not accorded the person
making the excavation, the owner refusing to grant permission shall make the
adjoining or contiguous wall or structure safe, support it without delay by
proper foundations, or take other required precautions so the excavation may be
made. When necessary for that purpose, the adjoining owner shall be permitted
to enter upon the premises where the excavation is being made.
      (3)   In the conditions stated in subsections (a) or (b) hereof, the
person accorded the right of entry shall perform the necessary work as promptly
as possible with the least reasonable inconvenience to the grantor of the
right.
   (d)   Emergency Precautions.  If the person, whose duty it is to preserve or
protect any wall or structure from injury, fails to do so after receiving
notice, the Chief Building Official may enter the premises and employ labor,
furnish material and take steps as, in his judgment, are necessary to make the
premises safe, or to prevent the premises from becoming unsafe or dangerous, at
the expense of the person whose duty it is to keep the same safe.
   The party doing the work, or any part thereof, under direction of the Chief
Building Official, may bring and maintain an action against the person whose
duty it is to perform such work, to recover the value of the work done and the
materials furnished in and about the premises in the same manner as if employed
to do the work by the responsible person.
   (e)   Compliance Required.  All grading, excavating or filling operations
shall comply with applicable rules and regulations of other departments and
agencies, and with other  ordinances or laws pertaining thereto.  (Ord. 142-
96.  Passed 9-23-96.)

ground grade on an adjacent property, the owner of the lot shall provide
suitable slopes, retaining walls or other protection on his property to
preserve the natural slope or surface elevation of the adjacent property.
Maximum slope shall be not greater than fourteen percent, unless approval is
obtained from the City Engineer.
   (d)   Roof  and Footer Drains.  Roof drainage shall be handled by suitable
collectors and downspouts, which must discharge into storm sewers when
available. If storm sewers are not available, downspouts must discharge on
suitable splash blocks to conduct water three feet from the foundation,
provided the yard slope does not exceed one and one-half percent grade. If the
slope of the yard exceeds one and one-half percent grade, and suitable storm
sewers are not available, roof drainage shall be tiled from the downspouts to a
curb opening at the street or shall be tiled to a natural watercourse. No
concentration of water shall flow onto the adjoining property. Where drainage
is to the front of lots, the top of the basement wall shall be not less than
twenty inches above sidewalk grade.
   (e)   Splash Blocks.  If splash blocks are used, the water shall be directed
from the downspouts by means of an elbow to the splash block.

shall discharge into sewer pipe not less than four inches in diameter, from a
point not less than six inches above finish grade to an elbow below finish
grade, and discharge into the storm sewer connection. The sewer pipe and elbow
shall be of cast iron, vitrified clay or other approved material, and all
joints shall be sealed. The elbow shall be securely blocked up with masonry or
braced to the wall with non-corrosive hangars, to prevent settlement.
   (g)   Discharge to Sanitary Sewer.  No water from downspouts, areaways,
cisterns or the ground surface shall be permitted to enter the sanitary sewer
system. The elevation of basement and garage floors shall be designed so storm
water cannot enter the sanitary sewer system. (Ord. 142-96.  Passed 9-23-96.)
1341.03  RETAINING WALLS.
   (a)   Plans and Permits.  Plans and permits are required for retaining walls
over three feet in height. Plans shall be submitted to the City Engineer and
the Chief Building Official for approval.

1379.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the City Council of Medina, State of Ohio, does ordain as
follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The City of Medina has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program,
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Medina as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional areas
of special flood hazard annexed by City of Medina.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Medina County, Ohio  and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Medina County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective August 4, 2008.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Medina as required by Section
1379.04 (c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at Medina City Hall, 132 North Elmwood Avenue, Medina, Ohio
44256.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.  Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Medina, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.   Should any section or provision of these regulations
be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision
shall not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part
thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
(Ord. 154-08.  Passed 7-14-08.)

overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (k)   Fill:  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (l)   Flood or Flooding:  A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (m)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM):  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development for a community, depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.

flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (p)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS):  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (q)   Flood Protection Elevation:  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus two (2) feet of freeboard.  In areas where no
base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (r)   Floodway: 
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (s)   Freeboard:  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (t)   Historic Structure:   Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio’s  inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)    Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by City of Medina's historic preservation program, which program is certified
by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (u)   Hydrologic and Hydraulic Engineering Analysis:  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (v)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC):  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (w)   Lowest Floor:   The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (x)   Manufactured Home:  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home”  does not include a “recreational vehicle”.  For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (y)   Manufactured Home Park:  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (z)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (aa)   New Construction:  Structures for which the  “start of construction”
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Medina Flood
Insurance Rate Map, September 30, 1988, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (bb)   Person:  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department or any court.
   (cc)   Recreational Vehicle:   A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Architect:  A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Engineer:  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Registered Professional Surveyor:  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (gg)   Special Flood Hazard Area:  Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may also
refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal state or
local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood information
reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone
soils associated with a watercourse.
   (hh)   Start of Construction:  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (ii)   Structure:   A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (JJ)   Substantial Damage:  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (kk)   Substantial Improvement:  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of
construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction”,
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure” provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (ll)   Variance:   A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (mm)   Violation:  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations. 
(Ord. 154-08.  Passed 7-14-08.)

   (h)   Map Maintenance Activities.  To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City of Medina’s  flood maps, studies and other data identified
in Section
1379.01 (f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1379.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (h)(1)A. hereof, prepared in a format
required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision,
and submitted to FEMA.  Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (h)(1)A.
hereof.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.   The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of City of
Medina, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Medina have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Medina's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Medina
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Medina suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or
the new area for which the City of Medina has assumed or relinquished
floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (i)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood  elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1379.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail
   (j)   Substantial Damage Determinations. 
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator in conjunction with the Medina City Building
Department, shall:
         A.    Determine whether damaged structures are located in special
flood hazard areas;
         B.    Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.    Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially
damaged structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior
to repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims. (Ord. 154-08.  Passed 7-14-08.)

the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis
that generates the 500-year flood elevation data.
   (k)   Access.  Proposed roads in Special Flood Hazard Areas within new
subdivision developments shall be designed and constructed so that the road
surface is elevated to or above the Base Flood Elevation.
   (l)   Compensatory Storage.  Development within the Special Flood Hazard
Area shall result in no net loss of natural floodplain storage. The volume of
the loss of floodwater storage due to development shall be offset by providing
an equal or greater volume of permanent flood storage by excavation or other
compensatory measures at or adjacent to the development site. This compensatory
floodplain storage shall be proposed and created in accordance with the
following requirements:
      (1)   Prior to issuance of a Stormwater Management Permit, a plan and
calculations prepared by a professional engineer shall be submitted for
approval. This plan shall be based on a field survey, shall show the existing
and proposed grades of the development and compensatory storage areas, and
shall be accompanied by calculations which demonstrate that the proposed stage
vs. storage volume relationship of the compensatory storage area would have the
same or greater storage volume at each stage as in the pre-development
condition of the proposed development area.
      (2)   The compensatory storage area shall have a hydraulic connection to
the affected watercourse which is equal to or greater than the pre-development
conditions and shall  provide the same or improved rate of flood storage
capture and discharge over the course of the flood event as in the pre-
development conditions.
      (3)   Compensatory storage shall be located adjacent to the development
area or on the opposite side of the stream across from the development area. In
the case of filling for a new stream crossing, the compensatory storage shall
be located upstream of the crossing.
      (4)   The compensatory storage area shall be a permanent component of the
property, and shall be repaired or replaced by the owner of the property if
silted-in or otherwise compromised by activities other than natural movement of
the stream.
      (5)   Where the applicant proposes compensatory storage on property owned
by others, the applicant shall submit a written agreement between such
landowner and the applicant wherein the landowner agrees to convey an easement
or other property interest or right to the applicant allowing compensatory
storage, and to permanently maintain such area for flood storage purposes, as
described in (4), above. Prior to construction, the applicant shall submit
documentation showing that conveyance of easements, property interests or
rights have been properly recorded with the Medina County Recorder's Office,
      (6)   The design and creation of the development and compensatory storage
areas shall incorporate best management practices as required by other Medina
County regulations or state or federal agencies to minimize soil erosion and
sediment impacts.
      (7)   Prior to grading or construction in development and compensatory
storage areas, the applicant shall be responsible for obtaining any necessary
permits or approvals from other involved agencies such as the Army Corps of
Engineers and the Ohio EPA.
      (8)   Prior to grading or construction in development and compensatory
storage areas, the applicant may be required to submit technical data regarding
the proposed flood boundary revision to FEMA and obtain a Conditional Letter of
Map Revision (CLOMR) in accordance with Section
1379.03(h)(1) of these regulations, based on the determination by the
Floodplain Administrator.
      (9)   After the development and compensatory storage areas are complete,
an as-built topographic survey of the development area and the compensatory
storage area shall be prepared and stamped by a professional surveyor and
submitted to the Floodplain Administrator. This survey shall be accompanied by
as-built stage vs. storage volume calculations prepared by a professional
engineer as described in (1.), above.
      (10)   After the development and compensatory storage areas are
satisfactorily complete, the applicant shall submit technical data to and
obtain a Letter of Map Revision from FEMA in accordance with Section
1379.03(h)(1) of these regulations. When the development and compensatory
storage areas are created for a new subdivision development, the Letter of Map
Revision shall be obtained prior to the Medina County Engineer's approval of
the final subdivision plat.
These regulations regarding compensatory storage shall not apply to public
highway, transportation, or drainage improvements or maintenance thereof
undertaken by a government agency or political subdivision.
   (m)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity.  Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.   In floodway areas, development shall
cause no increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge. Prior to issuance of a floodplain development permit, the applicant
must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered
professional engineer, demonstrating that the proposed development would not
result in any increase in the base flood elevation.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.  
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1379.03(h)(1);
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increase in base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of City of Medina and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
“bankfull stage”.  The field determination of "bankfull stage” shall be based
on methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Medina specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1379.03(h)(1)A.3., when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.
         E.   Alteration of watercourses which are tributary to a watercourse
which is the main stem or cause of a special flood hazard area are subject to
the requirements of subsection (m)(3) hereof  if such alteration is situated
within a floodway.

reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, and not contrary to the
public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a
literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance. 
         A.   Any owner or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City of
Medina.
      (2)   Public Hearing. 
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner,
            4.    The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area,
            9.    The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.    The costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets
and bridges.
            12.   The extent to which the hardship has been self-created by the
applicant.
            13.   In applications for variance from Compensatory Storage
standards contained in Section
1379.04(l) of these regulations, the following shall also be considered:
               a.   Minimization of fill or encroachment into the floodplain
               b.   Provision of compensatory storage to the maximum extent
possible.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause (refer to FEMA's
"Variance Guidelines").
            2.    A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property (refer to FEMA's "Variance Guidelines"). Increased cost or
inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these regulations does not
constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.    A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.    A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.    A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief,
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (3)   Other Conditions for Variances.  
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(2)A.1. to 11.
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.  
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting  its
decision, The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Medina County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 154-08.  Passed 7-14-
08.)
