LOS LUNAS - MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of
the Village of Los Lunas, New Mexico 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 20,
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

PREFACE 
    The Los Lunas, New Mexico Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1991, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 20, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of T.A. Mondragon, community development director. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 20, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 439, passed September 6, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the village as accessible as possible to village officials, village employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 20, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 20, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 20, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 20, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 20, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission.

We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version.

    Terminable-at-will. A terminable-at-will employee is one who fills an appointed or temporary position or is one who has not completed his probationary period. A terminable-at-will employee serves at the discretion of the village, and his employment can be terminated with or without cause. A terminable-at-will employee cannot grieve suspension, demotion, dismissal, or other disciplinary actions. 
    "Transfer" means the transfer of an employee from one department or office to another department or office in the village service. The village administrator may transfer employees from one position to another in accordance with village needs. 
    "Unclassified employees" means those filling appointed, casual, or limited term positions, and those who have not completed the probationary period. 
    "Village business" means the performance of duties of a village position at an employee's normal workstation or at a location authorized by the village. 
    "Volunteer firefighters" means firefighters who are on call and work regularly but intermittently do not qualify for the social security and Medicare exception for emergency workers defined in IRC Section 3121 (b)(7)(iii). This exception is only for temporary workers who respond to unforeseen emergencies, e.g., floods. When a worker who is termed a volunteer receives compensation, that compensation is in the form of wages subject to social security and Medicare tax if the worker is an employee (unless an exclusion applies). For instance, volunteer firefighters may not receive salaries, but they may receive amounts intended to reimburse them for expenses. They may also receive other cash or in-kind benefits that may be wages. Volunteer firefighters can receive tax-exempt reimbursements for their expenses, but these reimbursements must now be under an accountable plan within the meaning of IRC Section 62(c) and regulations. An accountable plan is one that is designed to reimburse only actual, substantiated business expenses. This provision is effective for tax years after 1988. An accountable plan must (1) require workers to substantiate actual business expenses, (2) allow no reimbursements for unsubstantiated expenses, and (3) require that any amounts received that exceed substantiated expenses must be returned within a reasonable period. Amounts that are termed reimbursements but that are not paid under an accountable plan are subject to income and social security and Medicare taxes. Therefore, a per diem or fixed amount paid to a firefighter (or other worker), that does not reimburse actual, documented expenses, is includible in income and subject to social security and Medicare. 
    "Volunteers" means individuals who serve on boards, commissions, and village departments, and are not village employees.

( Ord. No. 389, 3-13-2014 ) 
2.28.070 - Employee discipline. 
A. Basis for Employee Discipline. 
1.  Just Cause Discipline. Disciplinary actions for employees, are based on just cause in order to promote the efficiency of the services rendered by the village and the operation of its respective departments and offices. Disciplinary actions shall be consistent with governing laws and regulations and shall be taken without regard to race, age, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, physical, mental disability, serious medical condition, or any nonmerit factor. No employee shall be disciplined for refusing to perform an unlawful act. 
2.  Definition of Just Cause. Just cause is defined as any conduct, action or inaction arising from, or directly connected with the employee's work which is inconsistent with the employee's obligation to the village and reflects the employee's disregard of the village's interest. Just cause includes, but is not limited to, inefficiency, incompetence, theft, misconduct, negligence, insubordination, violation of village policy or procedure, unauthorized use of village funds, property, facilities, materials, disruptive behavior, repeated tardiness, excessive absences, unsatisfactory work performance which continues to be inadequate after reasonable efforts have been made to correct the performance problems, or for conviction of a felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude as described in the Criminal Offender Employment Act, NMSA 1978, Section 28-2-1, et seq. 
3.  Disciplinary Action. Any department head may take disciplinary action against an employee pursuant to the department head's authority and consistent with departmental policies and the merit system ordinance codified in this chapter. Copies of any documented disciplinary action shall be furnished to the village administrator's office for placement in the employee's file with the signature of the recipient acknowledging receipt of the action. 
4.  Approval of the Village Administrator and Consultation with the Village Attorney. Dismissal, involuntary demotion, and suspension for more than five days require approval of the village administrator and consultation with the village attorney before implementation. Whenever such consultation is not practical because of urgent circumstances, the employee should be put on administrative leave with pay and the situation reviewed with the village administrator as soon as practical. 
B.  Progressive Discipline. A classified employee shall be progressively disciplined for unsatisfactory work performance whenever practical. Each case of inadequate performance or act of misconduct shall be judged individually. The step of corrective action used depends on the severity of the infraction and the employee's previous work record. Under certain circumstances, as described below, suspension without pay or dismissal may be the appropriate initial disciplinary action. 
1.  Verbal Counseling. Verbal counseling is used for minor infractions such as informing the employee that his actions, behavior or conduct needs to change. Supervisors shall keep written notations of verbal reprimands. 
2.  Written Reprimand. 
a.  An employee may receive a written reprimand because the deficiency or infraction is of a greater degree than that for which a verbal reprimand may be used or if a verbal reprimand was not effective in correcting the employees conduct. 
b.  Written reprimands shall be placed in the employee's personnel file by the employee's supervisor after providing the employee with a copy of the statement. The employee shall be asked to acknowledge having read the comments by signing the statement. The employee's signature indicates the employee read the statement, but does not necessarily indicate concurrence with its content. If the employee refuses to sign, a witness must attest that the statement was presented to the employee. 
    The employee may respond with a written rebuttal, which shall be placed in the employee's personnel file. The placement of a written reprimand in an employee's file is not subject to the formal grievance procedure. 
3.  Suspension. An employee may be suspended by their department head without pay for a single serious offense, continued inadequate job performance, misconduct after previous attempt(s) to correct the conduct have failed or for misconduct. The department head must discuss the decision to suspend an employee with the employee's supervisor. Such suspension shall not exceed five working days. Suspension is not a necessary step in progressive discipline, and it may be eliminated if circumstances warrant. Suspension of an employee is not subject to the formal grievance procedure. 
4.  Demotion. An employee may be demoted to a vacant position for which the employee is deemed qualified when the employee would otherwise be terminated because the employee is unable to satisfactorily perform in the position presently held. Demoted employees shall receive a reduction in pay. A classified employee demoted due to an inability to render satisfactory performance in the position presently held is entitled to a grievance proceeding. Demotion is not a necessary step in progressive discipline. 
5.  Disciplinary Action. All documented employee disciplinary actions will include a plan of improvement that provides specific areas of improvement and a time limit to comply not to exceed sixty days. 
6.  Dismissal. Dismissal is the final consequence when progressive discipline has failed to change unacceptable behavior or performance or when the employee has engaged in behavior that is of a very serious nature and which is unacceptable for a village employee even though the employee has not been previously disciplined. After consultation with the village attorney, the employee's department head must recommend the decision to dismiss to the village administrator. 
7.  Authority to Take Disciplinary Action. Supervisors and department heads may take disciplinary action and shall maintain written documentation in support of the action, and may recommend suspensions over five days, demotions and discharges. However, only the village administrator may proceed with disciplinary action which includes suspensions over five days, demotions and dismissals. 
    The village reserves the right to exercise judgment and render disciplinary action or dismissal as determined appropriate based on the circumstances of each case. 
(Ord. 343 (part), 2007) 
2.28.080 - Grievance procedures. 
A. Types of Employee Grievances: Formal and Informal. 
1.  Formal Grievance Procedure. The formal grievance procedure applies exclusively to suspensions over five days, involuntary demotion, and dismissal of classified employees. 
a.  Written Notification. The department head shall present the classified employee with written notification of intent to suspend over five days, demote, or dismiss three working days in advance of the proposed action. The written notification shall explain the reasons for the proposed action, the evidence supporting the decision, and the employee's right to a pre-disciplinary hearing. The notification shall be hand-delivered to the employee and signed by the employee when at all possible.

f.  Terminated employees are ineligible to receive donations. 
g.  No right of donation is hereby created in any employee, regardless of circumstance. 
F.  Family and Medical Leave of Absence (FMLA). 
1.  Eligibility. To be eligible for family and medical leave benefits, an employee must have worked for the village for a total of at least twelve months and have worked at least one thousand two hundred fifty hours over the previous twelve months. Eligible employees may receive up to a total of twelve workweeks of unpaid leave during a twelve-month period (measured backwards from the date the leave is first to commence) for one or more of the following reasons: 
a.  The birth of the employee's child; 
b.  The placement of a child for adoption or foster care; 
c.  To care for an immediate family member (spouse, child or parent) with a serious health condition; or 
d.  To take medical leave when the employee is unable to work because of a serious health condition. 
    All time taken off from work for any of the above reasons shall be counted against the remaining balance of FMLA leave. 
    Leave for the birth, adoption, or placement in foster care of a child must be completed within twelve months of the applicable event. 
2.  Required Use of Accrued Leave. The village shall require an employee to use the employee's entire accrued and unused sick, annual and compensatory time to cover leave prior to going on unpaid leave. 
3.  Requesting Family and Medical Leave and Medical Certification. Employees requesting family care and medical leave shall be required to provide: (a) thirty-day advance notice when the need for the leave is foreseeable; (b) medical certification (both prior to the leave and prior to reinstatement); (c) periodic re-certification; and (d) periodic reports during the leave. The medical certification must state the date the condition started, how long it is expected to last, and, if the leave is to care for an immediate family member, how long the employee shall be needed to provide care and that the serious health condition requires the employee to provide such care. If the leave is for the employee's own serious health condition, the certification must also state that the employee is unable to perform the essential functions of the employee's current position. When leave is needed to care for an immediate family member or the employee's own serious health condition and is for planned medical treatment, the employee must try to schedule treatment so as not to unduly disrupt department operations. 
    If the employer has any doubt as to the validity of the certification, a second opinion may be required from a medical provider of the village's choice and at its expense. In addition, the village may require that a third opinion be obtained from a health care provider at the village's expense. In such an event, the opinion of the third provider shall be final and binding. 
4.  Reinstatement. An employee returning from an approved family and medical care leave of absence that does not exceed the maximum eligible length of leave shall be reinstated to his or her original position or an equivalent one with no loss of seniority or benefits that accrued prior to taking the leave. A medical release to return to work from a leave taken because of the employee's own serious health condition may be required from the employee. 
    "Serious health condition" means an illness, injury, impairment or physical or mental condition that involves either inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, residential health care facility, continuing treatment or supervision by a health care provider. An employee who does not return to work at the end of an authorized leave and does not obtain an approved extension of leave shall be regarded as having voluntarily resigned. 
    If an employee on leave is a salaried employee who is among the top ten percent of employees in terms of gross earnings and keeping the job open for the employee during the leave would result in substantial grievous economic injury to the operations of the village, reinstatement may be denied. In such cases, the village must give the employee a reasonable opportunity to return to work after notifying the employee of the intent to refuse reinstatement. 
5.  Continuation of Benefits. During an approved leave, the village shall continue to provide, if otherwise available, medical coverage under its group health plan on the same conditions that would have applied if the employee had not taken the leave. In no case shall the village continue to pay for such coverage for more than twelve weeks in any twelve-month period. The employee shall remain responsible for paying the employee's portion, if any, of the insurance premium, including the premium for dependent coverage, if available. Failure to pay premiums on a timely basis may result in a lapse of coverage. If the employee fails to return to work when the leave expires, the employee shall be required to reimburse the village for the group health insurance premium paid by the village on behalf of the employee during the leave unless the employee fails to return because of a continuation, reoccurrence, or onset of a serious health condition that entitles the employee to leave under this policy or due to circumstances beyond the employee's control. 
    No sick or annual leave shall accrue while an employee is on unpaid leave. 
6.  Intermittent Leave. Intermittent leave or reduced work schedule shall only be permitted if the employee suffers from a serious condition or if an employee's spouse, child, or parent suffers from a serious condition requiring continuing medical treatment. Intermittent leave must be scheduled with the employee's supervisor in advance of the need to take intermittent leave and must not unduly affect the village's business. The village may temporarily transfer an employee requesting intermittent leave to an alternative position under certain circumstances. 
G.  Bereavement Leave. In the event of a death in the employee's immediate family, as outlined under Section 2.28.050(E), including grandparents, the employee will be permitted two days leave with pay per calendar year not chargeable under any benefits.

Under extenuating circumstances, annual leave time may be used for bereavement purposes. 
H.  Administrative Leave with Pay. Leave with pay and travel pay may be authorized by the department head to allow employees to attend training, workshops, and meetings of boards and commissions when the employee's attendance is on behalf of the village and in the best interest of the village. Employees shall also receive payment for per diem, mileage, and all necessary and pre-approved out-of-pocket expenses. If the employee is paid by the board or commission for his attendance in excess of per diem, the village shall pay the employee his regular salary less the amount received by the employee from the board or commission or the employee may turn over the compensation from the board or commission to the village. Administrative leave with pay may also be granted with the approval of the village administrator pending disciplinary action.

2.  Reporting Procedure. Any employee claiming to be entitled to compensation shall give notice in writing to their supervisor regarding the alleged accident within fifteen days after the employee knew, or should have known, of its occurrence, unless, by reason of his injury or some other cause beyond his control, the employee is prevented from giving notice within that time, in which case he shall give notice as soon as may reasonably be done and at all events not later than sixty days after the occurrence of the alleged accident. 
3.  Medical Procedure. An employee who incurs a job-related injury or illness shall follow the procedures established as designated by the village administrator. The employee, a co-worker or supervisor must dial 911 to report the injury. The medical unit of the Los Lunas fire department will be dispatched to respond to the scene of the accident at which time the employee will be evaluated to determine if further medical attention is required. The medical unit will issue the authorization form required by the village for the treatment of the employee. 
4.  Return to Work. An employee must return to his former position or be reassigned to a comparable position if the village's physician certifies that the employee can return to work within three months of the injury. If an employee is unable to perform the essential functions of his job with reasonable accommodations at the end of three months, the employee may be dismissed within the guidelines of the law. 
5.  Modified Work Schedule. 
a.  An employee returning from workers' compensation disability may return to light duty if an appropriate position is available and the employee's physician certifies that the employee can return to a modified work schedule. 
b.  Light duty is defined either as performing the same job as the employee held before the injury, or as performing the duties of another position for which the employee is qualified, for fewer than eight hours each day or having reduced physical requirements for the full day or less than the full day. 
c.  The times and conditions of light duty shall be determined by the employee's department head in conjunction with the village administrator. All light duty assignments are temporary and shall not exceed three months.

A classified full-time or part-time employee, who has received benefits pursuant to the Worker's Compensation Act and who was unable to return to work during the twelve-week period during which the village held the employee's position open, may apply for his pre-injury job, a modified job similar to the pre-injury job, or any job that pays less than the pre-injury job, provided that the employee is qualified for this job and the village is hiring. The village shall rehire the classified full-time or part-time employee provided that the employee's treating health care provider certifies that the employee is fit to carry out the job without significant risk of injury. 
J.  Civic Duty Leave. An employee shall be given necessary time off with pay for the following: 
1.  Jury Duty. Pay for jury duty shall be authorized only for those days that the employee is scheduled to work. If excused by the court during a working day, the employee shall return to duty if at least one hour of village duty can be served in that work day. If the employee does not return to work, the balance of the day shall be charged to annual leave or leave without pay. 
a.  The employee shall provide his supervisor with a copy of the summons for jury duty.

The employee's supervisor may specify the hours for the leave. This leave shall not be granted to any employee whose work day begins more than two hours subsequent to the time of the opening of the polls, or ends more than three hours before the closing of the polls. Time off for voting shall not be used for other purposes. Department heads may inquire in the office of the county or village clerk to see if an employee is a registered voter before granting time off to vote. 
K.  Military Leave for Reserve or National Guard Duties. 
1.  Paid Military Leave for Reserve or National Guard Activities. Paid military leave shall be granted for authorized reserve or national guard activities for a maximum of fifteen working days during a one-year period.

The employee must furnish proof of duty orders or other documentation prior to leave being granted unless the leave is for emergency purposes. 
2.  Unpaid Military Leave. Employees voluntarily or involuntarily serving on active duty for more than fifteen working days shall be placed on leave without pay. The employee on unpaid military leave will not be allowed to use annual and sick leave. 
3.  Employees Returning from Unpaid Military Leave. Any employee who leaves a position he has held with the village other than a temporary position, to enter the armed forces of the United States, national guard or organized reserve, and who serves on active duty and is honorably discharged or released from active duty to complete his remaining service in a reserve component, and who is still qualified to perform the duties of the village position previously held, shall be reemployed in such position or to a position of like seniority status, and pay.

a.  The returning employee shall be deemed to have accrued seniority and length of service rights for the purpose of calculating sick and annual leave as though his employment with the village had been continuous since the date of initial employment. 
b.  The returning employee shall have all annual and sick leave accrued at the time of his departure for military services restored. 
L.  Inclement Weather. The village administrator may at his discretion close offices and send employees home with pay due to inclement weather.

No rule or regulation promulgated by the board shall require, directly or indirectly, as a condition of continuous employment, any employee covered by the labor-management relations ordinance to pay money to any labor organization that is certified as an exclusive representative. This issue of fair share shall be a permissive as opposed to a mandatory subject of bargaining between the parties. 
I.  Hearing Procedures. 
1.  The board may hold hearings for the purposes of:

b.  Adopting rules and regulations; and 
c.  Adjudicating disputes and enforcing the provisions of the labor-management relations ordinance, and rules and regulations adopted pursuant to the section.

6.  Each party to a prohibited labor practice shall bear the cost of producing its own witnesses and paying its representative for hearings under this section. 
7.  No regulation proposed to be adopted by the board that affects any person or governmental entity outside of the board and its staff shall be adopted, amended, or repealed without public hearing and comment on the proposed action before the board. The public hearing shall be held after notice of the subject matter of the regulation, the action proposed to be taken, the time and place of the hearing, the manner in which interested persons may present their views, and the method in which copies of the proposed regulation, proposed amendment, or repeal of an existing regulation may be obtained.

Notice shall be published once at least thirty days prior to the hearing date in a newspaper of general circulation in the village of Los Lunas, and notice shall be mailed at least thirty days prior to the hearing date to all persons who have made a written request for advance notice of hearings. 
J.  Appropriate Bargaining Units. 
1.  The board shall, upon receipt of a petition for a representation election filed by a labor organization, designate the appropriate bargaining unit. Appropriate bargaining units shall be established on the basis of occupational groups or a clear and identifiable community of interest in employment terms, employment conditions, and related personnel matters among the employees involved. Occupational groups shall generally be identified as blue collar secretarial clerical, technical, para-professional positions, professional, corrections, firefighters, and police officers. Department, craft, or trade designations other than as specified above shall not determine bargaining units. The parties, by mutual agreement and approval of the board, may further consolidate occupational groups. Essential factors in determining appropriate bargaining units shall include the principles of efficient administration of government, the history of collective bargaining, and the assurance to employees of their rights guaranteed by the section. 
2.  If the labor organization and the employer cannot agree on the appropriate bargaining unit within thirty days, the board shall hold a hearing concerning the composition of the bargaining unit. Any agreement as to the appropriate bargaining unit between the employer and the labor organization is subject to the approval of the board. 
3.  The board shall not include in any appropriate bargaining unit, probationary, supervisory, managerial, or confidential employees. 
K.  Elections. 
1.  Whenever, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the board, a petition is filed by a labor organization containing the signatures of at least thirty percent of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit, the board shall post a notice to affected employees regarding the filed petition and proceed with the process for conducting a secret ballot representation election. 
2.  Once a labor organization has filed a petition with the board requesting a representation election, other labor organizations may seek to be placed on the ballot. Any labor organization may file a competing petition containing the signatures of not less than thirty percent of the employees in the appropriate bargaining unit no later than ten calendar days after the board has posted a written notice that a petition for a representation election has been filed by a labor organization. 
3.  All representation elections shall include the option for "no representation," except in a run-off election where the choice of "no representation" was not one of the two choices that received the highest votes. 
4.  In the event of an election with two or more labor organizations on the ballot and none of the choices on the ballot received a majority of the votes cast, then a run-off election shall be held within fifteen calendar days. The choices on the run-off election shall consist of the two choices, which received the greatest number of votes in the original election. 
5.  A valid election requires that at least forty percent of the eligible employees in an appropriate bargaining unit cast votes in a representation election. In an election with only one labor organization, and the majority of the votes cast are in favor of representation, the board shall certify that labor organization as the exclusive representative for all the employees in the bargaining unit. 
6.  No election shall be conducted if an election has been conducted in the twelve-month period immediately preceding the proposed representation election. No election shall be held during the term of an existing collective bargaining agreement, except as provided in Section 2.32.130(B) of this code, after the expiration of the third year of a collective bargaining agreement with a term of more than three years. 
7.  Election disputes shall be resolved by the board. 
8.  As an alternative to the provisions of subsection (K)(1) of this section, the employer and a labor organization with a reasonable basis for claiming to represent a majority of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit may establish an alternative appropriate procedure for determining majority status. The procedure may include a labor organization's submission of authorization cards from a majority of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit. The local board shall not certify an appropriate bargaining unit if the employer objects to the certification without an election. 
L.  Exclusive Representation. A labor organization that has been certified by the board as the exclusive representative for employees in an appropriate bargaining unit shall represent all employees in the bargaining unit. The exclusive representative shall act for all employees in the bargaining unit and negotiate a collective bargaining agreement covering all employees in the bargaining unit. The exclusive representative shall represent the interests of all employees in the bargaining unit without discrimination or regard to membership or nonmembership in the labor organization. The existence of an exclusive bargaining representative shall not prevent employees from taking their grievances through the grievance process or filing prohibited practices with the board. Any settlement of a grievance or relief given on a prohibited practice brought by an individual shall not be inconsistent with or in violation of the collective bargaining agreement in effect between the employer and the exclusive representative or inconsistent with or in violation of a memorandum of understanding between the employer and the exclusive representative applicable to the day-to-day administration of the collective bargaining agreement. The exclusive representative shall be afforded the opportunity to be present at such hearings and make its views known. 
M.  Decertification of Exclusive Representative. 
1.  Any member of a labor organization or the labor organization itself may initiate decertification of a labor organization as the exclusive representative if thirty percent of the employees in the appropriate bargaining unit make a written request to the board for a decertification election. A decertification election shall be valid only if at least forty percent of the eligible employees in the bargaining unit vote in the election. 
2.  When there is a collective bargaining agreement in effect, a request for a decertification election shall be made to the board no earlier than ninety days and no later than sixty days before the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement, provided, however, that a request for a decertification election may be filed at any time after the expiration of the third year of a collective bargaining agreement with a term of more than three years. 
3.  When, within the time period prescribed in subsection (M)(2) of this section, a competing labor organization files a petition containing signatures of at least thirty percent of the employees in the appropriate bargaining unit, a representation election rather than a decertification election shall be conducted. 
4.  When an exclusive representative has been certified but no collective bargaining agreement is in effect, the board shall not accept a request for a decertification election earlier than twelve months subsequent to a labor organization's certification as the exclusive representative. 
N.  Scope of Bargaining. 
1.  Except for retirement programs provided under the Public Employment Retirement Act, the parties shall bargain in good faith on all wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment and other issues agreed to by the parties. The parties shall enter into a written agreement covering employment relations regarding the issues agreed to in collective bargaining. 
2.  Bargaining in good faith shall not require either party to agree to a proposal or to make a concession. 
3.  The obligation to bargain collectively imposed by the labor-management relations ordinance shall not be construed as authorizing employers and exclusive representatives to enter into any agreement that is in conflict with state statutes or federal statutes. In the event of conflict between the provision of any federal or state statutes and any agreement entered into by the employer and the exclusive representative, the former shall prevail. 
4.  Payroll deduction of the exclusive representative's membership dues shall be a mandatory subject of bargaining if either party chooses to negotiate the issue. The amount of dues shall be certified in writing by an official of the labor organization and shall not include special assessments, penalties, or fines of any type levied by the exclusive representative. During the time that a board certification is in effect for a particular exclusive representative, the employer shall not deduct dues for any other labor organization from members of the same bargaining unit. 
5.  Any agreement or impasse resolution by the employer and an exclusive representative that requires the expenditure of funds shall be contingent upon the specific appropriation of funds by the governing body and the availability of funds to fund the agreed upon provision. An arbitrator's decision shall not require the re-appropriation of funds. 
6.  The parties have a requirement that a grievance procedure culminating with final and binding arbitration be negotiated. This applies only to grievances and the interpretation and application of the agreement between the parties and does not apply to negotiation impasses. The parties shall share the cost of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this subsection equally. Each party is responsible for paying any cost related to its witnesses and representation. 
O.  Negotiations and Impasse Resolution. 
1.  The following meetings shall be closed: 
a.  Meetings for the discussion of collective bargaining strategy between the governing body and the employee's negotiating team preliminary to negotiations sessions; 
b.  Collective bargaining sessions; and 
C.  Consultations and impasse resolution procedures at which the employer and/or the exclusive representative of the appropriate bargaining unit are present. 
2.  The following negotiation procedures shall apply to the employer and exclusive representatives: 
a.  The negotiations for the first contract shall be opened upon written notice by either party to the other requesting that negotiating sessions be scheduled. Subsequent requests for negotiations shall be post marked no earlier than one hundred twenty days nor later than sixty days prior to the contract ending date or as negotiated by the parties. The parties may open negotiations at any time by mutual agreement. 
b.  All negotiations will be conducted in closed sessions. Negotiations will be held at a facility and at a time mutually agreed upon by the parties. 
c.  Recesses and study sessions may be called by either team. Prior to the conclusion of any negotiating sessions, the reconvening time will be agreed upon. Caucuses may be taken as needed. 
d.  Tentative agreements reached during negotiations will be reduced to writing, dated, and initialed by each team spokesperson. Such tentative agreements are conditional and may be withdrawn should later discussion change either party's understanding of the language as it related to another part of the agreement. 
e.  Agreement on contract negotiations is accomplished when the union president and the village administrator sign the agreement. Provisions in multi-year agreements providing for economic increases for subsequent years shall be contingent upon the governing body appropriating the funds necessary to fund the increase for the subsequent year(s). Should the governing body not appropriate sufficient funds to fund the agreed upon increase, either party may reopen negotiations. 
3.  The following impasse procedure shall be followed by the employer and exclusive representative: 
a.  If an impasse occurs, either party shall request mediation assistance. If the parties cannot agree on a mediator, either party may request the assistance of the federal mediation and conciliation service; and 
b.  If the impasse continues after thirty calendar days, either party may request an unrestricted list of seven arbitrators from the federal mediation and conciliation service. The parties shall choose one arbitrator by alternately striking names from such list. Which party strikes the first name shall be determined by coin toss. The arbitrator shall render a final, binding, written decision resolving unresolved issues no later than thirty calendar days after the arbitrator has been notified of his or her selection by the parties. The arbitrator's decision shall be limited to a selection of one of the two parties' complete, last, best offer. However, an impasse resolution decision of an arbitrator or an agreement provision by the employer and an exclusive representative that requires the expenditure of funds shall be contingent upon the specific appropriation of funds by the governing body and the availability of funds. An arbitrator's decision shall not require the employer to re-appropriate funds. The parties shall share all of the arbitrator's costs incurred pursuant to this subsection equally. Each party shall be responsible for paying any costs related to its witnesses and representation. The decision shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to the standards set forth in the Uniform Arbitration Act; 
c.  In the event that an impasse continues after the expiration of a contract, the existing contract will continue in full force and effect until it is replaced by a subsequent written agreement. However, this shall not require the employer to increase any employees' levels, steps, or grades of compensation contained in the existing contract. 
P.  Employers' Prohibited Practices. 
1.  A public employer or his representative shall not: 
a.  Discriminate against an employee with regard to terms and conditions of employment because of the employee's membership in a labor organization; 
b.  Interfere with, restrain, or coerce any employee in the exercise of any right guaranteed under the labor-management relations ordinance; 
c.  Dominate or interfere in the formation, existence, or administration of any labor organization;

f.  Refuse to bargain collectively in good faith with the exclusive representative; 
g.  Refuse or fail to comply with any provisions of the labor-management relations ordinance, board regulations, or the Public Employee Bargaining Act; or

2.  During the negotiation and the impasse procedure, village councilors and management employees are prohibited from negotiating issues which are the subject of negotiations and from making any offers, commitment, or promise whatsoever to employees or the exclusive representative, other than through the appointed village negotiating team. It is the intent of this language that the integrity of the negotiating process be maintained. All negotiations and concessions shall occur only between the respective appointed negotiating teams. 
Q.  Employees' Labor Organizations Prohibited Practices.

a.  Discriminate against an employee with regard to labor organization membership because of race, color, religion, creed, age, disability, sex, or national origin;

B.  Grant of Hearing. 
1.  A wrecker company shall be granted a hearing by the village administrator after written notice by registered mail or by personal service before suspension or removal from the rotation list may be undertaken.

Said record shall consist of a transcript or magnetic recording of all testimony taken during the hearing, all exhibits offered, all plans and specifications as may have been required and a copy of the village administrator's decision. The filing of an appeal in the district court does not itself stay enforcement of the decision of the village administrator, but the village administrator may grant, or the district court may order such stay upon appropriate terms. 
E.  Reasonable notice of the time, place, and nature of the hearing shall be afforded to all parties. In conducting a hearing, the village administrator shall afford all parties an opportunity for a full and fair hearing, including right to counsel and the right to call and examine witnesses, introduce exhibits and cross-examine witnesses who testify.

b.  Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions), 
c.  Unusual chemical oxygen demand or biochemical oxygen, or chlorine requirements in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the wastewater treatment works; 
d.  Slugs or shocks constituting an unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes which will disturb the normal functioning of the wastewater facility. 
10.  Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment works employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the effluent cannot meet the requirements of agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters. 
D.  Clerk-treasurer's Discretion. If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged, to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in this section of the chapter, and which in the judgment of the clerk-treasurer may have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater facilities, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the clerk-treasurer may: 
1.  Reject the wastes; 
2.  Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers; or 
3.  Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge. 
    If the clerk-treasurer permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the clerk-treasurer and state and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws. 
E.  Testing Industrial Wastes. Testing an industrial waste will be performed at least twice a year or whenever found necessary by the clerk-treasurer. The person discharging the waste shall be liable for payment of all costs arising from the testing of the industrial waste. 
F.  Grease, Oil and Sand Traps. Grease, oil and sand traps shall be provided when, in the opinion of the clerk-treasurer they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients, except that such traps shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All traps shall be of a type and capacity approved by the clerk-treasurer and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Grease and oil traps shall be installed in all new filling stations, garages, restaurants and other new facilities wherein heavy discharge of grease and oil is to be expected.

H.  Waste Meter-Manholes. 
1.  When required by the clerk-treasurer, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial liquid wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. 
2.  Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, constructed in such a manner as to prevent infiltration of ground and surface waters and constructed in accordance with plans approved by the clerk-treasurer. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
I.  Methods of Testing-Location of Test Site. All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "standard methods" and shall be determined at the control manhole provided or upon suitable samples taken at such manhole. The control manhole shall be located so that sampling of the industrial waste will be performed before discharge into the public sewer systems. 
J.  Sampling and Analysis Methods. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the wastewater treatment works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, COD, BOD and settleable solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples. 
K.  Access of Sampling. The clerk-treasurer shall be allowed access to the properties of all sewer users as necessary to sample, test and measure all wastewater discharges. Failure to allow such access may, at the village's discretion, be the basis for discontinuance of sewer and/or water service to the property to which access is denied. 
(Ord. 129 § 11, 1983) 
13.08.120 - User fees. 
A. Establishment of Equitable User Fees. The governing body of the village shall take the necessary steps to establish an equitable system of user fees. The purpose of this system is that each individual user shall pay an equitable portion of the village's cost of owning the wastewater facilities plus an equitable portion of the total operation and maintenance costs. 
B.  Fee Computation for Single-family Homes. For single-family homes, the user fees shall be computed as follows: 
UC = A + (K)(V) 
Where UC = monthly user charge fee in dollars per month. 
A = fixed charge in dollars per month for being connected to the sewer system whether or not any wastewater is discharged to the system and for which up to 2,000 gallons per month of water may be discharged to the sewer system. 
K = basic charge in dollars per month made per thousand gallons of water used per month above the 2,000 gallons per month allowed by paying the fixed charge. 
V = volume of water used per month in thousands of gallons above the 2,000 gallons per month allowed by paying the fixed charge; based on the average water consumption for the months of October through February, inclusive, and becoming effective for each user for a twelve-month period beginning with the village's billing for the month of February; if actual water use measurements are not available, this value shall be established by the village on the basis of expected water use for the building being served. 
C.  Fee Computation for Other Users. For all other users, except as otherwise provided in the sewer rate ordinance, the user fees shall be computed as follows: 
UC = A + (K)(V) 
Where UC and K are as previously defined. 
V = volume of water used per month in thousands of gallons above the 2,000 gallons per month allowed by paying the fixed charge; if actual water use measurements are not available, this value shall be established by the village on the basis of expected water use for the building(s) being served. 
D.  Industrial Surcharge. A surcharge will be assessed against persons discharging industrial liquid wastes which are of a greater strength than normal, untreated domestic wastewater. Normal untreated domestic wastewater is defined as having a maximum yearly average chemical oxygen demand not in excess of six hundred milligrams per liter and a settleable solids level not in excess of 10.0 milliliters per liter. The monthly industrial surcharge shall be computed from the following formulation: 
SR= (Vi) Kss(SS-10) +K COD (COD-600) _____ ___________ 10   600  
Where SR = surcharge in dollars per month; such surcharge being in addition to the monthly user charge. 
Vi = volume of water used per month in thousands of gallons. 
Kss = charge in dollars per month made per thousand gallons of water used for wastes of normal settleable solids concentration. 
K COD = charge in dollars per month made per thousand gallons of water used for wastes of normal COD concentration. 
SS = settleable solids concentration of the industrial waste in milliliters per liter; shall not be less than 10 for computation of the surcharge. 
COD =  COD concentration of the industrial waste in milligrams per liter; shall not be less than 600 for computation of the surcharge. 
Kss and K COD shall be computed by the village to reflect the village's estimation of the respective costs of treating the settleable solids and COD components of normal wastewater. To compute Kss and K COD , the following formula shall be utilized: 
K = Kss + K COD + Kv 
Where K, Kss and K COD are as previously defined. 
Kv = the estimated portion of K which may be attributed to the processing of a thousand gallons of wastewater independent of treatment or renovation of that wastewater. 
E.  Access of Village to Water Utility Records of User. For the purpose of assessing equitable user fees, any person discharging wastes to the sanitary sewers shall permit access by the village to water utility records for that person's property. 
(Ord. 265, 1999; Ord. 226 (part), 1995; Ord. 192 (part), 1993; Ord. 129-1990-1, 1990; Ord. 129-1988-1, 1988; Ord. 129 § 12, 1983)

A. Penalties-Continuing Violations. Every person deemed in violation of this chapter shall be cited to municipal court by the code enforcement officer. Every person convicted of a violation of this chapter shall be punished by a fine of not more than three hundred dollars or by imprisonment for not more than ninety days, or both. Each day this chapter is violated shall constitute a separate offense. The conviction and punishment of any person for a violation shall not excuse or exempt such person from the payment of any fee due or unpaid at the time of such conviction and nothing in this chapter shall prevent a criminal prosecution of any violation of the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  Remedies Cumulative-Liens. All remedies prescribed or liens created under this chapter or under the provisions of the law for collection and enforcement of the fees shall be cumulative and the use of one or more remedies by the village shall not bar the use of any other remedy for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter created by law. The fees authorized by this chapter shall be a lien in favor of the village upon the real property serviced and the personal property of the person used in connection with the sewer use which gave rise to the fee and such lien shall be imposed, collected, enforced and paid as provided by the law. No property of any persons shall be exempt from levy and sale on execution issued for the collection of a judgment for any fee imposed by this chapter. 
C.  Disconnection of Service. For repeated violations of this chapter, the village may disconnect the violator's building sewer and refuse to provide sewer service to the violator until assurances satisfactory to the village are provided by the violators that such violations shall cease.

This chapter shall be uniformly applicable to all development that occurs within the existing corporate jurisdiction of the village effective July 1, 1995, and as may be amended in the future. 
(Ord. 220 (part), 1995) 
13.16.040 - Intent and purpose. 
This chapter is intended to assess and collect impact fees in an amount based upon appropriate service units for water, sewer and parks in order to finance such facilities, the demand for which is generated by new development in the village. The purpose of this chapter is to ensure the provision of an adequate level of services for water, sewer and parks facilities throughout the village so that new development may occur in a manner consistent with the village's general land use plan. The governing body intends, by enactment of this chapter to require new development to bear the capital costs related to the additional capital facilities made necessary by such new development. The village is responsible for and will meet all capital improvement needs associated with existing development in the village. Only capital improvement needs created by new development will be met by impact fees. Impact fees shall not exceed the cost to pay for a proportionate share of the cost of system improvements based upon service units needed to serve new development. The impact fees shall be spent on new or enlarged capital facilities and equipment which substantially benefit those developments which pay the fees. The impact fees may also be spent on (1) the estimated costs and professional fees paid for preparing and updating the capital improvements plan, (2) for costs and fees charged by qualified professionals for services directly related to the construction of capital improvements or facility expansions, and (3) for administrative costs associated with this chapter, such administrative costs not to exceed three percent of the total impact fees collected as provided by Section 5-8-4 NMSA 1978.

In the event that any development impact fee schedule is subsequently changed to reflect increases in construction costs or other relevant factors, a credit holder may request a recalculation of credits to fairly reflect such changed circumstances. In the event that any development impact fee schedule is subsequently changed to reflect decreases in construction costs or other relevant factors, the village may recalculate such credits to fairly reflect such changed circumstances. 
E.  Any claim for a credit that is based upon any construction of improvements or contribution or dedication of land or money which was required or accepted by the village prior to the effective date shall be treated as a pre-ordinance credit regardless of the actual date of acceptance of the construction, or dedication by the village. 
F.  All credits shall be computed in accordance with the requirements set forth in this subsection: 
1.  The present value of cash contributions shall be based on the face value of the cash payment at the time of contribution. 
2.  For the present value of any contribution or dedication of land accepted for system improvements by the village from the developer, the value of contributed land shall be determined by the impact fees administrator based on a review of property appraisals applicable to the date of the dedication prepared by qualified professionals. 
3.  The present value of construction of system improvements shall be the present value of the lower of the value of the completed improvements based on an appraisal prepared by qualified professionals acceptable to the village, or the actual construction cost of the improvements. The cost or appraisal basis shall be adjusted to the date of actual cost or dedication. 
4.  The person claiming any credit shall be responsible for providing appraisals of land and improvements, construction cost figures, and documentation of all contributions and dedications necessary to the computation of the credits claimed. The village shall have no obligation to grant credit under this section to any person who cannot provide such documentation in such form as the impact fees administrator may reasonably require. The impact fees administrator may accept appraisals from the developer that were conducted contemporaneously with the original dedication or construction if he determines that said appraisals are reasonably applicable to the computation of the credit due. The impact fees administrator shall accept subsequent appraisals only if conducted by a certified appraiser or otherwise approved by the impact fees administrator. 
5.  The village shall give credit only for construction of improvements or contribution or dedication of land or money actually accepted by the village. Deposit of a check shall be deemed acceptance of cash by the village. Only land dedications formally accepted by the governing body or accepted by operation of law shall constitute acceptance for purposes of computing credits under this section. System improvements shall be deemed to be accepted only if and when the village engineer has determined that such improvements meet applicable village standards and agreed on behalf of the village to accept such improvements for maintenance. 
G.  Pre-Ordinance Credits. Credit shall be given for the present value of the construction of improvements or contribution or dedication of land or money by a developer required or accepted by the village from the developer or his predecessor in title or interest for system improvements prior to the effective date in accordance with the following requirements: 
1.  Said credits shall be applied only to development impact fees otherwise due for future development within the same service area and within the same category of system improvements. 
2.  The impact fees administrator shall deduct from the present value of the pre-ordinance credit the present value of the development impact fee that would have been charged for buildings or improvement within the project had the ordinance codified in this chapter been in effect on the date that the building permit(s) for construction of said buildings or improvements was filed, provided that said deductions will apply only to buildings or improvements for which a building permit was issued within two years prior to the effective date. 
H.  Post-Ordinance Credits. Credit shall be given for the present value of the construction of improvements or contribution or dedication of land or money by a developer required or accepted by the village from the developer or his predecessor in title or interest for system improvements subsequent to the effective date in accordance with the following requirements: 
1.  A person proposing credit for system improvements shall present cost estimates and property appraisals prepared by qualified professionals to be used by the impact fees administrator in determining the amount of the credit. All construction must be made in accordance with applicable village development and design standards. A person proposing post-ordinance credits for land dedication shall present the impact fees administrator with property appraisals prepared by qualified professionals to be used by the impact fees administrator in determining the amount of the credit. The impact fees administrator retains the right to determine the amount to be credited by causing to be prepared engineering and construction cost estimates and/or property appraisals for those improvements and/or right-of-way dedications. 
2.  In the event that post-ordinance credits are claimed prior to the completion of construction of the system improvements for which the post-ordinance credits is claimed, security is to insure completion of the system improvements in the form of a performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or escrow agreement shall be posted with the village made payable to the village in the amount approved by the impact fees administrator equal to one hundred ten percent of the full cost of the construction of system improvements. If a system improvement will not be constructed within one year of the acceptance of the offer by the village, the amount of the security shall be increased by ten percent compounded, for each year of the life of the security. The security shall be reviewed and approved by the village clerk-treasurer prior to the acceptance of the security by the village. 
I.  Agreements for Construction of Improvements in the CIP in Return for Credits/Reimbursements. A property owner may offer to construct a capital improvement listed in the impact fees CIP. The village may accept such offer on terms satisfactory to the village, such terms memorialized in a written agreement with the property owner prior to issuance of any building permit. The agreement must establish the estimated cost of the improvement, the schedule for initiation and completion of the improvement, a requirement that the improvement be completed to accepted standards, and such other terms and conditions as deemed necessary by the village. The village must review the improvement plan, verify costs and time schedules, determine if the improvement is an eligible improvement, and determine the amount of the credit for such improvement to be applied to the otherwise applicable impact fees prior to issuance of any building permit. In no event may the village provide a refund for a credit that is greater than the applicable impact fees. If, however, the amount of the credit is calculated to be greater than the amount of the impact fees due, the property owner may utilize such excess credit toward the impact fees imposed on other building permits for development on the same site and in the same ownership. Alternatively, the village may agree to reimburse the developer who constructs eligible capital facilities in excess of his proportional share from impact fees paid by new development which will use such capital facilities at such time as the impact fees are collected from the new development. 
J.  No credits shall be given for the construction of local onsite facilities required by zoning, subdivision, or other village regulation intended to serve only that development. 
K.  The applicant shall have the burden of claiming such credit at the time the impact fee assessment is made. The impact fee administrator shall make the final determination regarding the applicable credits.

13.20.040 - Water emergency stages. 
Any of the following water emergency stages may be declared by the governing body following a determination regarding the severity of conditions leading to a water shortage. Such determination shall be based on the best available information and data regarding the water supply and distribution system. 
    There are three water emergency stages which are triggered by an impending shortage of water estimated to occur during a specified period of time. If the severity of the water emergency lessens, the governing body may downgrade the water shortage to a lower stage or discontinue the water emergency. The water use restrictions and regulations of each stage are added to all higher level stages, unless the higher stage has a more stringent requirement. 
A.  Stage 1: Water Shortage Advisory-Voluntary Compliance. Whenever the estimated demands on the water system exceed the estimated supply such that it appears that there will be a substantial shortage of water over the next twelve-month period, a stage 1 water shortage advisory will be declared. The following requirements shall be in effect, and unless otherwise noted, are voluntary but strongly encouraged: 
1.  The village administrator shall make public announcements through the local news media and any other means available that an impending water problem exists, explaining the water conservation requirements of the stage 1 water shortage advisory; 
2.  All residents are encouraged to minimize indoor water use by utilizing high efficiency fixtures and appliances, decreasing water use for eating and cleaning purposes, and eliminating all on-site water leaks;

11.  All domestic well operators are urged to reduce water use to the minimum levels of absolute necessity. 
B.  Stage 2: Water Shortage Alert-Mandatory Compliance. Whenever the estimated demands on the water system exceed the estimated supply such that it appears that there will be a substantial shortage of water over the next six-month period, a stage 2 water shortage alert will be declared. The following mandatory requirements, in addition to the requirements of the stage 1 water shortage advisory, shall be in effect: 
1.  The village administrator shall make public announcements through the local news media and any other means available that an immediate water problem exists, explaining the water conservation requirements of the stage 2 water shortage alert; 
2.  With the exception of hand watering, drip or subsurface irrigation, use of reclaimed or greywater, all spray irrigation shall be prohibited between ten a.m. and six p.m. daily.

Chapter 13.24 - WATER RIGHTS REQUIRED 

13.24.010 - Transfer of water rights. 
A. An applicant for subdivision approval or the commercial development of property shall agree that if the village approves the subdivision or the commercial development, in consideration of that approval the applicant will make water rights available to the village in amounts as specified in this chapter. 
B.  At the time of application for preliminary plat or commercial development, the village will determine the amount of water rights that will be required by the proposed development. The applicant shall transfer these water rights to the village before the approval of the final plat or the approval of the commercial development, including any substantial changes to an existing building located on property that is currently being used for commercial purposes or being proposed for use for a commercial purpose and which substantial change requires the issuance of a permit required in Chapter 17.28 of the Village of Los Lunas Code, by transferring ownership and location of the water rights to the village in accordance with the rules and procedures of the State Engineer of New Mexico. 
( Ord. No. 426 , 11-2-2017) 
13.24.020 - Amount of water rights to be transferred or compensated. 
Except as provided in Section 13.24.030 herein, the amount of water rights required for any subdivision whose primary land use is residential shall be not less than 0.336 acre-feet per year of consumptive use for each dwelling unit in the subdivision. The amount of water rights required to be transferred to the village upon the approval of a subdivision for commercial purposes or for any commercial development of property requiring the issuance of a permit in accordance with Chapter 17.28 of the Village of Los Lunas Code are specified in Section 13.24.040. 
( Ord. No. 426 , 11-2-2017) 
13.24.030 - Water conservation requirements. 
Applicants for the approval of a residential subdivision will be permitted to transfer fewer rights than specified in Section 13.24.020 if they are able to demonstrate that the subdivision in question will serve fewer people; require less water; or have a higher return flow than a normal subdivision. A request for reduced water rights requirements shall be made in writing, and sufficient information provided, for the village engineer or other expert to determine an appropriate water budget for the proposed subdivision. The fee for the development of the water budget shall be seven hundred fifty dollars, payable by the requestor at the time of the request. Any reduction in water rights requirements shall be determined by the village based on all available evidence. Under no circumstances shall a subdivider be allowed to transfer water rights in an amount which is less than 0.2 acre-feet per year of consumptive use per dwelling unit. 
( Ord. No. 426 , 11-2-2017) 
13.24.040 - Commercial development. 
A. Where a subdivision, parcel of land within a subdivision, construction of buildings or the making of any improvements to an existing building requiring the issuance of any permit required by Chapter 17.28 of the Village Code involves land to be used for or being used for commercial purposes, the Village staff will review the development documents and determine if consumptive water use may exceed three AFY. If, in the opinion of the staff, consumptive water use could exceed three AFY, the village shall require the applicant to pay a non-refundable fee of seven hundred fifty dollars to compensate the village for the cost to prepare a report that estimates the total diversion and consumptive water use for the commercial development. The applicant shall cooperate in this process by providing all requested information with respect to water use at the property. 
1.  If total consumptive use for these purposes is estimated to be no more than three AFY, no grant of water rights or compensation shall be due from the applicant to the village. 
2.  If total consumptive use for these purposes will be in excess of three AFY, the village shall require that all consumptive use in excess of that amount be offset by compensating or granting consumptive use rights in the amount of that excess to the village as provided by Section 13.24.010 or through the purchase of a water rights credit. 
B.  If the commercial use within a subdivision, parcel of land within the subdivision, building or commercial development is amended, an amended water use report must be filed and consumptive use will be re-determined and water rights will be provided by the applicant accordingly. If, due to the amendment after the transfer of water rights to the village, the water use decreases by more than ten percent, the owner of the real property shall receive a water rights credit pursuant to Section 13.24.060 herein. If, due to the amendment after the transfer of water rights to the village, the water use decreases by less than ten percent, the owner of the real property shall not receive a water rights credit pursuant to Section 13.24.060 herein. 
( Ord. No. 426 , 11-2-2017) 
13.24.050 - Compensation in lieu of transfer.

In order to obtain a water rights appraisal, the applicant shall pay to the village the sum of five hundred dollars. The village or its designated representative shall then contact at least two water rights brokers and determine the price of the three most recent sales of fully transferable water rights in the Middle Rio Grande Valley, having priority earlier than March 19, 1907. Based on this information, the village shall calculate the current cost of water rights, and the applicant shall be required to pay to the village one hundred twenty-five percent of the calculated current cost of water rights. 
( Ord. No. 426 , 11-2-2017) 
13.24.060 - Transfers in excess of requirements. 
Where an applicant transfers more water rights than required, the applicant shall be given credit for water rights in an amount equal to the difference between the rights transferred and the rights required. The applicant may use this credit in one of three ways. 
A.  The credit may be used to help meet the requirements of this chapter with respect to a different subdivision or commercial development owned by the applicant. 
B.  The credit may be used to help meet the requirements of this chapter with respect to a different subdivision or commercial development owned by a different applicant, if and when the original applicant so assigns the credit for whatever consideration he deems adequate. 
C.  Upon application of the owner of water rights credits to the village administrator, the credits may be assigned to the village provided that each of the following criteria are established: 
1.  The village has sufficient funds to acquire the water rights credits; 
2.  The applicant is currently actively developing an existing subdivision or master planned community within the village; 
3.  The acquisition of the water rights credit by the village will promote economic development within the village; 
4.  The acquisition of the water rights credits by the village will not cause the applicant to be in violation of Section 13.24.020 or Section 13.24.040 of the Village Municipal Code as they currently exist or as they are amended from time to time; 
5.  The water credits were created by the applicant providing excess water rights to the village in compliance with Section 13.24.010 of the Village Municipal Code as it currently exists or is amended from time to time; and 
6.  The funds derived from the sale of the water rights credit will be used by the applicant to further the development of the applicant's subdivision or master planned community. 
D.  The village may compensate an applicant with any funds that are available, provided that the use of said funds does not violate state law. 
E.  The amount of compensation for the credit shall be determined in accordance with this subsection. The village or its designated representative shall contact at least two water rights brokers and determine the average price of the three most recent sales of fully transferable water rights in the Middle Rio Grande Valley, having priority earlier than March 19, 1907. The village shall then pay the applicant the average price for the excess water rights credits less the following discount: 
1.  For the purchase of three hundred acre feet or more of water credits, seven percent; 
2.  For the purchase of two hundred acre feet or more of water credits, but less than three hundred acre feet of water credits, ten percent;

Chapter 15.16 - LOW-INCOME AND SUBSIDIZED HOUSING 
Sections: 

15.16.010 - Location policy. 
The village shall encourage the development of publicly and federally funded housing for low-income people as defined by H.U.D. or publicly subsidized housing for low or moderate income people, henceforth referred to as "low-income" or "subsidized housing projects," in scattered sites throughout the village and avoid locating them in areas of high numbers of low-income persons, or areas that have a high percentage of minority persons unless housing is needed for replacement units or used as a move to upgrade the neighborhood in those areas. 
(Ord. 110 § a, 1981) 
15.16.020 - Unit limit. 
The village shall not approve a proposed low-income and subsidized housing project of more than twenty-five units at one site, except for elderly residents in which case the total number of units cannot exceed seventy-five in any one location, unless the project has been reviewed and passed affirmatively by the environmental planning commission, whose decision may be applied to the council. 
(Ord. 110 § b, 1981) 
15.16.030 - Design review. 
The village shall review design of proposed new construction of low-income or subsidized housing, and shall encourage flexibility and compatibility in design, type and construction techniques.

Chapter 15.24 - FLOOD AREA DEVELOPMENT RESTRICTIONS 
Sections: 

15.24.010 - Statutory authorization. 
The Legislature of the state of New Mexico has in 3-18-7 NMSA 1978 Annotated, as amended delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the municipal council of the village ordains as set out in this chapter. 
(Ord. 268-B (part), 2000: Ord. 150 Art. 1(A), 1988) 
15.24.020 - Findings of fact. 
A. The flood hazard areas of the village may be subject to inundation which could result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditure for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. 269-B (part), 2000; Ord. 150 Art. 1(B), 1988) 
15.24.030 - Purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
A.  Protect human life and health; 
B.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
F.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
G.  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. 150 Art. 1(C), 1988) 
15.24.040 - Definitions. 
Unless specifically defined in this section, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application: 
    "Alluvial fan flooding" means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
    "Apex" means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
    "Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO, AH or VO zone on the community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent chance or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    "Area of special flood hazard" means the land in the floodplain within the village of Los Lunas subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AE, AH, AD, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VB or V. 
    "Base flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    "Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    "Critical feature" means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    "Development" means any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    "Elevated building" means a nonbasement building (1) built, in the case of a building in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X and D to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in zones V1-30, VE or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water and (2) adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, D, "elevated building" also includes a building with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of zones V1-30, VE or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building," even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls meet the standards of Section 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    "Existing construction" means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    "Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    "Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    "Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
1.  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; 
2.  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    "Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)" means an official map of the community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    "Flood insurance study" is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the flood boundary-floodway map. 
    "Floodplain" or "floodprone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (See definition of flooding). 
    "Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
    "Floodplain management regulations" means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power.

    "Flood protection system" means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
    "Floodway (regulatory floodway)" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction of the proposed walls of a structure. 
    "Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
1.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
2.  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
3.  Individually listed on the state inventory of historic places which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
4.  Individually listed on the local inventory of historic places that have been certified either:

b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    "Levee" means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    "Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee or levees and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    "Manufactured home" means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". 
    "Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    "Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
    "New construction" means, for floodplain management purposes, structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by the community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    "New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by the village. 
    "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is: (1) built on a single chassis; (2) four hundred square feet or less when measured at the horizontal projections; (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    "Start of construction" (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-3481)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued; provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: (1) any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions; or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    "Variance" means a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefor, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. For full requirements, see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the village of Los Lunas floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4) or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

15.24.050 - Methods of reducing flood loss. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
A.  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
D.  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
E.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

(Ord. 150 Art. 3(F), 1988) 
15.24.120 - Liability disclaimer. 
The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the village or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

E.  Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions) the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary interpretation; 
F.  Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the State Coordinating Agency which is the State Engineer, prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; 
G.  Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained; 
H.  When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Article 3, Section B, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of Sections 15.24.170 through 15.24.190. 
I.  When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the floodplain administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones Al-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. 
J.  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, a community may approve certain development in zones A1-30, AE or AH on the community's FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM revision through FEMA

F.  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that relevant factors in Section 15.24.150(B) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
G.  Upon consideration of the factors noted in this section and the intent of this chapter, the planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter (Section 15.24.030). 
H.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
I.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
J.  Variances may be issued by the village for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that (1) the criteria outlined in subsections A through I of this section are met, and (2) the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(Ord. 269-B (part), 2000; Ord. 150 Art. 4(D), 1988) 
15.24.170 - Flood hazard reduction standards generally. 
In all areas of special flood hazards the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements: 
A.  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.

(Ord. 150 Art. 5(A), 1988) 
15.24.180 - Specific standards. 
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in Sections 15.24.070, 15.24.140(B) or 15.24.190(D), the following provisions are required: 
A.  Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of the subsection as proposed in Section 15.24.150(A)(1), is satisfied. 
B.  Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specification, and of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection.

2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; 
3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
D.  Manufactured Homes. 
1.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A, shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purpose of this requirement manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
2.  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: (1) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; (2) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; (3) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or (4) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement; 
3.  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of this subsection be elevated so that either: 
a.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation; or 
b.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
E.  Recreational Vehicle. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones Al-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM either: (1) be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days; (2) be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or (3) meet the permit requirements of Section 15.24.160(A), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in subsection D of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(Ord. 269-B (part), 2000; Ord. 150 Art. 5(B), 1988) 
15.24.190 - Subdivision proposal standards.

(Ord. 150 Art. 5(C), 1988) 
15.24.210 - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.24.070, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
A.  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
B.  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures: 
1.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or 
2.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
C.  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in Section 15.24.150(A)(1), are satisfied. 
D.  Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. 269-B (part), 2000) 
15.24.220 - Floodways. 
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.24.070, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
A.  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
B.  If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Sections 15.24.180 through 15.24.220. 
C.  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA. 
(Ord. 269-B (part), 2000) 
15.24.230 - Penalties for noncompliance. 
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a petty misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned for not more than ninety days, or both, for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the village from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

This title is enacted under the rights given municipalities by NMSA 3-17-1 et seq. (1978); 3-19-5 (1978); 3-19-6 (1978). These state statutes will be called the "state enabling acts" throughout these regulations. 
( Ord. No. 430, 12-21-2017 ) 
16.04.040 - Procedures. 
Any person who desires to subdivide land into two or more parts, or to amend or vacate a plat for any previously subdivided land, shall furnish a plat of the proposed subdivision, amendment or plat vacation, prepared by a surveyor, and shall comply with the requirements of these regulations. Upon request, the community development director shall furnish the subdivider with basic information on the requirements. 
    Any proposed subdivision, plat amendment, or plat vacation shall be reviewed according to the appropriate procedures chapter, as specified below. 
A.  Preapplication Procedure. All applications for subdivisions, plat amendments, or plat vacations shall request and attend a preapplication meeting, according to Chapter 16.16-Preapplication Procedure. 
B.  Summary Procedure. An application for subdivision or plat amendment shall be considered for review by summary procedure, an alternate, administrative review authorized by NMSA 1978, § 3-20-8, if it meets the following conditions: 
1.  It is prepared for land which has not been subdivided or amended through summary procedure in the previous two years; and 
2.  It is an initial subdivision which not increase the total number of parcels of land by more than two, provided that no streets or other public areas are created through the plat which are intended to be dedicated for public maintenance; or 
3.  It is an amendment to a previously recorded plat which does not increase the total number of parcels of land by more than two, or in which the total number of parcels remains the same or is decreased, provided that street and other public land dedications and utility easements remain the same as on the original plat; or 
4.  It is an initial subdivision or plat amendment which subdivides two or more parcels of land in areas zoned for industrial use, provided that no streets or other public areas are created through the plat which are intended to be dedicated for public maintenance. 
    A plat must conform to summary procedure in order to be reviewed as a family split. Refer to Chapter 16.20-Summary procedure for full description of requirements and timelines for applications submitted through summary procedure. 
    The community development director shall have the authority to determine whether plats submitted, which otherwise conform to the requirements of summary procedure, shall be brought before council for determination through minor subdivision procedure. The applicant will be notified at the time of preapplication meeting whether the community development director will require minor subdivision procedure to be followed. 
C.  Minor Subdivision Procedure. Any application for subdivision or plat amendment shall be reviewed by minor subdivision procedure if it meets the following conditions: 
1.  It otherwise conforms to the requirements of summary procedure, but has been determined by the community development director to require minor subdivision procedure to be followed; or 
2.  It is prepared for land which has not been subdivided or amended through summary procedure or minor subdivision procedure in the previous two years; and 
3.  It either does not increase the total number of parcels of land by more than ten (create more than ten lots on any single parcel of land), or results in the same number of total parcels, or results in a decrease in the total number of parcels; and 
4.  It does not include any lots that do not have street frontage; and 
5.  It does not require the installation of any significant infrastructure; and 
6.  If easements are to be terminated through the plat, it is clear that all benefited and burdened parties agree to the easement termination. 
    Area plans shall also be reviewed by minor subdivision procedure. In order to utilize minor subdivision procedure, the subdivider must agree to a thirty-day extension of the requirement by NMSA 1978, § 3-20-7 E, which states, "The planning authority of a municipality shall approve or disapprove a plat within thirty-five days of the day of final submission of the plat." Refer to Chapter 16.24-Minor subdivision procedure for full description of requirements and timelines for applications submitted through minor subdivision procedure. 
D.  Major Subdivision Procedure. All other subdivisions or plat amendments that do not qualify for summary procedure or minor subdivision procedure shall follow the procedure for major subdivisions, which require preliminary plat approval and final plat approval. Refer to Chapters 16.28-Major Subdivision Procedure-Preliminary Plat and 16.32-Major Subdivision Procedure-Final Plat for full description of requirements and timelines for applications submitted through major subdivision procedure. 
E.  Plat Vacation Procedure. All plat vacations not accomplished by a separate plat amendment shall follow plat vacation procedures, as outlined in Chapter 16.36-Plat Vacation Procedure. 
( Ord. No. 430, 12-21-2017 )

In order to provide guidance to subdividers concerning acceptable proposed plats, the following matters are fundamental: 
A.  Geographic Suitability. 
1.  An area shall be suited to the purposes for which it is to be subdivided, with reference to any officially adopted plans of the village. 
2.  The availability of adequate paved streets, fire protection, police protection, refuse service, public schools, parks and recreation facilities, and utility services shall all be weighed in considering the subdividing of land. They are not all necessarily required. 
3.  Land with the following types of problems shall have subdivision approval withheld until it is demonstrated that such hazards have been or will be eliminated: 
a.  Special drainage conditions; 
b.  Difficult topography; 
c.  Soil conditions which are unusually limiting; 
d.  Other geographic hazards to life, health or property. 
B.  Grading. 
1.  No subdivider shall proceed with any grading specifically in relation to a proposed subdivision before conditional approval has been given for the preliminary plat by the commission. Such grading shall be consistent with the recommendations of an approved drainage plan. 
2.  The subdivider shall preserve significant trees, historic places and other community landmarks wherever feasible or required. 
C.  Area Plan. 
1.  If the subdivider owns or controls land contiguous to the land that is to be subdivided, the village shall require the subdivider to submit a proposed area plan for the total area. The area plan shall follow the requirements of minor subdivision procedure, and must be approved prior to approval of the preliminary plat, or of the summary plat when two subdivisions have already been approved by summary procedure in the total area in the past two years. Any plat submitted shall be a reasonable planning unit in relation to the approved area plan. The proposed area plan shall show proposed use and densities as well as proposed arterial, collector and local street alignments. 
2.  All proposed street alignments shown in the area plan or any preliminary plat related thereto shall extend, complement or otherwise conform to existing municipal streets and to officially designated proposed street alignments. Likewise, shall all proposed sewer, water and drainage systems be made to extend, complement and conform to existing and proposed municipal facilities.

If an undeveloped nonconforming lot adjoins and has continuous frontage with one or more other undeveloped lots under the same ownership, then neither the owner of the nonconforming lot nor his successors in interest may take advantage of the provisions of this section.

17.40.020 - Use of designations P, T, D, C, A in table of permissible uses. 
When used in connection with a particular use in the table of permissible uses the letter "P" means that the use is permissible in the indicated zone. The letter "T" means a use is allowed as a temporary situation in the indicated zone. The letter "D" means a designated use permit must be obtained from the village council. The letter "C" means a conditional use permit must be obtained from the planning commission, and the letter "A" means the use is permitted as an accessory use. Where a use is permitted as an accessory use, a conditional use may be required as specified by Section 17.44 Supplementary Use Regulations.

(Ord. No. 370, 5-12-2011) 
17.40.030 - Permissible uses and specific exclusions. 
A. The presumption established by this chapter is that all legitimate uses of land are permissible within at least one zoning district in the village's planning jurisdiction. Therefore, because the list of permissible uses set forth in the table of permissible uses cannot be all inclusive; those uses that are listed shall be interpreted to consider unlisted uses. 
B.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions, the following uses are specifically prohibited in all districts: 
1.  Any use that involves the manufacture, handling, sale, distribution, or storage of any explosive materials; 
2.  Use of a travel trailer as a temporary or permanent residence. 
C.  Manufactured or factory built home sales/storage adjacent to the Main Street is prohibited.

Chapter 17.44 - SUPPLEMENTARY USE REGULATIONS 
Sections: 

17.44.010 - Preamble. 
This chapter contains additional regulations applicable to specific types of uses that supplement the requirements found in other chapters. This chapter will be amended over time as particular types of uses need regulations developed applicable just to those uses. 
(Ord. 276 (part), 2001) 
17.44.020 - Planned residential developments. 
A. Planned residential developments are permissible only on tracts of at least five acres located within A-R, RR, R1, R2 and R-3 zoning districts. 
B.  Permissible types of residential uses within this type of development include single-family detached dwellings, two-family residences, multi-family residences, and single-family attached dwellings. At least fifty percent of the total number of dwelling units must be single-family detached residences on lots of at least seven thousand five hundred square feet. 
C.  Single-family detached units shall be developed on the periphery of the tract so that single-family detached residences border adjacent properties. 
(Ord. 276 (part), 2001) 
17.44.030 - Planned unit developments. 
A. Planned unit developments are permissible only on tracts of at least ten acres located within the SU zoning district. 
B.  Within any lot developed as a planned unit development, not more than thirty-five percent of the total lot area may be developed for higher density residential purposes, not more than ten percent of the total lot area may be developed for commercial purposes. 
C.  The plans for the proposed planned unit development shall indicate the portions of the property that the developer intends to develop for each purpose. For purposes of determining the regulations that apply, each portion of the property so designated shall then be treated as if it were a separate district. 
D.  The nonresidential portion of any phase of the planned unit development may not be occupied until the entire residential infrastructure is completed. The purpose and intent of this provision is to ensure that the planned unit development procedure is not used, intentionally or unintentionally, to create nonresidential uses in areas generally zoned for residential uses. 
(Ord. 276 (part), 2001) 
17.44.040 - Temporary emergency, construction or repair residences. 
Permits for temporary residences to be occupied pending the construction, repair, or renovation of the permanent residential building on a site shall expire within six months after the date of issuance. The administrator may renew such permit for one additional period not to exceed three months if he determines that such renewal is reasonably necessary to allow the proposed occupants of the permanent residential building to complete the work necessary to make such building habitable.

1.  The hours of operation allowed shall be compatible with the uses adjacent to the activity; 
2.  The amount of noise generated shall not disrupt the activities of adjacent land uses; 
3.  The applicants shall guarantee that all litter generated by the special event be removed at no expense to the village; 
4.  The code enforcement officer shall not grant the use unless he finds that the parking generated by the event can be accommodated without undue disruption to or interference with the normal flow of traffic or with the right of adjacent and surrounding property owners. 
B.  In cases where it is deemed necessary, the code enforcement officer may require the applicant to post a bond to ensure compliance with these conditions.

B.  All livestock and poultry shall be kept in such a manner, which will not constitute a nuisance through violation of the following regulations: 
1.  No offensive noise, odor or dust shall be produced; 
2.  Areas devoted to livestock and poultry, including accessory buildings and structures, shall be constructed and maintained to discourage concentration and breeding of insects or pests; 
3.  All animals shall be confined within the owner's property boundaries.

17.44.220 - Landscape design standards. 
A. It is the purpose and intent of this section to foster the creation of regionally appropriate, sustainable landscapes. This section requires the utilization of water conservation and irrigation efficiency to guide the design, installation, and maintenance of landscaping. There is sufficient information to believe that certain trees and shrubs produce allergens that adversely impact the health and well-being of many residents of the village of Los Lunas, and that actions to reduce the production of these harmful allergens are therefore appropriate. It is also the purpose of this section to enhance the appearance of the village in order to promote civic pride and vitality. 
B.  The requirements of this section apply to subsections (B)(1) and (2) below, and a landscape plan that demonstrates compliance with this section is required with the following: 
1.  Applications for subdivision plat approval when landscaping is proposed for entrance features, medians or utility strips adjacent to sidewalks. 
2.  Applications for building permits as follows: 
a.  All new construction resulting in an enclosed structure with a gross floor area greater than five hundred square feet;

3.  Should the requirements of this section not have been met prior to the request for a certificate of occupancy the applicant may provide a financial guarantee, as per the existing policy of the community development department at the time of the request; 
4.  The director or his designee shall have discretion to allow alternate means of compliance with the requirements of this section when the proposed alternate means satisfy the intent, and are equivalent or exceed the requirements of this section. 
E.  Water conservation shall guide landscape and site planning, design, installation and management. Landscape design shall apply the principles of xeriscape and achieve the highest industry standards for irrigation efficiency. The purpose of these strategies is to develop drought tolerant landscapes and to reduce the demand on the potable water system. 
1.  Water features, including but not limited to fountains, streams and ponds are classified as high water use and must be integrated into an overall site water conservation plan; 
2.  All new irrigation systems and major renovations of existing irrigation systems shall install backflow prevention devices;

5.  Turf, sod, or grass seeding of cool season species shall not be planted in areas where any dimension is less than ten feet. 
F.  Plant material selection shall emphasize drought tolerant plant species and shall limit the use of high water use plan species. Tree species that increase harmful allergens are prohibited and include, but are not limited to, Cypress, Juniper, Mulberry, Elm and Ash. 
G.  Warm season grasses are recommended for decorative lawns. When installed, cool season turf grass lawns shall be limited to seed mixes containing not more than twenty-five percent Kentucky Bluegrass varieties and Poa prensis v. 
1.  Public parks and athletic fields are exempt from this restriction. These locations shall install only the minimum cool season turf required for the active recreational use; 
2.  As of November 7, 2002, Russian Olive and Salt Cedar shall not be sold or installed within the village limits because of their classification as noxious weeds. 
H.  Street trees:

7.  Street trees must be selected from the list of approved street trees, which is on file in the community development office; 
8.  The distance between evenly spaced trees shall be no greater than the diameter of the tree canopy at maturity. For example, a three hundred foot frontage will require ten trees with a thirty-foot canopy, or fifteen trees with a twenty-foot canopy. The area west of I-25 will require street trees to be planted for every sixty feet of frontage on Main Street. The number of trees placed in random clusters must equal or exceed the number of trees that would be required if they were placed evenly; 
9.  When parking areas are visible from Main Street or any street within a TOD-MU or TOD-R district, there shall be landscaping between the street and the parking with vegetation, planters, or berms. This landscaping shall be a minimum depth of ten feet, or six feet with a four-foot high screen wall. This landscaping shall be maintained between the parking area and the street regardless of site size; 
10.  Landscaping of off-street parking shall incorporate shade trees distributed throughout the parking area at no less than one tree for every twenty parking spaces west of I-25. Minimum size of tree planters shall be thirty-six square feet per tree. In no case shall the parking supply be reduced below the minimum number of spaces in this title; 
11.  Street trees located within twenty-five feet of parking may count toward the off-street parking shade tree requirements for that parking lot. 
I.  To preserve clear views at street intersections, driveways and medians, shrubs and ground covers within the clear-sight triangles shall be maintained at a minimum of seven feet from the lowest branch to the top of the curb. Only the plants that can withstand reflected heat from asphalt and pavement shall be planted. All landscape areas within the zone shall be irrigated with an automatic underground irrigation system and/or automatic drip irrigation system; 
J.  Commercial developments shall be separated from adjacent residentially zoned properties by inclusion of a seven-foot wide landscaped buffer area in the site plan and by vertical six-foot opaque screening with a fence, wall or landscape plants. Where small lots will be converted from residential to commercial, and the seven-foot wide landscape buffer will prevent the required amount of parking, buffer width can be reduced to not less than three feet with the provision that the proposed use of the lot will not be considered a nuisance to adjacent residential properties. Within the TOD-MU and TOD-R districts, a landscape buffer between residentially zoned properties and commercial developments shall not be required in front or side yards. 
(Ord. 356 (part), 2008; Ord. 280, 2002)

In calculating the affordability period for housing assistance grants of either land or buildings, the fair market value of the land or buildings or the costs of infrastructure at the time of the donation by the village shall apply. 
5.  Affordability Period. The village, in its discretion, may increase the affordability period in any contract, note, mortgage, loan agreement, land use restriction agreement, restrictive covenant agreements and/or any other agreement which the village may enter into with any qualifying grantee or beneficiary of the affordable housing funds or of the housing assistance grant. (See definition of affordability period in Section 18.04.030(B) of this chapter.) 
F.  Consent to Jurisdiction. Each qualifying grantee shall consent to the jurisdiction of the courts of the state over any proceeding to enforce compliance with the terms of the act, the rules and this chapter and any agreement between the qualifying grantee and the village and/or the MFA.

Title 19 - SPECIAL IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS 
Chapters:  
Chapter 19.04 - PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS 
Sections: 
 
19.04.010 - General policies. 
A.  General Use. PIDs should be utilized primarily in connection with the financing of infrastructure for development of residential projects, master planned communities or substantial commercial development and redevelopment. PIDs may also be utilized to provide an enhanced level of public infrastructure amenities and/or municipal services. In order to avoid inefficient use of the limited resources of the village, unless otherwise agreed by the council, PIDs will not be approved to finance less than three million dollars. The village's approval of a PID shall be based on an applicant's demonstration, to the reasonable satisfaction of the village, that the PID will provide benefit to the end-users of the PID-financed infrastructure or to the village which would not otherwise be available, which benefit may include, without limitation, additional amenities, services, increased quality of development or pricing benefits. A master planned development which has had a fiscal impact analysis which demonstrates that the cost of infrastructure delivery to the development will not have a net cost to the village will be deemed to have met the end-user benefit requirements of the village. Public improvements financed by a PID shall conform to applicable village policies for development. Except as expressly agreed by the village based upon its determination that village-owned utilities will not be adversely affected, "stand alone" utilities which compete directly or indirectly with village services shall not be financed through PIDs. Real property dedications and conveyances required by existing village policies for development, growth management and conservation shall remain in effect notwithstanding the establishment of a PID. The council may agree to participate in various projects depending on project type, location and cost when such factors have a clear benefit to the public. Public infrastructure proposed for the PID shall be concurred to by the council and must be of the type specified in NMSA 1978, § 5-11-2(M), as amended, namely: 
1.  Sanitary sewage systems, including collection, transport, storage, treatment, dispersal, effluent use and discharge; 
2.  Drainage and flood control systems, including collection, transport, diversion, storage, detention, retention, dispersal, use and discharge; 
3.  Water systems for domestic, commercial, office, hotel or motel, industrial, irrigation, municipal or fire protection purposes, including production, collection, storage, treatment, transport, delivery, connection and dispersal; 
4.  Highways, streets, roadways, bridges, crossing structures and parking facilities including all areas for vehicular use for travel, ingress, egress and parking; 
5.  Trails and areas for pedestrian, equestrian, bicycle or other nonmotor vehicle use for travel, ingress, egress and parking; 
6.  Pedestrian malls, parks, recreational facilities and open space areas for the use of members of the public for entertainment, assembly and recreation; 
7.  Landscaping, including earthworks, structure, lakes and other water features, plants, trees and related water delivery systems; 
8.  Public buildings, public safety facilities and fire protection and police facilities; 
9.  Electrical generation, transmission and distribution facilities; 
10.  Natural gas distribution facilities; 
11.  Lighting systems; 
12.  Cable or other telecommunications lines and related equipment; 
13.  Traffic control systems and devices, including signals, controls, markings and signage; 
14.  School sites and facilities with the consent of the governing board of the public school district for which the site or facility is to be acquired, constructed or renovated; 
15.  Library and other public educational or cultural facilities; 
16.  Equipment, vehicles, furnishings, and other personally related to the items listed in this subsection; and 
17.  Inspection, construction management and program management costs. 
B.  Cost and Expenses. Unless otherwise agreed by the village, all costs and expenses incurred by the village in connection with (i) its review of a PID application; and (ii) the formation of a PID shall be paid by the applicant through advance payments as provided in this chapter. Costs and expenses incurred by the village in connection with the application and formation of a PID shall not be a liability of the village. Costs and expenses shall include the costs of services rendered by village staff and services rendered by outside consultants who may be retained by the village including, but not limited to, bond counsel, financial advisers, engineers, appraisers, tax consultants and attorneys, at the rates normally charged by those consultants. 
C.  Reimbursement. If authorized by the PID, all or part of such advanced payments may be reimbursed to the applicant from a PID tax levy, PID assessments, PID revenues or PID bond proceeds, provided that such reimbursement shall be in conformity with federal law, state law and these guidelines. 
D.  Construction or Finance of Improvements. Except as otherwise agreed by the village, PIDs will construct or finance improvements on such terms with such persons as the PID board of directors determines to be appropriate, in accordance with NMSA 1978, § 5-11-10(D), as amended. 
E.  Cost of Administration and Operation. Unless otherwise agreed by the village, all costs of administration and operation of the PID and the operation and maintenance of public infrastructure in the PID which has not been dedicated to and accepted by the village, shall be the responsibility of the PID, the applicant, applicable homeowners' associations, or any combination of the foregoing, as may be acceptable to the village and the PID. 
F.  PID Boards of DirectorsDelegated Authority. PIDs will initially be governed by a five-member board of directors appointed by the council in accordance with NMSA 1978, § 5-11-9(A) which shall be composed of two full-time employees of the village, two persons selected by the applicant with the approval of the council, and a fifth member selected by the other four members. The council may, in accordance with the Public Improvement District Act ("act"), delegate certain responsibilities of governance of PIDs to public officials employed by the village. Day-to-day responsibilities of PIDs will be performed by outside personnel pursuant to a PID development agreement entered into pursuant to NMSA 1978, § 5-11-10(A)(2) or village staff. In order to avoid confusion with other development agreements entered into by the parties with respect to real property within the village, a development agreement entered into regarding the administration of a PID may be denominated as a "PID development agreement". Each PID development agreement shall be in implementation of this chapter and upon execution by the village and the applicant. In the event of a conflict between this chapter and the PID development agreement, the PID development agreement shall supersede this chapter. On a date not more than six years after the formation of a PID, in accordance with the act, new PID board members shall be elected or the governance of the PID shall revert to five members of the council. 
G.  Self-SupportingNo Impact on Village. Unless otherwise agreed to by the village, PIDs shall be self-supporting with regard to financing, operations and maintenance, and village funds will not be used for PID purposes. Notwithstanding anything contained in this chapter, neither the village's property, its full faith and credit nor its taxing power shall be pledged to the payment of any PID obligation or indebtedness. The amount and structure of debt of a PID shall not have any direct negative material impact on the village's debt ratings with Standard & Poor's Corporation, Moody's Investors Services, Inc., Fitch Investor Services, Inc., or any other nationally recognized bond rating agency service then rating the village's outstanding bonds. 
H.  PID Development AgreementFeasibility Reports. The amount, timing and form of financing to be used by a PID shall be determined by the PID board based upon a project feasibility report and established by agreement of the village, the PID and the applicant through a PID development agreement pursuant to NMSA 1978, § 5-11-10(A)(2). 
( Ord. No 448, 10-10-2019 )

Potential applicants for a PID are required to meet with village staff for pre-application meeting in order for the PID review staff to accomplish the following preliminary tasks: 
1.  Make an initial determination whether the proposed PID is consistent with the village's growth policies, land use and development policies, zoning and other applicable regulation; 
2.  Make an initial determination whether the PID applicant's ownership interest, delegation of ownership rights or other legal control of the real property proposed to be included in the PID to have standing to submit a PID application; 
3.  Establish a proposed schedule for (i) the applicant's submittal of a PID application, (ii) village PID staff review of the application for completeness, (iii) the planning and zoning commission (the "commission") meeting for review and recommendation to council, and (iv) council meeting for consideration of and action on the application; and 
4.  Identify any related village approvals that will be required to permit the PID, if approved by the council, to construct the proposed improvements. 
B.  Role of PID Review Staff. The determinations by PID review staff shall be of an advisory nature, for the purposes of assisting applicants in submitting completed applications with detail and information required to enable meaningful consideration by the council. Staff determinations and recommendations shall be considered by but not be binding on the council.

A.  Application Submission. One print copy and one digital pdf version of an application for the formation of a PID and an application fee of thirty thousand dollars (the "application fee") shall be submitted to the village administrator. 
B.  Application Fees. The application fee shall be utilized by the village for initial application review and project feasibility analysis, including the payment of the village's financial and legal advisors, at their customary rates, to assist in the evaluation of the feasibility of the proposed PID project. Ten thousand dollars of the application fee shall be nonrefundable. The balance of the application fee shall be used by the village in connection with its review of the application. If the applicant withdraws its application prior to the village's completion of its application review, the village shall remit the unused portion (if any), of the application fee (but not the nonrefundable ten thousand dollars portion) to the applicant. Upon the applicant's request, the village will provide an accounting of expenditures of funds advanced. Any unused portion of advances shall be refunded to the application at such time as the village determines that all costs and expenses have been paid. The village and its legal consultants shall use reasonable efforts to determine whether any features of a PID proposed in an application appear not to be feasible, and to advise the applicant early in the review process, for the purpose of avoiding unnecessary additional costs of review. 
C.  Post-Application Conference. After the application and the application fee has been submitted, the village administrator, or designee thereof, will arrange a conference with the appropriate PID review staff for the purpose of reviewing the application and determining whether the application is complete. If, following the application conference or any other time during the application process, PID review staff requests additional information, the applicant shall provide any and all supplemental information requested, in accordance with the provisions of Section 19.04.030(K). 
D.  PID Review Staff Report. After analysis of an application is supplemented, PID review staff, under the direction of the village administrator, or designee thereof, will prepare a report including recommendations relating to the PID, an analysis of the impact of the formation of the PID and its effects on the village. The report may provide a recommended disposition of the application and any additional requirements that are recommended in connection with the applicant and/or the PID. If all costs billed to or incurred by the village have been paid by the applicant by a date at least fourteen days prior to the date of the meeting of the council at which the appropriate resolution(s) approving the application is to be introduced, and if the application meets the qualifications provided herein, the application, along with any report and recommendations by PID review staff, will be forwarded to the council, along with drafts of the appropriate implementing resolution(s). 
E.  PID Development Agreement. If the council approves an application for formation of a PID, the applying applicant and the staff of the village shall coordinate a schedule of events for the formation of the PID and shall negotiate an appropriate PID development agreement between the village and the applicant which shall be entered into in connection with the formation of the PID which, if approved by the council, shall incorporate the recommendations of the PID review staff relating to such PID, and any other restrictions, provisions and agreements required by the village. 
F.  Preliminary Approval. An applicant may request preliminary, nonbinding approval of its PID application by the council ("preliminary approval"). 
1.  A request for preliminary approval will be considered following payment of the initial application fee and information such as the following: 
a.  A description of the proposed PID's boundaries; 
b.  A description of the improvements to be constructed by the applicant; 
c.  The estimated construction costs of the improvements and anticipated completion time; 
d.  A description, by category, of improvements and related costs to be financed by the PID; 
e.  The estimated issuance amount of PID; 
f.  The total annual special levy amount (i.e., estimated aggregate annual debt service on bonds); and 
g.  The maximum annual PID property tax or, in the case of a special levy, the allocation method and maximum special levy per dwelling unit (single-family residences) or per acre (multifamily and commercial), and method by which the levy will be allocated from bulk tract to finished lots. 
2.  The PID review staff report will advise the council whether preliminary approval is recommended, not recommended, or that no recommendation is made. 
3.  Preliminary approval shall not require review by the commission, and such approval shall be made by simple motion rather than by resolution. 
G.  Additional Fees. An applicant that has received preliminary approval may be required to make such additional advances as the village staff determines are necessary to pay the costs of reviewing the applicant's request for formal approval of the formation of the PID based on a PID development agreement within the meaning of the act. However, an applicant may be required to submit an additional initial application fee if, in village staff's determination, the application for formal approval of a PID departs substantially from the parameters set forth in the application for preliminary approval. 
H.  Notice of Public Hearing. Pursuant to NMSA 1978, § 5-11-4, no PID application shall be acted on without a duly noticed public hearing. The notice of public hearing shall be mailed by registered or certified United States mail, postage prepaid, to all owners of real property in the proposed district at least thirty days prior to the date of the hearing. In addition, notice shall be published once each week for two successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the village. The last publication shall be at least three days before the date of the hearing. The notice shall comply with requirements of NMSA 1978, § 5-11-4(B) and (C). 
I.  Planning and Zoning Commission Review. The commission shall issue a recommendation to council on any PID application. This recommendation shall certify that the PID application has met the criteria established in Section 19.04.030Application contents, and shall note any comments or concerns regarding the PID application for council's review. The commission shall review the PID application at a regularly scheduled bi-monthly commission meeting. The commission may review a draft of the PID application rather than the final version, if delaying the commission review would cause the application review to exceed the ninety-day review period described in NMSA 1978, § 5-11-3(A). 
J.  Approval of Formation and PID Financing. The council may consider the granting of formal approval to the formation of the PID development agreement that may be approved prior to or concurrently with the approval of the formation of the PID. The council may include in its approval of the PID formation the issuance of one or more series of PID bonds, subject to the terms and conditions of the PID development agreement. The council's approval of PID formation and issuance of bonds shall be conditioned on the requirement that the PID shall utilize bond counsel, underwriters and/or other consultants selected by or otherwise acceptable to the written approval by the council. 
K.  Extension of Application Review Period Beyond Ninety Days. In the event that the village is unable to take formal action on the PID application within the ninety-day review period described in NMSA 1978, § 5-11-3(A), the developer will withdraw and resubmit its application with no penalty or additional fee.

The administrative expense fee shall be applied by the PID to the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the formation, review of any feasibility study, election costs, administration, operation and maintenance of the PID or its public improvements. From time to time, upon depletion of the administrative expense fee, the PID may request, and the developer/landowner shall promptly deposit with the PID, additional amounts deemed by the village to be necessary for the purposes contemplated in this section. Nothing in this subsection preclude the reimbursement of such expenses from PID taxes, levies, charges or bond proceeds, as permitted by the act. 
B.  Administration, Operation and Maintenance Charge. In order to provide for the PID to be self-supporting of its administrative, operation and maintenance expenses, and to finance services in addition to those provided by the village, the village may condition its approval of a PID, on the PID's imposition of up to three dollars per one thousand dollars of assessed value ad valorem tax, not as tax or charge of the village, but in accordance with the provisions of NMSA 1978, § 5-11-23, as amended, upon the PID taxable property which is not village-owned infrastructure otherwise maintained by the village; provided, however, that to the extent permitted by law the PID shall be entitled to charge such rates, fees, and charges to property owners as are necessary to address any shortfall in the expense required to operate and maintain the PID's improvements, and that such rates, fees and charges shall be established in the development agreement for the PID. 
C.  General Obligation Bonds. General obligation bonds of the PID will be payable from an unlimited valorem tax on taxable property located within the PID, designated by the general plan for the PID, as subject to the PID property tax, as required by the act. 
1.  An applicant for general obligation bonds shall describe to the PID board of directors in a project feasibility report the following: 
a.  The current direct and overlapping tax and assessment burden on the taxable property that is proposed to be taxed and the fair market value and assessed valuation of the taxable property as shown on the most recent assessment roll; 
b.  The projected amount and timing of PID general obligation bonds to be used; 
c.  The projected market absorption of the development within the PID; 
d.  The effect of the PID bond issuance on PID tax rates, calculated as of the beginning, midway through and at the end of the marked absorption period or based on the phasing of the project to be financed, as applicable; 
e.  An estimate of the applicant's construction costs associated with the public improvements, in excess of the estimated PID-funded costs of the project; and 
f.  The necessity of the applicant and the PID entering into a contribution agreement, which may require a letter of credit or other third-party guarantee of the bonds by the applicant. 
2.  The value to lien ratio, after the issuance of the bonds and construction of the improvements to be financed by the PID, will be at least three to one based on an MAI appraisal. 
3.  The projected tax rate for debt service set forth in feasibility report shall be established in the PID development agreement, and may include provisions which (i) limit the maximum tax rate that will be imposed by the PID for payment of debt service on PID bonds, (ii) require a contribution agreement from the applicant for the payment of debt service in the event of a shortfall in revenue from the PID tax revenues projected in connection with, and all the time of, PID formation, or (iii) establish, to the village's satisfaction, other protection for homeowners or other end-users of the property located in the PID against excessive tax rates in the event that PID indebtedness exceeds PID tax revenues available to pay debt service in any particular year. 
D.  Special Levy Bonds. Special levy bond shall be secured by a first lien (co-equal to the lien for general taxes and prior special assessments) on the property benefited in the manner contemplated by NMSA 1978, § 5-11-20(G). 
1.  Applicants for special levy bonds shall describe in each project feasibility report, the following: 
a.  The current direct and overlapping tax and assessment burden and special levy on real property to comprise the PID and the full cash value and assessed valuation of that property as shown on the most recent assessment roll; 
b.  The projected amount and timing of the PID special levy bonds to be issued; 
c.  The projected market absorption of development on the PID; 
d.  The projected special levy burden to be placed on the assessed parcels and the anticipated mythology of assessment; 
e.  An estimate of the applicant's construction cost associated with the public improvements in excess of the estimated PID-funded costs of the project; and 
f.  The necessity of the applicant and the PID entering into a contribution agreement, which may require a letter of credit or other third-party guarantee of the bonds by the applicant. 
2.  The value to lien ratio, after the issuance of the bonds and construction of the improvements to be financed by the PID, will be at least three to one based on an MAI appraisal. 
3.  At the time the PID is formed, the maximum allowable rate of special levy for residential property shall not cause the total tax and assessment obligation for such property, including projected ad valorem taxes, special levies and special assessments, to exceed 1.99 percent of the anticipated market value of residential property as determined by a then current MAI appraisal. The 1.99 percent shall include all known and authorized, but unissued debt and any other anticipated fees or assessments which may be imposed by the Village or special district on a property within the PID, i.e., special assessment districts, including the proposed maximum special levy, except service charges for utilities and refuse. 
E.  Revenue Bonds. Revenue bonds shall be payable from a PID revenue source. 
1.  An applicant for revenue bonds shall describe in each project feasibility report, the following: 
a.  The current fee structure for comparable services or otherwise incurred by persons who would be responsible for paying the proposed rates, fees, and charges; 
b.  The revenue source from which bonds will be payable. The village reserves the right to require the applicant to produce such independently prepared feasibility studies or reports as it deems necessary to confirm the amount and availability of revenues; 
c.  The projected market absorption of development within the PID; 
d.  The projected amount and timing of PID revenue bonds to be issued; 
e.  The financial impact of the proposed rates, fees, and charges on prospective residents or other users of such rates, fees and charges; 
f.  An estimate of the applicant's construction cost associated with the public improvements in excess of the estimated PID-funded costs of the project; and 
g.  The necessity of the applicant and the PID shall enter into an as appropriate contribution agreement, which may require a letter of credit or other third-party guarantee of the bonds by the applicant. 
F.  Suitability. The village intends that the PID only have the power to sell the proposed bonds to suitable investors. If the proposed bond issue is not rated (either on its own merits or by the use of appropriate credit enhancement) in one of the three highest investment grade ratings issued by the Standards & Poor's Corporation, Moody's Investors Services, Inc., Fitch Investors Services, Inc. or any other nationally recognized bond-rating agency service, then the bonds must have minimal denominations of one hundred thousand dollars and be available for purchase and restricted with respect to resale to "Qualified Institutional Buyers" (as such term is defined in Rule 144A of the Securities and Exchange Commission) or to "accredited investors" (as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D of the Rules Governing the Limited Offering and Sale Securities without Registration under the Securities Act of 1933). It is the intention of the village to have investor suitability achieved through the rating requirements set forth in the preceding sentence or the establishment of large minimum denominations (e.g., not less than one hundred thousand dollars) and, if the village determines it is appropriate, covenants limiting secondary market sales of PID bonds through registered broker-dealers. Notwithstanding the restrictions pertaining to public sales and private placements of bonds set forth in this section, the restrictions may be modified or relaxed if other financing structures or features are presented which, in the sole discretion of the council, provide other means to address investor suitability concerns. The minimum denomination requirements set forth above for the PID bonds which are initially issued without rating shall not continue to apply if the PID subsequently obtains a rating in one of the three highest rating categories as provided in this section. 
G.  Contribution. At the time the PID is formed financial projections must demonstrate that the landowners shall provide over the life of the project at least twenty-five cents in infrastructure or community improvement (which may include, for example, dry utilities and other improvements for the benefit of the property owners within the PID, irrespective of whether such improvements are publicly or privately owned) for each one dollar of debt to be issued by a PID to finance public infrastructure purposes, except as otherwise determined by the village in its discretion. The village, in its discretion, may condition approval of PID formation on additional financing requirements, including, without limitation, the deposit of cash, or letter of credit (or similar credit facility) as security for completion of the infrastructure development. If agreed to by the village or PID board, as applicable, in the discretion of the village of PID board, infrastructure and community improvement constructed or acquired by the applicant prior to, contemporaneously with or subsequent to the formation of the PID may be included in calculating the applicants compliance with this subsection; provided, that no improvements which have not already been constructed or acquired shall be included in that calculation unless the completion of the improvements is guaranteed or secured by an appropriate completion bond, cash deposit or other security acceptable to the village or PID board, as applicable. 
H.  Debt Service Reserve Funds. If allowed by law (including any applicable federal laws relating to the tax-exempt status of the bonds), all bond issues may include a debt service reserve fund in an amount acceptable to the PID board. 
I.  Environment Site Assessments. Unless otherwise provided to the village pursuant to the other requirements prior to PID financing and acquisition by the PID or village, the PID and village will require an independent environmental report or assessment of any real property which will be dedicated to or otherwise owned, leased or operated by the village or the PID and a proposed form or indemnity agreement with respect to all environmental law liability. 
J.  Refinancing and Refunding Bonds. Refinancing and refunding of bonds issued on behalf of a PID will be considered utilizing the same criteria set forth in this section and shall be subject to the review and approval of the council or its designee. Refinancing and refunding will be expected to either: (1) generate interest rate or net present value savings; (2) restructure payment of principal; (3) reimburse the applicant for actual costs expended for public improvements contemplated to be part of the proposed project; or (4) eliminate burdensome covenants. 
K.  Cost of Change. Applicants shall be responsible for all additional costs and expenses incurred in any special levy or property tax modifications resulting from changes to the development not anticipated in the application. 
( Ord. No 448, 10-10-2019 )  
19.04.060 - Miscellaneous. 
A.  Discretion and Waiver. Based upon the recommendations of PID review staff and/or financing legal consultants retained by the village, the council may approve the PID applications which do not meet the foregoing criteria, if the council, in its discretion, determines that the particular features of the proposed PID, likelihood that the PID's projects and purposes will be successfully completed and mechanisms protecting against default on bonds, warrant that the foregoing criteria need not be applied. In making that determination, the council may consider an opinion of an underwriter with a reputation satisfactory to the council that the particular features of the PID, the proposed projects and the bonds proposed to be issued can be successfully marketed and that the plan of finance is feasible. 
B.  Timeframe to Commence PID Development Activities. The village will require any PID within its boundary make an annual report to council on the status of development. The report shall include the estimated construction periods for any and all infrastructure expected to be constructed within the boundaries of the PID. Annual reports shall be made at the first council meeting of each calendar year. If construction has not begun prior to the presentation of the fifth annual report, then council may review the parameters established by the PID formation resolution. 
C.  Purchaser DisclosureMarketing Materials. Each purchaser of real property located in the PID shall execute an acknowledgement of the PID disclosure form. The applicant shall also supply the village with a copy of the receipt. (Applicants are required to describe in their promotional material the financial and other relative impacts on the development being induced in a PID. Copies of the disclosure form must be placed on file with the village.) 
D.  Indemnity. The applicant (or such other third party acceptable to the village and the PID), shall indemnify the village and the PID and their agents and employees and shall hold the village and the PID and their agents, officers and employees harmless for, from and against any and all liabilities, claims, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in any challenge or proceeding to the formation, operation, administration of the PID, the offer and sale of PID bonds, the levying by the PID of any tax, assessment, special levy or charge and the operation and maintenance of public infrastructure financed or owned by the PID. 
E.  Amendment. All amendments to this chapter shall have a prospective effect only and shall not in any way effect or otherwise modify the approval of preexisting PID.
