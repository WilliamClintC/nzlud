professionals and employees within the Township. Inquiries, advisory
opinions, violations, complaints and penalties of Chapter 2.98 shall be
processed by the Local Finance Board in accordance with N.J.S.A.

for information on behalf of a constituent, if no fee, reward or other
thing of value is promised to, given to or accepted by the officer or a

immediate concern for the safety of property in the vicinity. Among the
circumstances which may be considered by the enforcement officer in

the fact that the person takes flight upon appearance of an enforcement
officer, refuses to identify him or herself or manifestly endeavors to
conceal him or herself or the graffiti tool. Prior to any citation being
issued to a person for a violation of this chapter, such person shall be

containers, unless such spray paint container is held for sale or
transfer in an enclosed device which is constructed to prevent
removal of the merchandise except by authorized attendants or is
stored, out of sight, in such a way as to prevent free access to the
merchandise by the public. The merchant may, at its discretion,
utilize a line-of-sight display. To qualify as a line-of-sight display, the
products must be easily and readily observed by the retail
personnel at all times. To accomplish line-of-sight requirements, a
retailer may utilize placement of personnel work stations, mirrors
or cameras or other such devices or arrangements acceptable to

or bank shall be left open at any one time in excess of 500 lineal feet.
B. If at any time during the course of the work, the engineer in his or her
judgment deems that adequate traffic control is not being maintained
by the applicant, the Township may take such steps as are necessary in
the judgment of the engineer to maintain adequate traffic control and
the cost thereof shall be charged to such sums on deposit in the same
manner as set forth for the making of corrections in the work and as

engineer, or his or her representative, in accordance with their salary
rate, as permitted by the Municipal Land Use Law of the state of New
Jersey, N.J.S. 50:55d-1 et seq.
D. All work performed must be done within the time specified by the
engineer or the inspector. If the applicant shall backfill the opening and
temporarily pave the surface thereon within the time set forth in the

shall become the property of Raritan Township and shall not thereafter
be refunded. The Engineer may extend the date for completion of
the temporary paving or for completion of the final paving, or both,
in cases in which in his or her judgment he or she considers such
extension justifiable, and any reduction in refund shall then date from
such extended date.
E. If dust, dirt or other detrimental material continue to arise as a result of
the work or neglect of the applicant, its agents, contractors or
representatives, or if a nuisance is, in the opinion of the engineer,
caused by the actions of any of the parties, the engineer may stop the
work until the situation complained of is eliminated. The Engineer may
direct that suitable amounts of calcium chloride or other dust settling
material be used as may be required.
Streets and paved surfaces must be kept broom clean. If dust persists
streets may be required to be hosed clean.
F. No blasting shall be allowed unless permitted by the Township
Engineer. Work shall be so conducted so as not to interfere with the
existing utilities, water mains, sewer lines, gas pipes or electrical
conduits, or the service connections thereof, and in case of injury to any
such utility, it shall be the duty of the applicant, at its own expense, to
properly repair or replace the same. The applicant shall not at any time
come closer than three feet to any trunk line water pipe without the
permission of the engineer. Such pipe shall be protected or temporarily
supported as directed by the Engineer.
Wherever the construction work passes under a service line of water,
sewer lines, gas pipes, electrical conduits or the service connections
thereof, the applicant shall cause, where the Engineer shall deem
necessary, the same to be temporarily supported by a brace extended
six inches or more into the solid earth on each side of the trench
and extending the full width of the roof. The brace so used shall be
of such material and placed as directed by the Engineer, and may be
removed when backfill has been satisfactorily placed each side of the
brace. No excavation shall be made which in the opinion of a competent
nurseryman will damage shade trees.
§ 12.24.050 RARITAN CODE § 12.24.050
1.01:256
G. In placing backfill, the applicant or his contractor shall use a
mechanical or vibrating tamping machine. Six inches to 12 inches of
backfill shall be tamped as directed by the Engineer. Whenever the
engineer considers the excavated material unsuitable for backfill, the
applicant shall backfill the trench with sand or bank run gravel, or such
other material as the Engineer may direct, acceptably compressed as
directed.
H. On unimproved roads and shoulders, the backfill shall be brought up to
within seven inches of the existing surface grade. There shall then be
placed six inches of two and one-half crushed stone ballast which shall
be bound up with Grade "B" screenings and thoroughly compacted. The
top one inch shall be three-quarters inch crushed stone quarry blended
with sufficient fines to make a tight, stable surface.
I. On banks and slopes of improved or unimproved Township roads or
grass sidewalk areas, the topsoil shall be saved and carefully replaced
after the trench has been tamped properly and settled completely. The
topsoil shall be replaced after final settlement, shall be raked evenly
and shall have rye grass seed sown thereon, or other means satisfactory
to prevent erosion of slopes and banks. The applicant or his or her
contractor may bring in sod in order to restore slopes, banks or
sidewalk area to a satisfactory condition.
J. Where a street was previously paved, the pavement shall be placed on
backfill as required by Subsection G above. The type of paving shall
conform to Chapter 12.08 if the same is within a private development or
shall conform to Chapter 12.04 if located along a Township road.
Should the existing pavement be of greater thickness or of superior
materials than that specified in Chapters 12.04 or 12.08, then the new
pavement shall be equal to the existing pavement.
K. The existing black-top pavement shall be cut in a straight line prior to
any excavation being made. Excavation shall only be allowed between
the cuts so made. If the edge of the excavation is ragged or zigzag when
it comes time to repave the street or shoulder, then the street pavement
shall be cut out in a straight line as directed by the Township Engineer,
parallel to the line of the excavated trench in a width sufficient to
straighten out any rough edges and the entire area shall then be
repaved.
L. Pending the actual repaving operation stated above, the contractor
shall use a temporary fill over the trench of such material as may be
directed by the engineer to the end that no loose stones, mud or dirt
may impede the flow of traffic. The Engineer may at any time require
any irregularity in the surface to be immediately taken care of.
M. The applicant assumes the responsibility of refilling the trench as it may
sink from time to time, and keeping it level with the balance of the
pavement. The applicant shall supply the name, address and telephone
number of the representative of the person doing the work so that
§ 12.24.050 CODE ADOPTION § 12.24.050
1.01:257
notice of settling or potholes in any trench of the applicant, verified
by the police department, may be made to the applicant's agent
immediately after verification.
N. After repavement the applicant shall be under the duty of maintaining
the trench for a period of 18 calendar months, and assume the
responsibility of refilling the trench as it may sink, as directed by the
Engineer, and in case of undue settlement, may be required to open the
trench to ascertain the cause of the undue settlement and to remedy the
same as required by the Engineer.
O. Upon the failure of the applicant to comply with any of these
requirements, the Township may do the necessary repairs and
replacements and charge the same to the applicant.
P. In cases where it becomes necessary to resort to tunneling operations
to reach the point of connection with the main line, the backfill in such
tunnel shall be of rammed soil composed of a mixture by volume of one
part cement to six parts of coarse aggregate material such as sand or
bankrun gravel.
Q. Surplus material such as broken up concrete or excavated material
shall be disposed of by the applicant by placing the same at any point
within the Township specified by the engineer within one mile of the
project, and it shall be the duty of the applicant to dump and grade, if
necessary, the material as directed by the Engineer. If the Township
does not require the material within one mile of the project, the
applicant must dispose of it in a satisfactory location.
R. The applicant shall deposit with the clerk the sum of $50 with each
application for each opening to be made in the road pavement, shoulder
or bank. A maximum continuous opening of not more than five feet in
length may be made under such deposit. If the proposed excavation is
for more than a single hole of up to five feet in length, the sum of $10
per lineal foot of the opening applied for shall be deposited; but in no
case less than $500, the payment to be made five days before the
beginning of any work or the moving of any equipment or material to
the site of the proposed opening.
S. For house connections the deposit shall be $50 for each opening,
regardless of the type of pavement or the length of the ditch.
T. The applicant may in lieu of a cash deposit submit a surety bond which,
upon approval of the Township Committee, shall have the same force
and effect as a cash bond. The bond shall by its terms provide for
payment of any damages by or from the acts of the applicant, its agents,
servants or subcontractors, and save the Township harmless from any
suits at law or otherwise which may result from damages sustained by
any persons or property as a result directly or indirectly of the work
performed under the permit. Public utility corporations of the State of
New Jersey may file a corporate bond on a yearly basis in an amount of
$5,000 in lieu of cash or construction bonds.

MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS
§ 12.28.010. Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets
and Highway; Adopted by Reference. [Prior code § 7-10; amended by
Ord. 88-29]
The Township Committee finds and declares that problems of traffic control
occur when traffic must be moved through or around road or street
construction maintenance operations, and utility work, above or below
ground which requires blocking the roadway and obstructing the normal
flow of traffic; and that such obstructions are or can become dangerous
when not properly controlled. In order to better promote the public health,
safety, peace and welfare, it is necessary to establish controls and
regulations directed to the safe and expeditious movement of traffic for the
work forces performing these operations.
The Township adopts the current Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices, 1978 edition with appropriate updates, hereafter known as
M.U.T.C.D., except as supplemented and amended by this chapter, as it
controls and regulates whenever construction, maintenance operations or
utility work obstructs the normal flow of traffic. Any person, contractor,
or utility, who fails to comply with the provisions of the M.U.T.C.D. while
performing such work is in violation of this chapter.

Chief of Police or his or her designated representative or Township
Engineer in order to arrange a pre-construction meeting in order to submit
plans for the safe movement of traffic during such period of construction
work. Any person, contractor or utility who fails to comply with this section
prior to the start of such work or whose plans are not approved by the
office of the Chief of Police or his or her designated representative or the
Township Engineer is in violation of this section.
U. All street or road surfaces so restored shall be subject to final release
and acceptance in writing by the Township Engineer. No deposit money
shall be returned nor bond released until 18 months after the
completion of the project and its acceptance by the Township Engineer,
and then only upon the above written certification by the Township
Engineer that the work has remained in a satisfactory condition for the
18 months.

at least two emergency contact telephone numbers to be called in case
of emergency problems at the construction or maintenance site prior to
the start of any work. If, for any reason, emergency contacts cannot be
reached, or if the emergency contact person does not respond to a call
from the police department to correct a hazardous condition, the Township
may respond to correct such hazardous condition. The reasonable fees for
such emergency services by the Township shall be charged to the person,
contractor or utility responsible for such condition.

Ord. 88-29]
Traffic directors shall be posted at all construction or maintenance sites
when determined by the Chief of Police or his or her designated
representative that same is necessary to provide for the safe and
expeditious movement of traffic.
§ 12.28.060. Violations; Penalties. [Prior code § 7-10.5; amended by
Ord. 88-29]
Any person, contractor or utility who commits a violation of this chapter
shall, upon conviction thereof for a first offense pay a fine of not less than
$100 nor more than $500 and/or be imprisoned in the county jail for a term
not exceeding 90 days. For a second offense, upon conviction thereof, pay

assignments along the streets and roads of the Township. All properties

numbers shall proceed from a logical point of origin and shall be in proper
numerical sequence in relation to the numbers assigned to other lots with
access to the same street. New streets will follow west to east numbering
and south to north numbering. Odd numbers will be on the left side and
even numbers will be on the right side starting from low to high. This shall
be the initial assignment of numbers. Every effort will be made to follow
these procedures. The number 13 will not be used. If circumstances dictate
the change of the numbering format from its natural sequence it will be
reviewed on an individual basis with agreement from the 9-1-1 Coordinator

§ 13.04.030. Connections. [Prior code § 11-1.3]
The following requirements shall apply:
authorized in writing by the Raritan Township Municipal Utilities
Authority or the Department of Health of the State of New Jersey.
A. The Authority's engineer shall issue a certificate of completion with
regard to the sanitary sewer system and shall forward the certificate of
completion to the Township Clerk with a list of all properties which are
connection units and which are in existence on the date of the issuance
of the certificate of completion, designated by tax map lot and block and
name and which connection units are located on property which either
contains or abuts a collection sewer. The Township Clerk within 10 days
of the receipt of the certificate of completion from the Authority's
engineer, shall cause written notice to be mailed by certified mail,
return receipt requested, to each owner of a connection unit designated
by tax map lot and block and name on the list supplied by the
Authority's engineer and the notice shall contain information about
applications for a permit to install a sewer connection, a list of fees,

connection units shall direct that the connection units shall be
connected with and use the services of facilities of the authority's
sanitary sewer system to the exclusion of any other systems or methods
for the collection and disposal of sanitary sewage and industrial wastes
within 90 days from the date of receipt of the notice. Subsequent to the

additional notices to the Township Clerk that additional lines have
become available as a part of the sanitary sewer system, if and when
the lines are constructed, and the notices from the Authority's engineer
shall also contain a list of all connection units designated by name of the
owner, tax map block and lot numbers which shall be connected to the
additional new lines. The Clerk shall again forward notices as
previously described herein to the owners of those connection units and
forward the notices requiring connection to the sanitary sewage system
within 90 days after receipt of the certified mail notice.
B. Connection units shall be connected with and use the services and
facilities of the Authority's sanitary sewer system to the exclusion of any
other system or methods for the collection and disposal of sanitary
sewage and industrial wastes before the new connection unit is used or
occupied unless said unit has received a waiver from said connection
requirement from the Raritan Township Planning Board under Section
16.18.100 Land Subdivision Standards or Section 16.20.040 Site Plan
Design Standards. [Amended by Ord. 02-9; Ord. 02-14]
C. If the connection unit is not subject to review by the Raritan Township
Planning Board under Section 16.18.100 Land Subdivision Standards or
Section 16.20.040 Site Plan Design Standards then the Authority may
§ 13.04.020 CODE ADOPTION § 13.04.030
1.01:279
specifically exempt said connection unit from the requirements of
Subsections A and B of this section, if the authority finds that the
connection with the sanitary sewer system by the connection unit would
be economically unfeasible to the owner of the connection unit. The
Authority may rescind the exemption if and when a connection becomes
economically feasible, or when the Township's authorized agent
determines that a public health or safety hazard exists and that the
continued exception would aggravate the situation. [Amended by Ord.
02-9; Ord. 02-14]
D. If any owner, after being given proper notice of the sewer's availability,
fails to comply with the provisions of this section and Section
13.04.020, the Authority shall request the Township to cause the
connection or installation to be made under the direction and
supervision of the Township's authority agent and the authority's
engineer.
1. The Township shall cause notice of the contemplated connection to
be given in writing to the owner of the properties affected, within
30 days after receipt of a written request from the Authority. The
notice shall contain a description of the property affected,
sufficiently definite in terms to identify it, as well as a description of
the required connection or installation, and notice that unless the
connection or installation is completed within 30 days the Township
shall proceed to make the connection, or cause the same to be
done. In the event that any owner, after being served with proper
notice by the Township as described herein, fails to complete the
connection or installation within the 30 days as prescribed herein,
then the owner shall be subject to any penalties provided by this
Code.
2. When any such connection or toilet installation is made, a true and
accurate account of the cost and expense shall be kept and
apportioned to the property or properties thereby connected, and a
true statement of the costs under oath shall be forthwith filed by
the Township's authorized agent in charge of the connection or
installation with the Clerk of the Township. The Township shall
examine the same, and, if properly made, shall confirm it and file
such statement with the Township Tax Collector. The Township Tax
Collector shall record the connection or installation charge in the
same book in which he or she records sidewalks and other
assessments; and shall remit to the Authority any connection fee
charged by the Authority for connections of similar units paid to the
tax collector.
3. Every such connection or installation shall bear interest and
penalties from the same time and at the same rate as assessments
for local improvements in the Township, and from the time of
confirmation shall be a first and paramount lien against the
respective property so connected with the sewer to the same extent

Application for the permit required by Section 13.04.040 shall be made
by the owner of the connection unit involved or by his or her authorized
representative to the Township's authorized agent on forms prescribed for
the application, together with fees as required by the Township Board of
Health.
§ 13.04.060. Notice of Connection. [Prior code § 11-1.6]
No person shall make or cause to be made a connection of any improved
property with a sewer until a permit approved by the authority has been
issued by the Township and until the person has given the authority's
engineer and the Township's authorized agent at least 48 hours' notice of
the time when the connection will be made, so that the Authority's engineer
and the Township's authorized agent may supervise and inspect the work of
connection and the installation from the foundation line of the improvement
as assessments for local improvements and shall be collected and
enforced in the same manner.
4. No such charge for sewer connections or toilet installation shall be
invalid by reason of any error or omission in stating the name of the
owner or owners of properties affected by the connections or toilet
installations, nor for any other informality, where the property has
actually been improved by the sewer connection or toilet
installation.
5. The Township may provide for the payment of the same in
installments in the same manner as assessments for local
improvements are payable in the Township, in which case the
installments shall bear the same rate of interest and be collected
and enforced in the same manner as are installments for
assessments on local improvements.
6. The Township may award contracts for the construction of sewer
connections or toilet installations in the same manner and after the
same advertising as in the case of other contracts; and may, in lieu
of awarding separate contracts, award a contract, to the lowest
responsible bidder, for making all connections or installations of
toilets, which the Township may desire to have made within a
period of one year or less.
§ 13.04.030 CODE ADOPTION § 13.04.060
1.01:281
to the connection point and when necessary supervise in testing of the
connection.
§ 13.04.070. Grouping of Connections. [Prior code § 11-1.7]
Connection units to be connected to the sanitary sewer system shall be
connected separately and independently with a single building sewer
connected to a service lateral. Grouping of more than one connection
unit on one building sewer shall not be permitted, except under special
circumstances and for good cause shown to the Authority's engineer and
then only after special written permission of the Authority.
§ 13.04.080. Costs and Expenses. [Prior code § 11-1.8]
All costs and expenses of construction of a building sewer and costs and
expenses of connection of a building sewer to a collection sewer or service
lateral shall be borne by the owner of the connection unit to be connected;
and the owner shall indemnify and save harmless the Township and the
Authority from all loss or damage that may be occasioned directly or
indirectly, as a result of construction of a building sewer or of connection of
a building sewer to a service lateral.

20-01]
The Township of Raritan will use the following mechanisms to satisfy its
affordable housing obligations:
A. A Rehabilitation Program.
1. The Township of Raritan and FSHC have agreed that the
Township's indigenous need rehabilitation obligation is 16 units.
The Township shall continue to sponsor a local rehabilitation
program sufficient to satisfy its present need obligation of 16 units.
The Township shall establish a rehabilitation program manual. In
the event the Township satisfies its rehabilitation obligation, it will
continue to implement its rehabilitation program, and any
§ 15.20.020 RARITAN CODE § 15.20.030
1.01:320
additional units that are rehabilitated may be credited towards any
future affordable housing obligations, if permitted by applicable
law and regulations. The Township will continue its rehabilitation
program to update and renovate deficient housing units occupied
by low- and moderate-income households such that, after
rehabilitation, these units will comply with the New Jersey State
Housing Code pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:28. The Township will
continue to rehabilitate housing units to improve its housing stock
and to continue to provide indigenous need affordable units.
2. All rehabilitated rental and owner-occupied units shall remain
affordable to low- and moderate-income households for a period of
10 years (the control period). For owner-occupied units, the control
period will be enforced with a lien, and for renter-occupied units,
the control period will be enforced with a deed restriction.
3. The Township of Raritan shall dedicate an average of $10,000 for
each unit to be rehabilitated through this program, reflecting the
minimum hard cost of rehabilitation for each unit.
4. The Township of Raritan will continue to administer the
rehabilitation program in accordance with N.J.A.C. 5:93.1, et seq.10
5. Units in a rehabilitation program shall be exempt from N.J.A.C.
5:93-911 and UHAC requirements, but shall be administered in
accordance with the following:
a. If a unit is vacant, upon initial rental subsequent to
rehabilitation, or if a renter-occupied unit is rerented prior to
the end of controls on affordability, the deed restriction shall
require the unit to be rented to a low- or moderate-income
household at an affordable rent and affirmatively marketed
pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:93-912 and UHAC.
b. If a unit is renter-occupied, upon completion of the
rehabilitation, the maximum rate of rent shall be the lesser of
the current rent or the maximum permitted rent pursuant to
N.J.A.C. 5:93-913 and UHAC.
c. Rents in rehabilitated units may increase annually based on
the standards in N.J.A.C. 5:93-914 or the standards issued by a
New Jersey administrative agency with proper authority to
issue such standards.
d. Applicant and/or tenant households shall be certified as
income-eligible in accordance with N.J.A.C. 5:93-915 and UHAC,

except that households in owner-occupied units shall be
exempt from the regional asset limit.
B. Percentage of Mandatory Set-Asides for All Future Residential
Developments.
1. If the Township or a Township Planning Board or Zoning Board of
Adjustment permits the construction of multifamily or single-family
attached residential development that is "approvable" and
"developable," as defined at N.J.A.C. 5:93-1.3,16 the Township or the
Township's Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment shall
require that an appropriate percentage of the residential units be
set aside for low- and moderate-income households. This
requirement shall apply beginning with the effective date of this
chapter to any multifamily or single-family attached residential
development, including the residential portion of a mixed-use
project, which consists of five or more new residential units,
whether permitted by a zoning amendment, a variance granted by
the Township's Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, or
adoption of a redevelopment plan or amended redevelopment plan
in areas in need of redevelopment or rehabilitation. For any such
development for which the Township's land use ordinances (e.g.,
zoning or an adopted redevelopment plan) already permitted
residential development as of the effective date of this chapter, this
requirement shall only apply if the Township or the Township's
Zoning Board of Adjustment permits an increase in approvable and
developable gross residential density to at least twice the
permitted approvable and developable gross residential density as
of the effective date of this chapter. Nothing in this subsection
precludes the Township or the Township's Zoning Board of
Adjustment from imposing an affordable housing set-aside in a
development not required to have a set-aside pursuant to this
subsection consistent with N.J.S.A. 52:27D-311h and other
applicable law. For inclusionary projects in which the low and
moderate units are to be offered for sale, the appropriate set-aside
percentage is 20%; for projects in which the low- and moderateincome
units are to be offered for rent, the appropriate set-aside
percentage is 15%. This requirement does not create any
entitlement for a property owner or applicant for a zoning
amendment, variance, or adoption of a redevelopment plan or
amended redevelopment plan in areas in need of redevelopment or
rehabilitation, or for approval of any particular proposed project.
This requirement does not apply to any sites or specific zones
otherwise identified in the Township's Settlement Agreement with
FSHC dated June 14, 2019, or in the Township's Housing Element
and Fair Share Plan, for which density and set-aside standards shall
be governed by the specific standards set forth therein.

§ 15.20.030 RARITAN CODE § 15.20.030
1.01:322
2. Furthermore, this section shall not apply to developments
containing four or fewer dwelling units. All subdivision and site
plan approvals of qualifying residential developments shall be
conditioned upon compliance with the provisions of this section.
Where a developer demolishes existing dwelling units and builds
new dwelling units on the same site, the provisions of this section
shall apply only if the net number of dwelling units is five or more.
C. Phasing. Inclusionary developments shall be subject to the following
schedule, except where an alternate phasing schedule has been
incorporated into a development or redevelopment agreement:
Minimum Percentage of Lowand
Moderate-Income Units
Completed
Maximum Percentage of
Market-Rate Units Completed
0 25
10 25 + 1 unit
50 50
75 75
100 90
D. Fractional Units. If 15% or 20% of the total number of units in a
development results in a fraction or decimal, the developer shall be
required to provide an additional affordable unit on site.
Example: An eight-unit development requiring an affordable housing
set-aside of 1.6 units is proposed. The developer is required to provide

1. In establishing rents and sales prices of affordable housing units,
the administrative agent shall follow the procedures set forth in
UHAC utilizing the regional income limits published by HUD, which
includes the regional weighted average of uncapped Section 8
income limits and using calculation procedures approved by the
Court. Income limits for all units that are part of the Township's
Housing Element and Fair Share Plan and for which income limits
are not already established through a federal program exempted
from the UHAC pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.1 et seq. shall be
updated by the Township annually within 30 days of the publication
of determinations of median income by the Department of Housing
and Urban Development ("HUD") as follows:
20.Editor's Note: See now N.J.A.C. 5:23-3.14(b).
21.Editor's Note: See now N.J.A.C. 5:23-3.14(b).
§ 15.20.040 RARITAN CODE § 15.20.040
1.01:326
a. Regional income limits shall be established for the region that
the Township is located within based on the median income by
household size, which shall be established by a regional
weighted average of the uncapped Section 8 income limits
published by HUD. To compute this regional income limit, the
HUD determination of median county income for a family of
four is multiplied by the estimated households within the
county according to the most recent decennial Census. The
resulting product for each county within the housing region is
summed. The sum is divided by the estimated total households
from the most recent decennial Census in the Township's
housing region. This quotient represents the regional weighted
average of median income for a household of four. The income
limit for a moderate-income unit for a household of four shall
be 80% of the regional weighted average median income for a
family of four. The income limit for a low-income unit for a
household of four shall be 50% of the HUD determination of
the regional weighted average median income for a family of
four. The income limit for a very-low-income unit for a
household of four shall be 30% of the regional weighted
average median income for a family of four. These income
limits shall be adjusted by household size based on multipliers
used by HUD to adjust median income by household size. In no
event shall the income limits be less than those for the previous
year.
b. The income limits are the result of applying the percentages
set forth in Subsection C.1.a above to HUD's determination of
median income for the fiscal year 2019, and shall be utilized
until the Township updates the income limits after HUD has
published revised determinations of median income for the
next fiscal year.
c. The regional asset limit used in determining an applicant's
eligibility for affordable housing pursuant to N.J.A.C.
5:80-26.16(b)3 shall be calculated by the Township annually by
taking the percentage increase of the income limits calculated
pursuant to Subsection C.1.a above over the previous year's
income limits, and applying the same percentage increase to
the regional asset limit from the prior year. In no event shall
the regional asset limit be less than that for the previous year.
d. In establishing sale prices and rents of affordable housing
units, the Township's administrative agent shall follow the
procedures set forth in UHAC, utilizing the regional income
limits established pursuant to the process defined above:
i. The resale prices of owner-occupied low- and moderateincome
units may increase annually based on the
percentage increase in the regional median income limit
for each housing region determined pursuant to the above
§ 15.20.040 CODE ADOPTION § 15.20.040
1.01:327
methodology. In no event shall the maximum resale price
established by the administrative agent be lower than the
last recorded purchase price.
ii. The rent levels of very-low-, low- and moderate-income
units may be increased annually based on the percentage
increase in the Housing Consumer Price Index for the
Northeast Urban Area, upon its publication for the prior
calendar year. This increase shall not exceed 9% in any one
year. Rents for units constructed pursuant to low-income
housing tax credit regulations shall be indexed pursuant to
the regulations governing low-income housing tax credits.
2. The maximum rent for restricted rental units within each
affordable development shall be affordable to households earning
no more than 60% of median income, and the average rent for
restricted low- and moderate-income units shall be affordable to
households earning no more than 52% of median income.
3. The developers and/or municipal sponsors of restricted rental units
shall establish at least one rent for each bedroom type for both lowincome
and moderate-income units.
a. At least 13% of all low- and moderate-income dwelling units
shall be affordable to households earning no more than 30% of
median income.
4. The maximum sales price of restricted ownership units within each
affordable development shall be affordable to households earning
no more than 70% of median income, and each affordable
development must achieve an affordability average of 55% for
restricted ownership units; in achieving this affordability average,
moderate-income ownership units must be available for at least
three different prices for each bedroom type, and low-income
ownership units must be available for at least two different prices
for each bedroom type.
5. In determining the initial sales prices and rents for compliance with
the affordability average requirements for restricted units other
than assisted living facilities, the following standards shall be used:
a. A studio shall be affordable to a one-person household;
b. A one-bedroom unit shall be affordable to a one-and-one-halfperson
household;
c. A two-bedroom unit shall be affordable to a three-person
household;
d. A three-bedroom unit shall be affordable to a four-and-one-halfperson
household;
§ 15.20.040 RARITAN CODE § 15.20.040
1.01:328
e. A four-bedroom unit shall be affordable to a six-person
household.
6. In determining the initial rents for compliance with the
affordability average requirements for restricted units in assisted
living facilities, the following standards shall be used:
a. A studio shall be affordable to a one-person household;
b. A one-bedroom unit shall be affordable to a one-and-one-halfperson
household;
c. A two-bedroom unit shall be affordable to a two-person
household or to two one-person households.
7. The initial purchase price for all restricted ownership units shall be
calculated so that the monthly carrying cost of the unit, including
principal and interest (based on a mortgage loan equal to 95% of
the purchase price and the Federal Reserve H.15 rate of interest),
taxes, homeowner and private mortgage insurance and
condominium or homeowner association fees do not exceed 28% of
the eligible monthly income of the appropriate size household as
determined under N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.4, as may be amended and
supplemented; provided, however, that the price shall be subject to
the affordability average requirement of N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.3, as may
be amended and supplemented.
8. The initial rent for a restricted rental unit shall be calculated so as
not to exceed 30% of the eligible monthly income of the appropriate
household size as determined under N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.4, as may be
amended and supplemented; provided, however, that the rent shall
be subject to the affordability average requirement of N.J.A.C.
5:80-26.3, as may be amended and supplemented.
9. The price of owner-occupied low- and moderate-income units may
increase annually based on the percentage increase in the regional
median income limit for each housing region. In no event shall the
maximum resale price established by the administrative agent be
lower than the last recorded purchase price.
10. The rent of very-low-, low- and moderate-income units may be
increased annually based on the percentage increase in the
Housing Consumer Price Index for the United States. This increase
shall not exceed 9% in any one year. Rents for units constructed
pursuant to low-income housing tax credit regulations shall be
indexed pursuant to the regulations governing low-income housing
tax credits.
11. Utilities. Tenant-paid utilities that are included in the utility
allowance shall be so stated in the lease and shall be consistent
with the utility allowance approved by DCA for its Section 8
program.

§ 15.20.050. Affirmative Marketing Requirements. [2-4-2020 by
Ord. No. 20-01]
A. The Township of Raritan shall adopt by resolution an Affirmative

marketed by a developer, sponsor or owner of affordable housing. The
Affirmative Marketing Plan is also intended to target those potentially
eligible persons who are least likely to apply for affordable units in that
region. It is a continuing program that directs all marketing activities
toward Housing Region 4 and covers the period of deed restriction.
C. The Affirmative Marketing Plan shall provide a regional preference for
all households that live and/or work in Housing Region 4.

Housing Resource Center.
K. The costs of advertising and affirmative marketing of the affordable
units shall be the responsibility of the developer, sponsor or owner,
unless otherwise determined or agreed to by the Township.
A. In referring certified households to specific restricted units, to the
extent feasible, and without causing an undue delay in occupying the
unit, the administrative agent shall strive to:
1. Provide an occupant for each bedroom;
2. Provide children of different sex with separate bedrooms;
3. Provide separate bedrooms for parents and children; and
4. Prevent more than two persons from occupying a single bedroom.
B. Additional provisions related to occupancy standards (if any) shall be

each restricted ownership unit shall remain subject to the requirements
of this chapter until the Township of Raritan elects to release the unit
from such requirements; however, and prior to such an election, a
restricted ownership unit must remain subject to the requirements of
N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.1 et seq., as may be amended and supplemented, for at
least 30 years.
B. The affordability control period for a restricted ownership unit shall
commence on the date the initial certified household takes title to the

D. At the time of the first sale of the unit, the purchaser shall execute and
deliver to the administrative agent a recapture note obligating the
purchaser (as well as the purchaser's heirs, successors and assigns) to
repay, upon the first nonexempt sale after the unit's release from the
requirements of this chapter, an amount equal to the difference
between the unit's nonrestricted fair market value and its restricted

paid by low- and moderate-income purchasers and those paid by market
purchases.
D. The owners of restricted ownership units may apply to the

§ 15.20.100. Limitations on Indebtedness Secured by Ownership
Unit; Subordination. [2-4-2020 by Ord. No. 20-01]
A. Buyer income eligibility for restricted ownership units shall be in
accordance with N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.1 et seq., as may be amended and
supplemented, such that low-income ownership units shall be reserved
for households with a gross household income less than or equal to 50%

reserved for households with a gross household income less than 80%
of median income. Very-low-income units shall be reserved for
households with a gross household income of less than 30% of median
income.
B. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the administrative agent may, upon
approval by the Township Committee, and subject to the Court's
approval, permit a moderate-income purchaser to buy a low-income
unit, if and only if the administrative agent can demonstrate that there
is an insufficient number of eligible low-income purchasers in the
housing region to permit prompt occupancy of the unit, and all other
reasonable efforts to attract a low-income purchaser, including pricing
and financing incentives, have failed. Any such low-income unit that is
sold to a moderate-income household shall retain the required pricing
and pricing restrictions for a low-income unit.
C. A certified household that purchases a restricted ownership unit must
occupy it as the certified household's principal residence and shall not
lease the unit; provided, however, that the administrative agent may
permit the owner of a restricted ownership unit, upon application and a
showing of hardship, to lease the restricted unit to another certified
household for a period not to exceed one year. Violations of this
provision shall be subject to the applicable enforcement provisions of
Section 15.20.150 of this chapter.
D. The administrative agent shall certify a household as eligible for a
restricted ownership unit when the household is a low-income

(including principal, interest, taxes, homeowner and private mortgage
insurance and condominium or homeowner association fees, as
applicable) does not exceed 33% of the household's certified monthly
income.
A. Prior to incurring any indebtedness to be secured by a restricted
ownership unit, the administrative agent shall determine in writing that
the proposed indebtedness complies with the provisions of this section.

control period, neither an owner nor a lender shall at any time cause or
permit the total indebtedness secured by a restricted ownership unit to

price is determined by the administrative agent in accordance with
N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.6(b).
A. The owners of restricted ownership units may apply to the
administrative agent to increase the maximum sales price for the unit
on the basis of capital improvements made since the purchase of the
unit. Eligible capital improvements shall be those that render the unit
suitable for a larger household or that add an additional bathroom. In
no event shall the maximum sales price of an improved housing unit
exceed the limits of affordability for the larger household.
B. Upon the resale of a restricted ownership unit, all items of property that
are permanently affixed to the unit or were included when the unit was
initially restricted (for example, refrigerator, range, washer, dryer,
dishwasher, wall-to-wall carpeting) shall be included in the maximum
allowable resale price. Other items may be sold to the purchaser at a
reasonable price that has been approved by the administrative agent at
the time of the signing of the agreement to purchase. The purchase of
central air-conditioning installed subsequent to the initial sale of the
unit and not included in the base price may be made a condition of the
unit resale, provided the price, which shall be subject to ten-year,
straight-line depreciation, has been approved by the administrative
agent. Unless otherwise approved by the administrative agent, the
purchase of any property other than central air-conditioning shall not
be made a condition of the unit resale. The owner and the purchaser
must personally certify at the time of closing that no unapproved
transfer of funds for the purpose of selling and receiving property has
taken place at the time of or as a condition of resale.
A. Control periods for restricted rental units shall be in accordance with
N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.11, as may be amended and supplemented, and each
restricted rental unit shall remain subject to the requirements of this
chapter until the Township of Raritan elects to release the unit from

1. The municipality may file a Court action pursuant to N.J.S.A.
2A:58-11 alleging a violation, or violations, of the regulations
governing the affordable housing unit. If the owner, developer or
tenant is found by the Court to have violated any provision of the
regulations governing affordable housing units, the owner,
developer or tenant shall be subject to one or more of the following
penalties, at the discretion of the Court:
a. A fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment for a period
not to exceed 90 days, or both. Each and every day that the
violation continues or exists shall be considered a separate and
specific violation of these provisions and not as a continuing
offense;
b. In the case of an owner who has rented his or her low- or
moderate-income unit in violation of the regulations governing
affordable housing units, payment into the Township of Raritan
Affordable Housing Trust Fund of the gross amount of rent
illegally collected;
c. In the case of an owner who has rented his or her low- or
moderate-income unit in violation of the regulations governing
affordable housing units, payment of an innocent tenant's

2. The municipality may file a Court action in the Superior Court
seeking a judgment which would result in the termination of the
owner's equity or other interest in the unit, in the nature of a
mortgage foreclosure. Any judgment shall be enforceable as if the
same were a judgment of default of the First Purchase Money
Mortgage and shall constitute a lien against the low- and moderateincome
unit.
C. Such judgment shall be enforceable, at the option of the municipality,
by means of an execution sale by the Sheriff, at which time the low- and
moderate-income unit of the violating owner shall be sold at a sale price
which is not less than the amount necessary to fully satisfy and pay off
any First Purchase Money Mortgage and prior liens and the costs of the
enforcement proceedings incurred by the municipality, including
attorney's fees. The violating owner shall have the right to possession
terminated as well as the title conveyed pursuant to the Sheriff's sale.
D. The proceeds of the Sheriff's sale shall first be applied to satisfy the
First Purchase Money Mortgage lien and any prior liens upon the lowand
moderate-income unit. The excess, if any, shall be applied to
§ 15.20.150 CODE ADOPTION § 15.20.150
1.01:341
reimburse the municipality for any and all costs and expenses incurred
in connection with either the Court action resulting in the judgment of
violation or the Sheriff's sale. In the event that the proceeds from the
Sheriff's sale are insufficient to reimburse the municipality in full as
aforesaid, the violating owner shall be personally responsible for and to
the extent of such deficiency, in addition to any and all costs incurred
by the municipality in connection with collecting such deficiency. In
the event that a surplus remains after satisfying all of the above, such
surplus, if any, shall be placed in escrow by the municipality for the
owner and shall be held in such escrow for a maximum period of two
years or until such earlier time as the owner shall make a claim with the
municipality for such. Failure of the owner to claim such balance within
the two-year period shall automatically result in a forfeiture of such
balance to the municipality. Any interest accrued or earned on such
balance while being held in escrow shall belong to and shall be paid to
the municipality, whether such balance shall be paid to the owner or
forfeited to the municipality.
E. Foreclosure by the municipality due to violation of the regulations
governing affordable housing units shall not extinguish the restrictions
of the regulations governing affordable housing units as the same apply
to the low- and moderate-income unit. Title shall be conveyed to the
purchaser at the Sheriff's sale, subject to the restrictions and provisions
of the regulations governing the affordable housing unit. The owner
determined to be in violation of the provisions of this plan and from
whom title and possession were taken by means of the Sheriff's sale
shall not be entitled to any right of redemption.
F. If there are no bidders at the Sheriff's sale, or if insufficient amounts
are bid to satisfy the First Purchase Money Mortgage and any prior
liens, the municipality may acquire title to the low- and moderateincome
unit by satisfying the First Purchase Money Mortgage and any
prior liens and crediting the violating owner with an amount equal to
the difference between the First Purchase Money Mortgage and any
prior liens and costs of the enforcement proceedings, including legal
fees and the maximum resale price for which the low- and moderateincome
unit could have been sold under the terms of the regulations
governing affordable housing units. This excess shall be treated in the
same manner as the excess which would have been realized from an
actual sale as previously described.
G. Failure of the low- and moderate-income unit to be either sold at the
Sheriff's sale or acquired by the municipality shall obligate the owner to
accept an offer to purchase from any qualified purchaser which may be
referred to the owner by the municipality, with such offer to purchase
being equal to the maximum resale price of the low- and moderateincome
unit as permitted by the regulations governing affordable
housing units.

H. The owner shall remain fully obligated, responsible and liable for
complying with the terms and restrictions of governing affordable
housing units until such time as title is conveyed from the owner.

successor agency at the state level. The reporting shall include an
accounting of all Affordable Housing Trust Fund activity, including the
source and amount of funds collected and the amount and purpose for
which any funds have been expended.

mechanisms continue to present a realistic opportunity and
whether the mechanisms to meet unmet need should be revised or
supplemented. Such posting shall invite any interested party to
submit comments to the Township, with a copy to Fair Share
Housing Center, regarding whether any sites no longer present a
realistic opportunity and should be replaced and whether the
mechanisms to meet unmet need should be revised or
supplemented. Any interested party may by motion request a
hearing before the Court regarding these issues.
2. For the review of very-low-income housing requirements required
by N.J.S.A. 52:27D-329.1 et seq., within 30 days of the third

Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Objectives
§ 15.24.010. Statutory Authorization. [Amended by Ord. 09-16]
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1, et
seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general welfare

§ 15.24.020. Findings of Fact. [Amended by Ord. 09-16]
§ 15.24.030. Statement of Purpose. [Amended by Ord. 09-16]
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
A. The flood hazard areas of Township of Raritan are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, causes damage in other
areas. Uses that are inadequately flood proofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. To protect human life and health;
B. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
C. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
F. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;
G. To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area
of special flood hazard; and

In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
H. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

B. Conditions for Variances.
1. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that the
items in Subsection A.4.a through k have been fully considered. As
the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
2. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
3. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
4. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
5. Variances shall only be issued upon:
a. A showing of good and sufficient cause;
b. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and,
c. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public as identified in Subsection A.4, or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
6. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
§ 15.24.150 RARITAN CODE § 15.24.150
1.01:356
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

specific piece of property, or by reason of other extraordinary and

property, a variance from such strict application of such regulation so
as to relieve such difficulties or hardship, including a variance for
conditional use; provided, however, that no variance shall be granted
under this section to allow a structure or use in a district restricted
against such structure or use; and provided further that the proposed
development does not require approval by the Planning Board of a
subdivision, site plan or conditional use in conjunction with which the
Planning Board shall review a request for a variance pursuant to
Section 47a of the Municipal Land Use Law;
D. In particular cases and for special reasons, grant a variance to allow

members.
No variance or other relief may be granted under the terms of this
section unless such variance or other relief can be granted without
substantial detriment to the public good and will not substantially
impair the intent and the purpose of the zone plan and zoning
ordinance. An application under this section may be referred to any
appropriate person or agency, including the Planning Board pursuant
to Section 17 of the Municipal Land Use Law, for its report; provided
that such reference shall not extend the period of time within which the
Zoning Board of Adjustment shall act;
E. Where the enforcement of Section 16.64.090.E of the zoning ordinance
would entail practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, or where the
circumstances of the case do not require the building or structure to be
related to a street, the Board of Adjustment may upon application or
appeal, vary the application or Section 16.64.090.E and direct the
issuance of a permit subject to conditions that will provide adequate
access for firefighting, ambulances and other emergency vehicles
necessary for the protection of health and safety and that will protect
any future street layout shown on the official map or on the general
circulation plan element of the Township Master Plan;

extent and subject to the same restrictions as the Planning Board
subdivision or site plan approval pursuant to Chapters 16.18 and 16.20
or conditional use approval pursuant to Article 3 of the Municipal Land
Use Law whenever the proposed development requires approval by the
Board of Adjustment of a variance pursuant to Subsection D of this
section. The developer may elect to submit a separate application
requesting approval of the variance and a subsequent application for
any required approval of a subdivision, site plan or conditional use. The
separate approval of the variance shall be conditioned upon grant of all
required subsequent approvals by the Board of Adjustment. No such
subsequent approval shall be granted unless such approval can be
granted without substantial impairment of the intent and purpose of the
zone plan and zoning ordinance. The number of votes of Board
members required to grant any such subsequent approval shall be as
otherwise provided in this chapter for the approval in question, and the
special vote pursuant to Subsection D of this section shall not be
required;

grant or deny approval of the application within 120 days after
submission by a developer of a complete application to the
Administrative Officer or within such further time as may be consented
to by the applicant. In the event that the developer elects to submit
separate consecutive applications, the aforesaid provision shall apply to
the application for approval of the variance. The period for granting or
denying any subsequent approval shall be as otherwise provided in this
Code. Failure of the Board of Adjustment to act within the period
described shall constitute approval of the application and a certificate
of the Administrative Officer as to the failure of the Board of Adjustment
to act shall be issued on request of the applicant, and it shall be
sufficient in lieu of the written endorsement or other evidence of
approval;
J. Whenever review or approval of the application by the County Planning
Board is required by Sections 5 of P.L. 1968, c. 285 (C-40:27 - 6.3), in

(C-40:27-6.6), in the case of a site plan, the Board of Adjustment shall

report on the application by the County Planning Board or approval by
the County Planning Board by its failure to report thereon within the
required time.
An application under this section may be referred to any appropriate
person or agency, including the Planning Board for its report; provided
that such reference shall not extend the period of time within which the
Zoning Board of Adjustment shall act.
A. Appeals. Appeals to the Board of Adjustment may be taken by an
interested party affected by any decision of an Administrative Officer of
the Township based on or made in the enforcement of the zoning

specifying the grounds of such appeal. The officer from whom the
appeal is taken shall immediately transmit to the Board all papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.

development with the Board of Adjustment for action under any of its
powers without prior application to an Administrative Officer.

1.01:404
was made. Unless the officer, from whose action the appeal is taken,
certifies to the Board of Adjustment after the notice of appeal shall have
been filed with him or her that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate,
a stay would, in his or her opinion, cause eminent peril to life or property.
In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by an order of the
superior court upon notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and
on due cause shown.
§ 16.04.060. Modification on Appeal. [Prior code § 15-2.6]

A. The Township Committee of the Township of Raritan finds and declares
that the creation and preservation of affordable housing in the
Township serves the public interest. Maintaining and improving a stock
of sound affordable housing requires affirmative steps by local
government working cooperatively with public bodies at all levels and
with the private sector.
B. The New Jersey Supreme Court in Holmdel Builder's Ass'n v. Holmdel
Township, 121 N.J. 550 (1990), determined that mandatory
development fees are authorized by the Fair Housing Act of 1985,
N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 et seq., and the State Constitution.

§ 16.10.020. Basic Requirements. [Amended by Ord. 09-13]
§ 16.10.030. Definitions. [Amended by Ord. 09-13]
necessary for the establishment, implementation, review, monitoring
and enforcement of municipal affordable housing trust funds and
corresponding spending plans. Municipalities that are under the
jurisdiction of the Council or court of competent jurisdiction and have
a COAH-approved spending plan may retain fees collected from nonresidential
development.
D. The purpose of this subsection is to establish standards for the

subsection shall be used for the sole purpose of providing low- and
moderate-income housing. This subsection shall be interpreted within
the framework of COAH's regulations on development fees, including
N.J.A.C. 5:97-8, and as may be amended.

1. Within all residential and nonresidential zones now existing, or as
may hereafter be created, including, but not limited to, the R-1,
R-1A, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6, R-6LM, R-7, R-8, R-9, and AR Zone

period preceding the filing of the variance application. Example: If
an approval allows four units to be constructed on a site that was

1.01:418
§ 16.10.050. Eligible Exactions, Ineligible Exactions and
Exemptions. [Amended by Ord. 09-13]
zoned for two units, the fees could equal 1 1/2% of the equalized
assessed value on the first two units; and the specified higher
percentage up to 6% of the equalized assessed value for the two
additional units, provided zoning on the site has not changed
during the two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance
application.

may hereafter be created, including, but not limited to, the I-1, I-2,

development specifically exempted, shall also pay a fee equal to
2.5% of the increase in equalized assessed value resulting from any
additions to existing structures to be used for non-residential
purposes.
3. Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing
non-residential structure is demolished and replaced. The
development fee of 2.5% shall be calculated on the difference
between the equalized assessed value of the pre-existing land and
improvements and the equalized assessed value of the newly
improved structure, i.e. land and improvement, at the time final
certificate of occupancy is issued. If the calculation required under
this section results in a negative number, the non-residential
development fee shall be zero.
A. Affordable housing developments, developments where the developer is
providing for the construction of affordable units elsewhere in the
Township, and developments where the developer has made a payment
in lieu of on-site construction of affordable units shall be exempt from
development fees.
B. Residential developments that have received preliminary or final site
plan approval prior to the effective date of the initial development fee
ordinance codified in this subsection shall be exempt from paying a
development fee, unless the developer seeks a substantial change in the
approval. Where a site plan approval does not apply, a zoning and/or
building permit shall be synonymous with preliminary and final site
plan approval for this purpose. The fee percentage shall be vested on
the date that the building permit is issued.
§ 16.10.040 CODE ADOPTION § 16.10.050

development shall be subject to the 2.5% development fee, unless
otherwise exempted below.

resulting from alterations, change in use within existing footprint,
reconstruction, renovations and repairs to non-residential
developments.
F. Non-residential developments shall be exempt from the payment of
non-residential development fees in accordance with the exemptions

development fee thereafter ceases to be exempt from
property taxation, the owner of the property shall remit the fees

development shall complete Form N-RDF as per the instructions
provided. The Construction Official shall verify the information

pay that estimated amount consistent with the dispute process set forth

at the time of the issuance of the building permit, with the remaining
portion to be collected at the issuance of the certificate of occupancy.
The developer shall be responsible for paying the difference between
the fee calculated at the issuance of the building permit and that
determined at the issuance of the certificate of occupancy.

§ 16.12.020. Right to Farm. [Amended by Ord. 94-37]
A. The right to farm land is recognized to exist in the Township and is
declared a permitted use in the following zones and subject to the
standards and regulations as set forth in the Development Regulations
of the Township: R-1, R-1A, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-6, I-1, I-2, O-2.
The following farming activities shall be deemed established as
acceptable, recognized and entitled to encouragement and protection
as the collective embodiment of the right to farm, subject in all cases,
however, to any supervening applicable federal, state, county or
municipal laws or regulations respecting the public health, safety or
otherwise:
1. Produce agricultural and horticultural crops, trees and forest
products, livestock, poultry and other related commodities;

Agencies for the control of pests, predators, varmints, diseases
affecting plants and livestock, and for the control of weed
infestation;
5. Clear woodlands using accepted techniques and install and
maintain vegetative and terrain alterations and other physical

For the purpose of giving due notice of nearby farming uses to proposed,
new residential areas adjacent to unimproved land then being farmed or
suitable therefor, the Planning Board shall require any applicant for an
adjacent major or minor subdivision, as a condition of approval of such
application, to include a provision in each and every deed conveying all
or any portion of the lands thereby subdivided, as well as on filed final
subdivision maps, the following record notice to grantees of such present or
future proximate farming uses, which provision shall be made to run with
the land:
Grantee hereby acknowledged NOTICE that there are presently, or may
in the future be farm uses adjacent or in close proximity to the within
described premises from which farm use may emanate noise, odors, dust,
6. Use irrigation pumps and equipment and undertake aerial and
ground seeding and spraying, using tractors and other necessary
equipment;
7. Hire and utilize necessary farm labor, except that any housing of
laborers shall only be permitted in existing residential dwellings on
the property and subject to all other standards set forth in this
chapter and any other governmental regulations;

use of the farmland which changes the underlying agricultural
nature of the use shall be subject to the usual prior site plan review,
variance application and all permits where otherwise required.
B. The foregoing uses, activities and rights when reasonable and
necessary for farming, livestock or fowl production and when
conducted in accordance with generally accepted agricultural
practices, may occur on holidays, Sundays and weekends by day or
night and shall include the attendant or incidental noise, odors, dust
and fumes associated with these practices.
C. It is determined that whatever nuisance may be caused to others by
these uses and activities is more than offset by the benefits from
farming to the neighborhood community and society in general by
preservation of open space, the beauty of the countryside and clean air.
The preservation and continuance of farming operations in Raritan
Township and New Jersey is a source of agricultural products for this
and future generations and saves a nonreplenishable resource, i.e., the
land.

and off-tract improvements; and any requirements peculiar to the
specific plan. The Township may modify by ordinance such general
terms and conditions of a preliminary approval as they may relate
to public health and safety, provided that such modifications are in
accord with amendments adopted by ordinance subsequent to
approval;
2. That the applicant may submit for final approval on or before the
expiration date of preliminary approval the whole or section or
sections of a particular plan.
G. Extension of Preliminary Approval. The applicant may apply for and the

report shall be performed to identify wetlands as defined by
the Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act, P.L. 1987, C. 156, to
identify the wetlands by type (ordinary, intermediate and
exception resource value) and to specify the required
transition area. On-site wetlands and transition areas required
for on-site wetlands shall be delineated. A transition area may
be located and required by the Freshwater Wetlands
Protection Act, P.L. 1987, C. 156 on a property even though the
freshwater wetlands adjacent to that transition area is located
on a different property. In such case, the transition area as
required shall be delineated. A report from the person or firm

development and estimated trip generation during
commuter peak hours of the street system in the area,
ii. Directional assignment of estimated trip generation to the
existing and any proposed street system, as appropriate,
iii. Review of traffic volumes existing on streets in the area.
(Existing acceptable traffic volumes may be utilized. If
such do not exist, traffic volume counts at 15 minute
intervals must be taken),
iv. Review of other development activity in the area and
consideration of trip generation from these other proposed
developments,
v. Project future background traffic volumes on affected
streets for build-out and intermediate development phase,
vi. Review of street, intersections, jug handles, ramps, etc., in
terms of traffic carrying capacity (such may be expressed
as a level of service) as may be affected by the proposed
development activity. No-build, build-out and intermediate
phases should be examined where appropriate,
vii. Identification of streets, intersections, jug handles, ramps,
etc., which anticipated levels of service or other

Administrative Officer of a complete application which involves 10
acres or less and 10 dwelling units or less in the case of a site plan, and
10 or fewer lots in the case of a subdivision, the Planning Board shall
grant or deny preliminary approval within 45 days of the date of such
submission or within such further time as may be consented to by the
§ 16.14.050 RARITAN CODE § 16.14.050
1.01:438
applicant; except that if the application also involves an application for
a variance pursuant to Section 16.04.030, the Board shall grant or deny
preliminary approval within 95 days of the submission of a complete
application to the Administrative Officer or within such further time as
may be consented to by the applicant.
Upon the submission of a complete application which involves more
than 10 acres or more than 10 dwelling units, or for a conditional use
approval in the case of a site plan, and more than 10 lots in the case
of a subdivision, the Planning Board shall grant or deny preliminary
approval and/or conditional use approval 95 days of the date of such
submission or within such further time as may be consented to by the
applicant.
The required time in which the Planning Board must act on an
application shall run from the date the application was submitted as
complete, no matter what date the Administrative Officer reviews the
application and finds it complete.
If the Planning Board requires any substantial amendment in the layout
of improvements proposed by the developer that have been the subject
of a hearing, an amended application for development shall be
submitted and proceeded upon, as in the case of the original application
for development.
D. Time Limitation. The Planning Board shall act within 45 days of
submission of a completed application for final approval at a regular
meeting or within such further time as may be mutually agreed upon,
except that in the case of a simultaneous submission of a preliminary
and final site plan, the time limit for preliminary review shall govern. If
the Planning Board approves the final plan, a notation to that effect
shall be made on each plat and signed by the Chairman and Secretary
of the Planning Board. Failure of the Planning Board to act within the
aforementioned time period shall be deemed to be favorable approval
and the Administrative Officer shall issue a certificate to that effect.
E. Filing. A final subdivision plat approval shall be filed by the subdivider
with the County Recording Officer within 95 days from the date of such
approval. If any final plat is not filed within that period, the approval
shall expire. For good cause, the Planning Board may extend the time
for the filing of the plat for an additional period not to exceed 95 days.
No plat shall be accepted for filing by the County Clerk unless it has
been duly approved by the Township Planning Board and signed by its
Chairman and Secretary, and approved by the County Planning Board
and signed by an authorized official.

§ 16.14.050 CODE ADOPTION § 16.14.050
1.01:439
conditionally or otherwise, shall not be changed for a period of
two years after the date of final approval; provided that in the
case of major subdivision the rights conferred by this chapter
shall expire if the plat has not been duly recorded within the time
period provided in Subsection E of this section. If the developer
has followed the standards prescribed for final approval, and, in
the case of a subdivision, has duly recorded the plat as required
in Subsection E of this section, the Planning Board may extend
such period of protection for extensions of one year but not to
exceed three extensions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this chapter, the granting of final approval terminates the time
period of preliminary approval pursuant to Section 16.14.040(F) for
the section granted final approval.
2. In the case of a subdivision or site plan for a planned development
of 50 acres or more, conventional subdivision or site plan for 150
acres or more, or site plan for development of a nonresidential floor
area 200,000 square feet or more the Planning Board may grant
the rights referred to in Subsection (F)(1) of this section for such
period of time, longer than two years, as shall be determined by the
Planning Board to be reasonable taking into consideration: (1) the
number of dwelling units and nonresidential floor area permissible
under final approval; (2) economic conditions; and (3) the
comprehensiveness of the development. The developer may apply
for thereafter, and the Planning Board may thereafter grant, an
extension of final approval for such additional period of time as
shall be determined by the Planning Board to be reasonable taking
into consideration: (1) the number of dwelling units and
nonresidential floor area permissible under final approval; (2) the
number of dwelling units and nonresidential floor area remaining
to be developed; (3) economic conditions; and (4) the
comprehensiveness of the development.
G. Conditions of Final Approval. The Planning Board may, as a condition of
final approval:
1. Grant final approval only for designated geographic sections of
development;
2. Grant final approval for certain work but require resubmission for
final approval for designated elements such as, but not limited to,
landscaping, signs, street furniture, etc., and require approval of
these elements as a prerequisite for a certificate of occupancy;
3. Condition the granting of a certificate of occupancy (temporary or
permanent) or zoning permit subject to the applicant or developer
or subsequent heirs or assignees meeting certain requirements
within a designated period of time, not to exceed one year, from the
date of issuance of the temporary certificate of occupancy or
zoning permit. This may include, but is not limited to, the
§ 16.14.050 RARITAN CODE § 16.14.050
1.01:440

improvements, re-evaluation of circulation pattern, etc.
H. Time Limits for Applications Involving "d" (40:55-70d) Variances Before
the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
1. If a variance is granted under the provisions of 40:55D-70d of the
Municipal Land Use Law ("d" variance), and the application is
bifurcated under provisions of 40:55D-76b. of the Municipal Land
Use Law, subdivision or site plan approval shall be secured within
12 months of the date of approval of the "d" bifurcated variance.
Should the applicant fail to obtain subdivision or site plan approval
within the twelve-month period, it shall be conclusively presumed
that the applicant has waived, withdrawn and abandoned his or her
application and all approvals, permissions, permits and variances
granted to the applicant shall lapse and be void. For good cause
the Board of Adjustment may, upon written application in advance
of the expiration and stating the reasons therefore, extend such
twelve-month time limit.
2. Any preliminary subdivision or preliminary site plan approval
granted by the Board of Adjustment shall be valid for a period of
not more than three years unless extended under the provisions of
40:55D-49 of the Municipal Land Use Law.

plan approval within such three-year period or extension thereto
granted by the Board of Adjustment, it shall be conclusively
presumed that the applicant has waived, withdrawn and
abandoned his or her application and all approvals, permission,
permits and variances granted to the applicant shall lapse and be
void.
3. Any final site plan that has been approved by the Board of
Adjustment shall be valid for not more than two years unless
extended under the provision of 40:55D-52 of the Municipal Land
Use Law. During such two-year period or extension thereof as may
be granted by the Board of Adjustment, the applicant shall have
obtained a construction permit and shall have commenced work on
the project and shall complete such project within one year from
the date of securing such construction permit. For good cause, the
Board of Adjustment may, upon written application in advance of
the expiration and stating the reasons therefore, extend the time
period for obtaining a construction permit, commencing work on
the project and completing work on the project.
If during such two-year period from the date of approval or any
extension thereof which may be granted by the Board of
Adjustment a construction permit has not bee secured and/or work
on the project has not commenced and/or the project has not been
completed within 12 months of such extended period granted by

appropriate manner. Only upon fulfillment of all conditions shall
any subdivision map or site plan be signed or any required building
permit, occupancy permit or zoning permit be issued or any on-site
construction commence.
2. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as preventing the
Municipal Agency from specifying a longer period of time within
which any specific condition must be fulfilled, or from granting,
upon written application in advance of the expiration stating the
reasons therefore, an extension of time for good cause shown.
3. For purposes of calculating the time period within which conditions

to the Township for all reasonable cost of the improvements not
installed, and upon receipt of the proceeds thereof, the Township shall
install such improvements and/or the Township may use such portions
of the performance guarantees as have been deposited in cash with the
Clerk to assure the completion of the improvements in accordance with
the terms of this Title and any applicable agreement.

40:55D-53 are posted to insure the proper installation and maintenance
during the performance period, of all improvements installed by the
developer/landowner in accordance with the approved plans,
specifications and any amendments thereto required for approval of the
development by the Planning Board/Board of Adjustment.
All on-tract improvements shall be maintained by the developer/
landowner as a condition of continued development, use and occupancy
of the property. On-tract drainage facilities, including detention and/
or retention basins, shall be maintained by the developer/landowner
unless accepted by the municipality at the satisfactory termination
of the performance period. All drainage ways or drainage structures
shall be contained within the drainage easement to permit access
by municipal maintenance personnel for inspections of the facilities
and for emergency repair of such drainage facilities. Said easements
or emergency repair shall not be deemed or in any way construed
§ 16.16.030 RARITAN CODE § 16.16.050
1.01:448
that the municipality is accepting a dedication or responsible for the
maintenance of the drainage facilities.
B. Snow Removal  Salting/Sanding. Until such time as the privately
owned, on-tract improvements installed by the developer have been
accepted into Township ownership as set forth in these development
regulations or deeded and turned over to a private homeowners'
association, the developer/landowner shall be responsible for the
removal of snow and sanding and/or salting of streets, roadways and
other areas or rights-of-way for passage. The developer/landowner shall
also be responsible for sweeping the streets, roadways, and rights of
way as soon as feasibly possible after the application of salt and/or sand
to remove any excess from the road surface. [Amended by Ord.
06-11]
C. Performance Guarantee Period. During the time period when the
developer/landowner is constructing improvements (performance
guarantee period), the developer/landowner shall remove all snow, and
salt and/or sand the roadway, street and right-of-way areas within the
tract to insure safe passage by all persons and vehicles. Failure to fulfill
such responsibility shall be deemed a breach and default of the
performance guarantee. If the Township, in the sole discretion of its
agents and employees, determine that the health, safety or welfare of
persons or property may be affected by the breach of responsibility and
performance by the developer/landowner, the Township in such
emergency situation shall be authorized to plow and remove snow and
sand and/or salt the road, street or right-of-way areas within the
development.
All costs incurred in the emergency action undertaken by the Township
shall be charged against and deducted from the performance guarantee
posted by the developer/landowner as a default of their responsibility
and obligations to perform under the guarantee. Any such emergency
action by the Township shall not be construed as undertaking of any
of the developer/landowner's continued obligations or responsibilities;
and shall further not be deemed or construed as an acceptance of
any proposed dedication of the improvement. The developer/landowner
shall indemnify and hold the Township harmless for any damages or
injuries to persons or property of the developer, the Township, or others
resulting from such emergency action, and such damages shall likewise
be charged against and deducted from the performance guarantee.
D. Billing. The Township Public Works Department shall keep detailed
records of the time, materials, equipment and men utilized for such
services within the developer/landowner's tract and same shall be
submitted to the Chief Financial Officer for billing the cost of such
snowplowing, sanding or salting at the current rate established by
resolution for such services by the Township Public Works Department
and on file in the Municipal Clerk's Office. The Township Chief Financial
Officer shall forward the bill for services to the developer/landowner
indicating the deduction to be made from the performance guarantee.

1.01:449
§ 16.16.060. Off-Tract Improvements Required. [Prior code
§ 15-6.6]
Every developer, as a condition of approval, shall be required to pay his or
her pro rata share of the cost of providing reasonable and necessary street
improvements and water, sewerage and drainage facilities, and easements
therefor, located outside the tract limits of the development but
necessitated or required by construction or improvements within such
development. The off-tract improvements for which the developer must
contribute shall be based on the circulation plan and the utility service
plan elements of the master plan. If no other property would obtain a
significant benefit from such improvements, the developer shall pay the
entire cost thereof. If other property within a related and common area
would obtain a benefit from such improvements, then the Planning Board
shall determine the proportionate cost of each element of the improvements
which shall be born by each developer or owner within such area. Where
a developer pays the amount determined as his or her pro rata share
under protest, he or she shall institute legal action within one year of such
E. Indemnification. The developer's agreement executed between the
Township and any developer shall provide that the developer:
1. Authorizes deductions from the escrow account for services under
this chapter; and
2. Acknowledges that arterial or through roads of the Township
receive top priority in snow plowing over secondary or
development roads and that the Township shall not be held liable
by the developer/landowner for any delays in plowing; and
3. Agrees to hold harmless and indemnify the Township and its
employees from any liability or damage to persons or property
resulting during the course of the Township fulfilling the
developer's responsibility in removing snow and sanding or salting
of the streets and roadways within the development or delays in
providing these services; and
4. Acknowledges that the providing of snow plowing, sanding or
salting services is not an acceptance and shall not be construed as
an acceptance of a dedication of any improvements from the
developer/landowner, nor shall such services be deemed as the
Township exercising any dominion or control of or over the
developer/landowner's property, but rather such services are being
provided on an interim basis to protect and insure the public
health, safety and welfare of persons due to the stage of
development of the tract.
F. The street clearing activity by the Township under this chapter shall not
apply to streets which are to remain in private ownership in planned
residential developments (P.R.D.'s) since their homeowners' association
must undertake the road maintenance responsibility.
§ 16.16.050 RARITAN CODE § 16.16.060
1.01:450
payment in order to preserve the right to a judicial determination as to the
fairness and reasonableness of such amount. Any site plan requiring offtract
improvements shall comply with the provisions and design standards
of this Title and the subdivision chapter as appropriate. Performance and
maintenance guarantees shall be provided in accordance with Sections
16.16.010 and 16.16.020 as appropriate. Extensions of existing roads,
waterlines and sanitary and storm sewers required as a condition of final
approval to service the development shall not be considered an off-tract
improvement.
§ 16.16.070. Transportation Improvement District One (TID-1).
[Prior code § 15-6.6a; amended by Ord. 90-5]
A. Circulation Improvement. Street widening, alignment, corrections,
channelization of intersections, construction of barriers, new or
improved traffic signalization, signs, curbs, sidewalks, trees, utility
improvements not covered elsewhere, the construction of new streets
and other similar street or traffic improvements. The owner or
developer's proportionate cost shall be in the ratio of the estimated
peak-hour traffic generated by the proposed development. The ratio
thus calculated shall be increased by 10% for contingencies.
B. Water Distribution Facilities. As required by franchised water supplier.
C. Stormwater and Drainage Improvements. Stormwater and drainage
improvements, including the installation, relocation or replacement of
storm sewers, culverts, bridges, catch basins, detention and retention
ponds, and the installation, relocation or replacement of other
appurtenances associated therewith. The owner's or subdivider's
proportionate cost shall be in the ratio of the estimated peak surface
runoff as proposed to be delivered into the existing system measured in
cubic feet per second to the sum of the deficient existing peak flow in
cubic feet per second for the existing system and the estimated peak
flow as proposed to be delivered. For the purposes of calculations, the
standards set forth in Section 16.84.040B, the stormwater control and
floodplain subchapter of this ordinance shall be used. The ratio thus
calculated shall be increased by 10% for contingencies.
D. Sanitary Sewer Facilities. As required by the Raritan Township
Municipal Utilities Authority.
E. Escrow Account. Where the proposed off-tract improvement is to be
undertaken at some future date, the moneys required for the
improvement shall be deposited to the credit of the Township in an
interest-bearing account until such time as the improvement is
constructed. If the off-tract improvement is not begun within 10 years of
deposit, all moneys and interest shall be returned to the applicant.
A. Purpose. The Township Committee finds that:
§ 16.16.060 CODE ADOPTION § 16.16.070
1.01:451
1. The Township is responsible for and committed to the provision of
an adequate system of transportation within the Township.
2. New residential and nonresidential development is aggregated in
certain development areas. Such development causes and imposes
demands on the Township transportation system.
3. Planning projection indicate that such development will continue
and will place ever increasing demands on the Township's
transportation system.
4. To the extent that such development in aggregated areas place
demands on the existing transportation system, these demands
which will necessitate significant improvements should be shifted
in a fair and reasonable manner from the public at large to the
developments actually creating the demands.
5. The Township Committee after careful consideration finds and
declares that it is necessary to establish a Transportation
Improvement District (TID-1) and that the TID-1 contribution
imposed upon residential and nonresidential development in order
to finance transportation improvements within the TID-1 area, the
demand for which is created by both the residential and
nonresidential development, is in the best interest of the general
welfare of the Township and its residents and is equitable.
B. Intent. This section is intended to impose a TID-1 contribution at the
time of certificate of occupancy issuance, (and as a condition precedent
to such issuance) in an amount based upon variables to reflect expected
trip generation from non  residential development, and number of
units of residential development, and to finance transportation
improvements, the demand for which is generated by new
developments within the TID-1 area. The Township is responsible for
meeting its fair share of such improvements reflecting existing
development and traffic volumes. After studies by the Township's
Traffic Consultant (Travers Associates, Inc. and Rocciola Engineering))
published in a report entitled Raritan Transportation Improvement
District No. 1, dated June, 1990 (hereinafter referred to as The Travers
Study - June, 1990) which was subsequently amended by Rocciola
Engineering and summarized in a memorandum report dated June 25,
2001, the Township's share has been established as 78% of the amount
specified in Subsection E of this section. Only needs created by new
development will be met by such TID-1 contribution. The TID-1
contribution shall be spent on transportation improvements that
substantially benefit those developments within the TID-1 area.
[Amended by Ord. 01-25]
C. Applicability. This section shall be uniformly applicable to development
that occurs within the designated TID-1 area.
§ 16.16.070 RARITAN CODE § 16.16.070
1.01:452
D. Establishment of TID-1. Pursuant to N.J.S. 40:55D-39 there is
established a Transportation Improvement District (TID-1) which shall
include the area bounded by:
Voorhees Corner Road (C.R. 650) on the north;
Old York Road between Voorhees Corner Road and Clover Hill
Road on the east;
Clover Hill Road between Old York Road and Amwell Road on
the east;
Amwell Road and Old York Road to Route 202/31 on the south;
Route 202/31 and Route 202 between Old York Road and
Voorhees Corner Road on the west.
The establishment of such TID-1 is in accordance with the
recommendations of the master plan of the Township of Raritan.
E. Improvements Costs. Based upon a traffic engineering review of the
TID-1 area as described, $9,519,000 of street and traffic control
improvements are deemed necessary within this area in current 2001
dollars. The Travers Associates Study - June, 1990 was amended by
Rocciola Engineering and summarized in a memorandum report dated
June 25, 2001; both documents are on file in the planning and zoning
office of the Township of Raritan. In 2001 dollars, after accounting for
TID-1 funds currently collected as of June 15th, 2001, the total
remaining cost is $8,792,761.45. That sum is broken down to
$6,858,353.93 as the Township responsibility and $1,934,407.52 as the
allocation that shall be borne on a pro rata basis as set forth in
Subsection F of this section. [Amended by Ord. 01-25]
F. Calculation of Contribution. Based upon counts of existing traffic
volumes and projected trip generation of uses within the TID-1, the
following is deemed the pro rata amount of the cost of such
improvements that shall be borne by each developer or owner with
respect to development applications within the TID-1 district.
[Amended by Ord. 01-25]
TID Fee Schedule
Land Use Unit Cost
Residential Home $1,076.00
Retail S.F. GLA $3.98 ($1.00 highway)

TID Fee Schedule
Land Use Unit Cost
Fast-food restaurant
w/drive-thru
S.F. $17.66 ($4.12 highway)
For uses not listed above the fee is calculated as follows:
TID FEE = $1055.13 x T x P x H
Where:
$1055.13= Cost per Trip
T = Peak Trip Hours
P = Percent of Primary Trips
H = 0.25 Highway Access Factor, where applicable
Combination of uses as part of a development shall be divided into
component parts based upon the appropriate formula above.
The methodology to determine the appropriate cost trip generation
shall be as established by the Travers Study - June, 1990 and as
amended by the Rocciola Engineering Memorandum dated June 25,
2001.
Where the property which is the subject of a development application
falls within TID-1, the pro rata amount of the cost of off-tract street
and traffic control improvements shall be borne by each developer or
owner with respect to such development application within the TID-1.
The TID-1 contribution shall be determined by the formula specified in
the TID fee schedule.
Any calculation based upon square footage of floor area shall be
deemed to be gross square footage which shall for the purpose of this
section extend to the exterior perimeter of such building or structure.
Any change of use necessitating a development application shall be
subject to a TID-1 contribution based upon the difference between the
existing trip generation and the anticipated trip generation based upon
the formula set forth herein when the anticipated trip generation is
greater than the existing trip generation. [Amended by Ord. 01-25]
G. Findings and Approvals. The Municipal Agency, in deliberation with
respect to any application for preliminary approval with regard to
property located within TID-1, shall consider, and make appropriate
findings, in concept form, as to amounts to be covered in a developer's
TID-1 contribution agreement.
A condition to any final approval shall be that the applicant enter
into an agreement with the Township of Raritan (developers TID-1
contribution agreement) based upon the findings of facts and
conditions of such approval, that will provide for the following:
§ 16.16.070 RARITAN CODE § 16.16.070
1.01:454
1. Payment of a TID-1 contribution fee representing the applicant's
fair share of street and traffic control improvements in accordance
with the standards set forth in this section including provision for
adjustment of such fee due to inflation.
Such fee shall be adjusted annually in January by applying the
construction cost index as published by McGraw-Hill Publishers
in the "Engineering News Record," or if such periodical is no
longer published, as published in another publication of similar
reputation and reliability. If, as of any relevant date, the Index is no
longer published or issued, the Federal Highway Administration's
bid price index or such other index as accurately reflects the effects
of general economic conditions and influences upon the cost of
constructing road improvements in New Jersey shall be used and
employed in the place and stead thereof;
2. A description of improvements to be made by or at the expense of
the developer, in lieu of a fee contribution or some combination
thereof, if any, and the timing or sequencing of such installation.
Such improvements shall only be permitted by the Municipal
Agency in lieu of TID-1 contribution if the Board finds, after
consultation with the Township Engineer, that such improvements
are a part of the TID-1 improvements set forth by the Township
Engineer in the Cost Estimate Breakdown dated April 20, 1989 as
amended by the Revised Table 4 (TID Improvement Cost Estimate)
prepared by the Township Engineer and dated December 12, 2000
and that such improvements are such that traffic operating
characteristics will be safe and adequate following completion of
such improvement.
3. Such other matters as may be recommended by the Municipal
agency. [Amended by Ord. 01-25]
H. Use of Funds Collected. Any funds collected by way of TID-1
contribution shall be maintained in a separate escrow account credited
to the Township. Such funds shall be used only for improvements
referred to in The Travers Study - June, 1990 as amended by the
Rocciola Engineering Memorandum dated June 25, 2001 and
specifically the Cost Estimate Breakdown dated April 20, 1989 as
amended by the Revised Table 4 (TID Improvement Cost Estimate)
prepared by the Township Engineer and dated December 12, 2000. The
Township shall publish a yearly notice in the official newspaper of the
Township indicating where TID-1 funds have been spent. [Amended by
Ord. 01-25]

[Prior code § 15-7.6]
A. Construction Permits Before Final Approval. No construction permit
shall be issued by the Construction Official for any dwellings, buildings
or structures within a subdivision until final approval is granted in the
case of major subdivision or approval is granted in the case of minor
subdivision.
B. Construction Permits Before Installation of Improvements. No
construction permit shall be issued by the Construction Official for any
dwellings, buildings or structures within a subdivision until all
improvements have been installed as shown on the minor subdivision
plat or preliminary subdivision plat, except that the Planning Board may

The Planning Board may authorize the issuance of a temporary
certificate of occupancy due to conditions, such as weather, which
are beyond the control of the developer if landscaping, permanent
sidewalks and other minor improvements specified by the Board have
been guaranteed but not yet installed. Prior to the issuance of more
than 50% of the temporary certificates of occupancy for a subdivision,
all improvements except the finish course of the road, if postponed by
the Township Engineer, shall have been constructed or installed.
If cases of planned residential developments or other large
subdivisions, the Planning Board may by resolution develop
requirements for the issuance of permanent and temporary certificates
of occupancy other than those stated heretofore if such flexibility
promotes a more reasonable and logical development scheme and
serves the best interest of the Township.

10. Fire Protection Systems. While recognizing that it may not be
possible to assure complete fire protection in every given case, in
order to provide the Raritan Township Fire Company with some
minimum fire fighting capability, all major subdivisions shall
provide for a source of water for fire fighting purposes in systems
approved by the Township Fire Marshal and Fire Chief and in
accordance with the following criteria:
a. Where an existing public water supply is available and has
been approved by the Raritan Township Fire Company for
minimum fire fighting purposes, fire hydrants shall be installed
at appropriate locations. In residential developments, a water
supply system and fire hydrants shall be installed in
accordance with the New Jersey Residential Site Improvement
Standards (Subchapter 5). In other than residential
developments, a water supply system and fire hydrants shall be
installed as recommended by the Township Fire Marshal and
Fire Chief and accepted by the Raritan Township Governing
Body. The public water supply system in nonresidential
§ 16.18.100 CODE ADOPTION § 16.18.100
1.01:483
developments shall be capable of supplying the needed fire
flow at all times for a minimum duration of one hour for flows
of 1,500 gpm or less at a minimum of 20 psi residual pressure
or for two hours for flows greater than 1,500 gpm at a
minimum of 20 psi residual pressure. Hydrants shall be spaced
to provide the necessary fire flow as indicated in Attachment
"A" entitled Fire Flow Requirements for the Township of
Raritan, attached to the ordinance codified in this section and
on file for public inspection. The allowance for each fire
hydrant at 20 psi residual pressure used to deliver the fire
flows listed in the above table is as follows:
Allow up to 1,000 gpm for each hydrant within 300 feet of the
building;
Allow up to 670 gpm for each hydrant within 301 to 600 of the
building;
Allow up to 250 gpm for each hydrant within 601 to 1,000 of
the building;
Allow zero gpm for each hydrant greater than 1,000 feet from
the building.
Hydrants shall be installed in accordance with standards set
forth in ANSI/AWWA, Dry Barrel Fire Hydrants, latest edition;
painted as directed by the Township Fire Marshal and Fire
Chief; and tested in accordance with NFPA 291, Recommended
Practice for Fire Flow Testing and Marking of Hydrants, latest
edition, to ensure compliance with fire flow requirements.
Acceptance test data shall be provided to the Township Fire
Marshal and Fire Chief for review and approval. In areas
where public water supply is available, but such water supply
does not have the capacity to satisfy the foregoing minimum
standards, such public water supply system shall be
supplemented with additional measures to satisfy the minimum
fire protection requirements of the Township. Such additional
measures may involve any one or a combination of the
following: installation of booster pumps with appurtenances,
installation of water storage tanks with appurtenances,
creation of drafting points with appurtenances, or such other
means of increasing fire fighting capability as may be
recommended and approved by the Township Fire Marshal and
Fire Chief.
b. Where public water supply is not available, underground water
storage tanks shall be installed to provide a source of water for
fire fighting. For subdivisions in residential zoning districts,
underground water storage tanks shall be located and installed
so that no dwelling is farther than 1,000 linear feet from any
such tank as measured along the street, either public or
§ 16.18.100 RARITAN CODE § 16.18.100
1.01:484
§ 16.18.110. Design Standards.
private, and the access driveway to the dwelling. In no event
shall the distance between tanks be greater than 2,000 linear
feet. At least one tank shall be installed for each 2,000 linear
feet of street length or fraction thereof. The minimum capacity
of every underground water storage tank within residential
zoning districts shall be 15,000 usable gallons.
The locations of all fire protection systems and appurtenances
shall be approved by the Township Fire Marshal or Fire Chief.
Unless an equivalent alternate fire protection system is
authorized by the Planning Board and the Township Fire
Company, underground water storage tank systems shall be
provided and shall be constructed and installed in accordance
with design standards and specifications on file in the
Township Engineering Department.
In all cases where a fire protection system is required, no
construction permit shall be issued for a dwelling or principal
structure upon any lot within the subdivision until, to the
extent necessary to afford fire protection to such dwelling or
principal structure, such system is installed and its operability
tested and approved by the Township Fire Marshal and Fire
Chief.
11. Street Lighting. Street lights shall be required at every street
intersection and on the end of each cul-de-sac. In addition, street
lights may be required in other locations as determined by the
Planning Board. If the street has a sidewalk along one side, the
street lights will generally be limited to the sidewalk side of the
street.
A. General. The subdivider shall observe the following requirements and
principles of land subdivision in the design of each subdivision or
portion thereof. To assist developers in good design techniques, several
sketches illustrating design standards are attached to and made a part
of this Title by reference. Such sketches shall be on file in the office of
the Planning Board.
1. Development Patterns. The subdivision plat shall conform to design
standards of this ordinance and should reflect the desire for a more
natural layout respecting existing natural features. [Amended by
Ord. 06-11]
2. Reservation of Public Areas. If the master plan or the official map
provides for the reservation of designated streets, public
drainageways, flood control basins, bikeways, walkways or public
areas within the proposed development, before approving a
subdivision, the Planning Board may further require that such
streets, ways, basins or areas be shown on the plat in locations and
§ 16.18.100 CODE ADOPTION § 16.18.110
1.01:485
sizes suitable to their intended uses. The Planning Board may
reserve the location and extent of such streets, ways, basins or
areas shown on the plat for a period of one year after the approval
of the final plat or within such further time as may be agreed to
by the developer. Unless during such period or extension thereof
the Township shall have entered into a contract to purchase or
institute condemnation proceedings according to law for the fee or
a lesser interest in the land comprising such streets, ways, basins
or areas, the developer shall not be bound by such reservations
shown on the plat and may proceed to use such land for private
use in accordance with applicable development regulations. The
provisions of this section shall not apply to the streets and roads,
flood control basins or public drainageways necessitated by the
subdivision or land development and required for final approval.
The developer shall be entitled to just compensation for actual loss
found to be caused by such temporary reservation and deprivation
of use. In such instance, unless a lesser amount has previously
been mutually agreed upon, just compensation shall be deemed
to be the fair market value of an option to purchase the land
reserved for the period of reservation; provided that determination
of such fair market value shall include, but not be limited to,
consideration of the real property taxes apportioned to the land
reserved and prorated for the period of reservation. The developer

which do not conform to pavement and/or right-of-way widths as shown
on the master plan or official map, shall dedicate and improve to
Township specifications the additional width from the centerline of the
road abutting the property being subdivided. If the subdivision adjoins
one side of an existing road which does not meet standards, only onehalf
of the required extra width shall be dedicated and improved to
Township specifications.
When in the interests of traffic safety, health, convenience and good
planning a postponement of the installation of construction of a
widened roadway is desirable, the Planning Board may authorize such
postponement providing the developer shall deposit with the Township
the cost of the improvement in lieu of actually constructing or installing
same in the same manner as required in Section 16.16.010.
D. Street Design Standards.

4. Setbacks. Where land has been dedicated for a widening of existing
streets, lots shall begin at such new street line as may have been
established, and all setbacks shall be measured from such line.
5. Substandard Suitability. Where there is a question of the suitability
of a lot or lots for their intended use due to factors such as rock
formations, flood conditions, high water table, sewage disposal,
excessive topographic slope or similar circumstances, the Planning
Board may, after adequate investigation, with professional
assistance, if deemed necessary, withhold approval of such lots.
6. Driveways. Driveways shall not be located where visibility is
impaired because of curves or topography. They shall be
constructed in accordance with Chapter 12.20.

A. The standards set forth in this chapter shall be considered the minimum
requirements for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare
of the citizens of the Township. If, however, the applicant can clearly
demonstrate that, because of peculiar conditions pertaining to his or
her land, the literal enforcement of this chapter is impracticable or will
exact undue hardship, the Planning Board may permit such waivers as
may be reasonable and are within the general purpose and intent of the
rules, regulations and standards established by this chapter.
B. Checklist Waivers. If it can be demonstrated that, because of peculiar
conditions relating to the property or proposed construction, any of the
required plat details are not necessary to properly evaluate the plan,
the Planning Board may waive specific requirements. A written request
and explanation for the waiver request must accompany the application
submission.
C. Reservations of Public Areas.

before approving a site plan, may further require that such streets,
ways, basins or areas be shown on the plan in locations and sizes
suitable to their intended uses. The Planning Board may reserve
the location and extent of such streets, ways, basins or areas shown
on the plan for a period of one year after the approval of the final
plan or within such further time as may be agreed to by the
developer. Unless during such period or extension thereof the
Township shall have entered into a contract to purchase or institute
condemnation proceedings according to law for the fee or a lesser
interest in the land comprising such streets, ways, basins or areas,
the developer shall not be bound by such reservations shown on the
plan and may proceed to use such land for private use in
accordance with applicable development regulations.
2. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to the streets and
roads, flood control basins or public drainageways necessitated by
the land development and required for final approval.
3. The developer shall be entitled to just compensation for actual loss
found to be caused by such temporary reservation and deprivation
of use. In such instance, unless a lesser amount has previously been
mutually agreed upon, just compensation shall be deemed to be the
fair market value of an option to purchase the land reserved for the
period of reservation, provided that determination of such fair
market value shall include, but not be limited to, consideration of

throughout a particular project. The design theme would include
style of lettering, construction, material, type of pole or standard
(wood or metal, for example), size and lighting. Color of letters and
background is also important and should be carefully considered in
relation to the color of the material of buildings or where the signs
are proposed to be located.
2. Location. For safety, signs should be located so as not to create a
hazard, particularly at driveway and street intersections. The
location of signs should be selected in terms of visibility. Signs
designed to be seen from vehicles should be perpendicular to the
line of travel, while signs designed to be read on foot can be
perpendicular or parallel with walks.
I. Utilities. Storm drainage, sanitary waste disposal, water supply and
other required utilities shall be reviewed and considered. Particular
emphasis shall be given to the protection of delineated floodplains,
reservations of stream corridors, establishment of drainage rights-ofway,
the adequacy of existing systems and the need for improvements,
both on-site and off-site, to control the rate, volume and velocity of
storm drainage, to provide for treatment of effluent and to maintain an
adequate supply of potable water at sufficient pressure.
J. Solid Waste Facilities. Garbage disposal provisions shall be reviewed
for adequacy of storage facilities, vermin and rodent control, location,

M. Energy Conservation. The site plan should be designed to take
advantage of features of the site which will reduce energy usage in the
structures placed on the site, as well as utilizing features to ameliorate
undesirable microclimates on the site itself. Features of interest include
slope, exposure, wind, humidity, glare, canopy cover and the placement
of objects and plantings to take advantage of or ameliorate site
conditions.
N. Engineering Design Considerations. The site plan shall be designed in
accordance with accepted engineering design practice to produce a

implement the performance standards established in Section
16.20.030. The performance standards provide a general frame of
reference for the applicant in preparing his or her site plan and also
provide guidance for the Township in reviewing the proposed
development. The Planning Board must find that these standards
have been met before an application is approved. These design
standards are intended to implement the performance standards.
The applicant may propose and utilize an alternative design
standard if it can be demonstrated to the Planning Board that it will
satisfactorily implement the applicable performance standard.
2. The Municipal Planner and Township Engineer will be available by
appointment to discuss the design standards contained herein with
respect to any site plan application. In addition, they are available
to meet for presubmission conference with all applicants.

b. Between buildings of different types:
i. Where buildings of different types will be developed as a
single development group, such as single-family and
townhouses, an appropriate buffer shall be used. This may
include fencing, facing similar uses toward each other,
natural areas, parks or recreation facilities or uses
providing gradual density changes between the two
dissimilar uses.
ii. Actual building spacing between the two types of uses
should be equal to the height of the lower density use
times the difference in the net density of the two uses.
Where a development abuts existing single-family
detached housing, the requirements for buffers as set
forth in the zoning ordinance shall be applied.
2. Townhouses:
a. Maximum of eight units in a single row: minimum width of unit:
18 feet; offset of a minimum of four feet between every two
units.

direct cars in the property direction. Provisions shall be made
for vehicles to circulate through a filled lot without having to
enter again from the street.
g. All parking spaces shall have clear sight distance for backing
out of the space.
h. Large parking areas should have raised sidewalks or planting
beds between bays at appropriate intervals. The walks or bed
should allow for car overhang and shall be a minimum of 10
feet in width.
i. Parking lots and access drives are to be set back at least 25
feet from residential zones, at least 20 feet from street right-ofway
lines, and at least 15 feet from all other property lines to
provide for adequate room for earth berms and screening and
buffering of the parking lot. The provisions of Section
16.70.020E.3. shall be observed.
j. When guardrails are required, they shall be constructed of
wood rails supported by wooden or Corten steel posts, as
approved by the Township Engineer, utilizing the detail
approved for use on the Garden State Parkway.
k. Off-Street Parking Requirements for a Combination of Uses.
The parking requirement for each use shall be computed
separately and then added together to compute the total
number of required parking areas. In all questionable or
§ 16.20.040 RARITAN CODE § 16.20.040
1.01:516
doubtful cases, or for uses not enumerated, the Planning Board
shall determine the required number of spaces, utilizing as a
standard the requirements for the uses which are specifically
enumerated.
3. Parking Area Design Standards.
a. Access. There shall be adequate provisions for ingress and
egress to all parking spaces. The width of access drives or
driveways shall be determined as part of site plan review
depending on use, topography and similar consideration and as
determined by Chapter 16.70.
b. Size of Aisles. The width of all aisles providing direct access to
individual parking stalls shall be in accordance with the
requirements set forth below. Only one-way traffic shall be
permitted in aisles serving single-row parking spaces placed at

c. General Location. No off-street loading area shall be located in
a minimum required front yard. All parking shall be located in
bays generally perpendicular to driveways or roads. Paving
should not abut a building unless necessary for loading or for
pedestrian circulation.
d. Location in Different Zones. No access drive, driveway or other
means of ingress and egress shall be located in any residential
zone to provide access to uses other than those permitted to
such residential zone.
e. Sidewalk and Curbing. Sidewalks between parking areas and
principal structures, along aisles and driveways, at the head of
parking stalls and wherever pedestrian traffic shall occur, shall
be provided with a minimum width of four feet of clear
passable area and shall be raised six inches or more above the
parking area, except when crossing streets or driveways for
barrier-free access. Guardrails and wheel stops permanently
anchored to the ground shall be provided in appropriate
locations. Parked vehicles shall not overhang or extend over
§ 16.20.040 CODE ADOPTION § 16.20.040
1.01:517
sidewalk areas, unless an additional sidewalk width of three
feet is provided to accommodate such overhang.
f. Traffic and Pedestrian Island. Heavily utilized parking lots shall
have dividing islands as required by the Planning Board
between bays at appropriate intervals to provide pedestrian
safety and to confine vehicles to marked travel aisles within the
parking lot. Islands shall be at least 10 wide and shall be
landscaped with shade and ornamental trees or pedestrian
walks as required.
g. Landscaping and Drainage.
i. Parking areas shall be suitably landscaped to minimize
noise, glare and other nuisance characteristics as well as
to enhance the environment and ecology of the
surrounding area. Large parking lots shall be broken down
into separate lots of not more than 300 cars and separated
from other sections by landscaping, and similar elements.
Said parking areas shall have suitable drainage facilities
as required by the Township Engineer and shall conform to
the requirements of Subsection C.3.e. and C.3.f.
ii. Off-tract drainage facilities and structures requiring
enlargement, modification or reconstruction resulting in
part from, or totally as the result of, the proposed
development shall be subject to off-tract improvement
requirements and standards as established by the
Township.
h. Lighting. Lighting standards for parking areas shall follow the
requirements of Section 16.20.040.G. [Amended by Ord.
02-21]
i. Markings and Access. Parking stalls, driveways and aisles shall
be clearly marked and delineated. The Planning Board may
require that certain areas be maintained for fire fighting or
other emergency purposes, and these areas shall be
appropriately designated.
4. Circulation Systems for High-Density Residential Developments.
High-density residential developments should be serviced by a
complete loop street system of at least 30 feet in width affording at
least two means of ingress/egress to the site. Crossovers between
the legs of the loop should be provided. When a complete loop
system is not practical, a thirty-four to forty-foot wide street with a
divided roadway as the entrance should be provided or some other
means of ensuring access for emergency vehicles.
5. General Circulation and Parking Design Principles.
§ 16.20.040 RARITAN CODE § 16.20.040
1.01:518
a. Parking space allocations should be oriented to specified
buildings.
b. Parking areas would be designed to focus on major walkways.
c. Where pedestrians must cross service roads or access roads to
reach parking areas, crosswalks should be clearly designated
by pavement markings or signs, or by placing of different
pavement materials. Crosswalk surfaces should be raised
slightly to indicate them to drivers, unless drainage problems
would result. A one-way car movement (to the left or
counterclockwise) should be encouraged. A major loop should
be developed around the parking areas and parking bays
should run perpendicular off the road.
d. Driveways should approach from the right to permit
passengers to alight to or from the sidewalk.
e. Whenever possible, one-way traffic should be established at
building entrances.
f. Where buses are a factor, bus shelters and bus indentation
slots off the roadway should be provided.
g. Roads and driveways from main roads should be located at
grade and not below the crest of vertical curves.
h. Parking spaces should be kept at least 50 feet from the
intersection of the ingress access with the street.
i. An indented area for last car maneuvering shall be provided.
j. Ingress and egress for the site should be minimized and
provided with acceleration/deceleration lanes with large curb
radii to permit ease of access to the parking lot or main road
without backing up traffic.
k. Design of islands should consider snow removal operations and
not create an undue hindrance for this operation.
l. All sidewalk intersections should be flared beginning 24 inches
before the intersection on all legs of the intersection.
6. Off-Street Loading Requirements.
a. In any zone, in connection with every building or buildings,
group or part thereof, hereafter erected which is to be
occupied by industrial, office, laboratory, commercial or
distribution uses, there shall be provided and maintained, on
the same lot with such building, off-street loading berths in
accordance with the requirements set forth below.
b. Each loading space shall be no less than 12 feet in width, 50
feet in length and 14 feet in height, and may not occupy any

7. Joint Facilities for Off-Street Parking or Loading. Off-street parking
and loading facilities for separate uses may be provided jointly if
the total number of spaces so provided is not less than the sum of
the separate requirements for each use; provided, however, that if
the time of use of such spaces by a participating use does not
overlap with the time of use by any other participating use, the
number of spaces may be reduced to the number required for the
most intensive use or uses.
8. Maintenance of Off-Street Parking and Loading Area. Every parcel
of land hereafter used as a public or private off-street parking or
loading area shall be maintained in good condition, free of hazards
and deterioration. All pavement areas, sidewalks, curbs, drainage
facilities, lighting, bumpers, guardrails, markings, signs,
§ 16.20.040 RARITAN CODE § 16.20.040
1.01:520
landscaping and other improvements shall be maintained in
workable, safe and good condition.
9. Waiver of Parking and Off-Street Loading and Unloading
Requirements. If any applicant can clearly demonstrate to the
Planning Board that, because of the nature of his or her operation
or use, the parking and/or loading and unloading requirements of
this section are unnecessary or excessive, the Planning Board shall
have the power to approve a site plan showing less paved parking
or unloading area than is required by this chapter; provided,
however, that a landscaped area of sufficient size to meet the
deficiency shall be set aside and reserved for the purpose of
meeting future off-street parking or unloading requirements in the
event that a change of use of the premises shall make such
additional off-street facilities necessary.
10. Location of Driveways.
a. All entrance and exit driveways shall be located to afford
maximum safety to traffic, to provide for safe and convenient
ingress and egress to and from the site, and to minimize
conflict with the flow of traffic.
b. Any exit driveway or driveway lane shall be so designed in
profile and grading, and located to provide the following
minimum sight distance measured in each direction. The
measurements shall be from the driver's seat of a vehicle
standing on that portion of the exit driveway with the front of
the vehicle a minimum of 10 feet behind the curbline or edge of
the shoulder with the height of the eye 3.75 feet to the top of
an object 4.5 feet above the pavement.

50 740 700
c. Where a site occupies a corner of two intersecting roads, no
driveway entrance or exit shall be located within 50 feet of the
point of tangency of the existing or proposed curb radius of
that site or from the right-of-way line of the intersecting street,
whichever is greater.
§ 16.20.040 CODE ADOPTION § 16.20.040
1.01:521
d. No part of any driveway shall be located within a minimum of
15 feet of a side property line. However, the Planning Board
may permit a driveway serving two or more adjacent sites to be
located on or within 10 feet of a side property line between the
adjacent site.
e. No entrance or exit driveway shall be located on a rotary ramp
of an interchange or within 100 feet of the beginning of any
ramp or other portion of an interchange or jughandle.
f. Where two or more two-way driveways connect a single site to
any one road, a minimum clear distance of 100 feet measured
along the right-of-way line shall separate the closest edges of
any two such driveways. If one driveway is two-way and one is
one-way driveway, the minimum distance shall be 70 feet.
g. Driveways for uses on adjacent lots shall be no closer than 40
feet at the closest edges of the driveway as measured at the
right-of-way line.
11. Driveway Angle.
a. Two-Way Operation. Driveways used for two-way operation
shall intersect the road at an angle to as near 90° as site
conditions will permit and in no case will be less than 60°.
b. One-Way Operation. Driveways used by vehicles in one
direction of travel (right-turn only) shall not form an angle
smaller than 45° with a road, unless acceleration and
deceleration lanes are provided.
12. Driveway Dimensions. The dimensions of driveways shall be
designed to accommodate adequately the volume and character of
vehicles anticipated to be attracted daily onto the land
development for which a site plan is prepared. The required
maximum and minimum dimension for driveways are indicated
below. Driveways serving large volumes of daily traffic or traffic of
over 15% truck traffic shall be required to utilize high to maximum
dimensions.

1.01:522
* NOTE: All driveways shall be six feet wider at the curb line,
and this additional width shall be maintained for a distance
of 20 feet into the site. Driveway curb radii shall be designed
to permit vehicles using the site to turn into or out without
encroaching on an adjacent land of either the driveway or
the intersecting road. Channelization islands should be greater
than 50 square feet in area and curbed. Smaller islands should
be painted.
13. Driveway Surfacing. The surface of any driveway shall be
constructed with a permanent pavement of a type specified and
approved by the Township Engineer and shall normally be four
inches bituminous stabilized base topped with two inches FABC
surface. Such pavement shall extend to the paved portion of the
road and shall extend throughout the area defined by the required
driveway dimensions specified above.
14. Driveway Profile. Any vertical curve on a driveway shall be flat
enough to prevent the dragging of any vehicle undercarriage.
Should the sidewalk be so close to the curb at a depressed curb
driveway as to cause the ramp to be too steep and be likely to cause
undercarriage drag, the sidewalk shall be appropriately lowered to
provide a suitable ramp gradient.
15. Driveway Grades. Driveways shall not have a grade in excess of
10% over the entire length. The first 25 feet of driveway should
grade toward the intersecting road and not exceed 6% unless
otherwise approved by the Planning Board. Driveways shall not be
located where visibility is limited because of curves or topography.
The maximum difference between grades should not exceed 8%.
16. Acceleration Lanes. Where a driveway serves right-turning traffic
from a parking area providing 200 or more parking spaces and the
road has peak hour traffic volume exceeding 750 vehicles per hour,
an acceleration lane shall be provided which is at least 250 feet
long and at least 10 feet wide measured form the road curb line. A
minimum thirty-five-foot curb return radius shall be used from the
driveway to the acceleration lane.
17. Deceleration Lanes.
a. Where a driveway serves an entrance to land development
providing 100 or more parking spaces, a deceleration lane
shall be provided for traffic turning right into the driveway
from the road. The deceleration lane shall be at least 200 feet
long and at least 10 feet wide measured from the road curb
line. A minimum thirty-five-foot curb return radius shall be
used from the deceleration lane into the driveway.
b. In instances where there is insufficient frontage to
accommodate the required length of acceleration or
§ 16.20.040 CODE ADOPTION § 16.20.040
1.01:523
deceleration lane, a separate right turn ramp 18 feet in width
having a turning radius of 75 feet is to be provided. If an island
is provided, the throat width is to be 23 feet onto or out of the
site.
18. Reverse-Frontage Roads. Reverse-frontage or parallel access roads
shall be required by the Planning Board upon analysis and
recommendation of the Township Engineer where the volume of
traffic or configuration of the road and adjoining intersections
requires same for safety and to keep traffic easily flowing.
D. Landscaping.
1. A detailed landscaping plan shall be submitted with each final site
plan application. The plan shall identify existing and proposed
trees, shrubs, bushes, plant material and ground cover, and natural
features such as boulders and rock outcroppings/. It should show
where they are or will be located, and the planting details and
specifications.
2. Landscaping shall be specific as to the location, size, spacing,
quantity and species (botanical and common name) of all plants, as
well as the location, perimeter outline, type and thickness of all
mulches. Size, quantity, species and other pertinent information
shall also be listed in the form of a schedule on the landscaping
plan. Where turf is anticipated, topsoiling, seeding or sodding,
fertilizing, liming and water specifications shall be provided.
Planting details (staking, fertilizing, watering, soil mixture, etc.)
specific to soil conditions and the exposure of the site shall also be
provided.
3. The landscaping plan shall include the following information
regarding existing trees and vegetation: [Amended by Ord.
10-27]
a. The location of the tree canopy within the property boundaries.
Identify any areas of clear cutting which have occurred on the
property within the last five years. [Amended by Ord. 11-3]
b. Trees that qualify as specimen and historic trees.
c. Clear labeling of individual trees to be preserved within the
area of development/limit of disturbance with their drip lines
noted.
d. Clear labeling of the trees intended for removal and the
location of replacement trees in compliance with Section
16.20.040.S.
e. The location of existing and proposed buildings/structures,
driveways and parking areas.
§ 16.20.040 RARITAN CODE § 16.20.040
1.01:524
f. The plan shall provide a schedule of the size and species of
individual trees with a DBH of 10 inches or greater excluding
those within steep slopes (over 25%), wetlands, floodplains,
and riparian or associated buffers.
g. Proposed methods to protect the existing trees and growth
during and after construction in compliance with Section
16.20.040.N.2.
4. The following principles should be followed:
a. Locate landscaping to provide for climate control. For example,
shade trees on the south to shield the hot summer sun, and
evergreens on the north and northwest for windbreaks;
b. Use landscaping to accept and complement buildings. For
example, groupings of tall trees to break up long, low buildings
and lower plantings for taller buildings;
c. Landscaping should be provided in public areas, recreation
sites and adjacent to buildings;
d. Vines and climbing plants should be considered for large
expanses of walls for reducing heat build-up and aesthetics;
e. Consider massing trees as critical points rather than in a
straight line at predetermined intervals along streets. Vary
types by neighborhood. At least two types of trees should be
used for environmental diversity;
f. Groundcover may be used extensively to reduce erosion and is
encouraged on slopes;
g. Provide for a variety and mixture of landscaping. The variety
should consider susceptibility to disease, colors, season,
texture, shapes, blossoms and foliage;
h. Local soil conditions and water availability should be
considered in the choice of landscaping;
i. Consider the impact of any proposed landscaping plan at
various time intervals. Shrubs may grow and eventually block
sight distances. Foundation plants may block outbuildings;
j. It is preferable to have fewer large specimens than more
smaller ones;
k. Deciduous trees should be at least 1 3/4 inch to two inch
caliper at planting, and evergreens should be at least four feet
tall. Shrubs should be at least 18 to 24 inches tall at planting.
All plantings should be balled and burlapped unless otherwise
approved by the Planning Board;
§ 16.20.040 CODE ADOPTION § 16.20.040
1.01:525
l. Street trees should be selected to fit the space provided, wide
spreading trees planted where there is room, and small or
narrow trees in restricted areas;
m. Entrance to sites deserve special landscaping treatment;
n. Existing large trees should be saved by not varying the grade
around the trees by more than six inches to 12 inches, by
construction of tree wells and walls, and by erecting protective
fences during construction activities. Maximum effort should
be made to save groups of trees rather than individual ones;
o. Off-street parking lots designed to accommodate more than 25
vehicles shall be landscaped so that landscaping equal to at
least 15% of the parking area is provided in the manner
specified below.
The parking area is that area devoted to parking spaces, aisles
and space back up area and shall generally consist of such
areas within curbing but excluding building, access aisles
leading from a street to the parking area, pedestrian walkways
and landscaped areas.
In calculating the landscaped area, the following may be
included:
i. Landscaping within the parking area consisting of
landscaped islands between rows of parking spaces and
islands at the end of parking rows,
ii. Landscaped areas which may extend into the parking area
from the perimeter of the paved area even though such
may be outside of the parking lot curbed area; and
landscaped areas where parking lot curbed areas as
extended would intersect. Examples of such are attached.
Proposed use of landscaped areas other than those
illustrated may also be used as part of the required
landscaping if approved by the Planning Board.
In determining whether to include such other areas as
part of the required parking lot landscaping, the Planning
Board shall find that such area is so located and
landscaped as to contribute to the objective that parking
areas be landscaped,
iii. Up to, but not to exceed, one-third of the required 15% of
landscaping in the parking area may be included in a
landscaped area along a street right of way line located
between the street right of way and parking spaces when
such parking spaces are proposed in the front and/or side
yard abutting a street are located between a building and
street right of way. Such area may include any such
§ 16.20.040 RARITAN CODE § 16.20.040
1.01:526
bufferyard required between the street right of way and
parking spaces when such parking spaces are proposed in
the front and/or side yard abutting a street and located
between a building and street right of way (see Section
16.20.040.E). In no case shall landscaping along the
building face and/or foundation be included as part of
the required landscaping within a parking area. Building
facade or building foundation landscaping between a
building and a sidewalk generally paralleling such
building, or if no sidewalk generally parallels such
building, shall be landscaping between 15 feet of the
building facade and/or foundation. [Amended by Ord.
02-36]
iv. To be included as part of the required parking lot
landscaping such areas shall include trees and/or shrubs
as well as appropriate surface treatment,
v. At least one landscaping island containing a canopy tree
shall be planted every eight spaces within the parking lot.
Should the Board determine that the use precludes the
planting on trees within the parking area then the
developer shall be required to provide twice the number of
trees that would have been required in the parking area
elsewhere on site if possible, or off site in a separate
location to be approved by the Board if sufficient area on
site is not available. [Amended by Ord. 06-11]
p. It is the intent to have parking lots canopied with trees to
reduce stormwater runoff. Light standards should also be
located in these islands or walkways;
q. Parking lot landscaping should be designed and located to
withstand the effects of snowplowing;
r. All landscaping in parking areas should be carefully located so
as not to obstruct vision. A variety of different types of trees
should be grouped to break up the mass of cars;
s. Plantings should be chosen to match the particular
microclimate and space restrictions to which they will be
exposed. For example, drought-tolerant plants should be
located where a plant will be surrounded by pavement, and
maples and other trees would not be located where their roots
can raise sidewalks;
t. Select trees that can withstand an urban environment in
parking lot locations;
u. All parking areas shall be screened from the street and
adjoining or adjacent properties. Screening shall include
§ 16.20.040 CODE ADOPTION § 16.20.040
1.01:527
planting, dropped or depressed parking lots, earth berms,
masonry walls or fences, or a combination of these elements;
v. Landscaping designed as buffers or screening on combination
with other screening devices should be a minimum of three
feet high at the time of planting and should consist of a
majority of evergreen plant materials. Screening shall be
carefully placed so as not to impair visibility or vehicles
entering or exiting parking areas;
w. Shade trees shall be located along all streets and drives but
outside all public road rights-of-way where possible. Applicants
should follow the shade tree planting plan requirements as
outlined in Section 16.20.040.D.4.
x. The provisions of Section 16.20.040.E. Buffers, Fences and
Bufferyards and of Chapter 16.74 the performance standards
of the zoning ordinance shall be observed. [Amended by Ord.
02-36]
y. Where existing trees are to be preserved, the grade of the land
located within the dripline shall not be raised or lowered by
more than six inches unless compensated by construction of
tree wells or retaining walls; and in no event shall tree wells or
retaining walls be less than six feet from the trunk of a tree.
[Amended by Ord. 10-27]
E. Buffers, Fences and Bufferyards.
1. Any new non-residential use or high intensity residential use (see
footnotes of Tables I and II of this section), or change in a nonresidential
use to a more intensive class of use, or expansion of an
existing non-residential or high intensity residential use by at least
25% of the floor area and/or impervious surface associated with the
use that is proposed, on a lot adjoining a lot containing a less
intensive class of existing use or a vacant lot zoned for less
intensive uses shall provide a transitional bufferyard and screening
meeting the requirements of this section. In the case of an
expansion of an existing use, where the degree of expansion does
not exceed 50%, such expansion need only provide a transitional
bufferyard and screening that meets the requirements of this
section to a degree proportional to the degree of expansion. For
example, a 30% expansion of an existing use shall provide a
transitional bufferyard meeting 30% of required bufferyard depth
and plant density requirements. These transitional bufferyard
regulations apply whether or not the adjoining lot is in the same
zoning district. [Amended by Ord. 02-36]
2. Location of Transitional Bufferyard and Screens. Transitional
bufferyards and screens shall be located:
§ 16.20.040 RARITAN CODE § 16.20.040
1.01:528
a. Along the perimeter of a lot or parcel, but not within any
portion of an existing or proposed road right of a way; or
b. In instances where the area represented by a site plan is
significantly less than the total area of the lot(s) of record, the
Board may permit the screening required between the
proposed use and the adjacent lot(s) to be located in a
transitional bufferyard surrounding the smaller area provided
that;
i. The depth of the transitional bufferyard and type of
screening provided for the smaller area is equal to or
greater than required by Table I and II of this section; and
ii. The transitional bufferyards required in Table I of this
section are also provided around the perimeter of the
lots(s) of record; and
iii. The total area of the lot(s) of record, less the smaller area
represented by the subject site plan, could meet the
minimum requirements within the applicable zoning
district, if considered as if they were independent lot(s) of
record. [Amended by Ord. 02-36]
3. Depth of Transitional Bufferyards.
a. Required Bufferyard Depth. Transitional bufferyard depth
requirements are set forth in Table I of this section. To
determine the required bufferyard depth, first identify the
class of the proposed new, changed, or expanded use. Then
identify the class of each adjoining existing use and the zoning
of each adjoining vacant lot. Then use the matrix in Table I to
identify the required bufferyard depth (shown at the
intersection of the row associated with the proposed use and
the column associated with the adjoining use or vacant lot
zoning).
b. Overlap with Other Yards. In the event that a transitional
bufferyard depth requirement conflicts with yard requirements
within an applicable zoning district, the more stringent shall
apply. [Amended by Ord. 02-36]
4. Screening Required within Transitional Bufferyards.
a. Required Screening. Minimum screening requirements are set
forth in Table II of this section. To determine the required
screening type, first identify the class of the proposed new,
changed, or expanded use. Then identify the class of each
adjoining existing use and the zoning of each adjoining vacant
lot. Then use the matrix in Table II to identify the required
screening type (shown at the intersection of the row associated
with the proposed use and the column associated with the
§ 16.20.040 CODE ADOPTION § 16.20.040
1.01:529
adjoining use or vacant lot zoning). Required screening may be
composed of existing vegetation, planted vegetation, a fence, a
wall, a landscaped earthen berm, or any combination of these
screening measures. Examples and plantings guidelines are on
file with the Planning Board in the Planning and Zoning Office
and are referenced as "Bufferyard Planting Guidelines".
b. Types of Screens.
i. Type A Opaque Screen: A screen that is opaque year-round
from the ground to a height of at least 10 feet, with
intermittent visual obstructions from the opaque portion to
a height of at least 20 feet. The opaque screen is intended
to exclude all visual contact between uses and to create a
strong impression of spatial separation. A Type A screen
may be composed of fencing, walls, berms, landscaping or
any combination thereof as may be appropriate to the
specific site and use in question.
ii. Type B Broken Screen: The broken screen is intended to
create the impression of spatial separation between uses
without necessarily eliminating visual contact between the
spaces.
A screen composed of either:
One canopy tree per 30 lineal feet of bufferyard;
One under-story tree per 20 lineal feet of bufferyard;
One shrub per five lineal feet of bufferyard;
Any combination of the above; or
Any other screening that meets or exceeds the degree of
screening achieved by the above.
5. Alternative Transitional Bufferyards and Screening. Recognizing
that a transitional bufferyard is defined by both its depth and the
density of screening within it, the Board may allow a transitional
bufferyard's depth to be reduced by up to 50% from that specified
in Table I if the density of screening within the bufferyard is
increased to an equivalent degree - provided the bufferyard
remains deep enough to accommodate the healthy growth and
protection of the proposed screen plantings. Similarly, the Board
may also allow a transitional bufferyard's screening density to be
reduced by up to 50% from that specified in Table II if the
bufferyards depth is increased to an equivalent degree.
6. Additional Transitional Bufferyards and Screening Required.
a. In addition to any screening requirements found elsewhere in
this Title, any outside storage of junk, refuse, salvage, or
discarded materials shall be screened from adjacent rights-ofway
by means of Type A screening.
§ 16.20.040 RARITAN CODE § 16.20.040
1.01:530
b. Whenever a use is proposed along a collector street, county or
state road, a 10 feet deep transitional bufferyard and Type B
screening shall be required adjacent to the right of way.
[Amended by Ord. 02-54]
c. Whenever a non-residential use is proposed next to a
residential use and is separated from the residential use by a
public road, a 10 feet deep transitional bufferyard and Type B
screening shall be provided adjacent to the public right of way.
7. Uses and Structures Permitted within the Transitional Bufferyards.
a. A transitional bufferyard may contain utility lines, driveways,
or pedestrian or bicycle paths, provided that:
i. The proposed locations of such uses are necessary for
their proper functioning, and such uses cross the
bufferyard where feasible, rather than lie along the length
of the bufferyard; and
ii. The total width of the bufferyard is maintained; and
iii. No screen required by this ordinance is reduced or
eliminated.
b. Signs shall be permitted within transitional bufferyards
provided that:
i. They are completely screened from view from any point on
adjacent residential properties; and
ii. Placement of such signs shall not violate other provisions
of this Code.
c. Transitional bufferyards shall not be used for parking, loading,
storage, or any activity that is either part of or accessory to the
proposed use.
d. A transitional bufferyard may contain all or part of a storm
water management system provided that:
i. Said system meets requirements found in Section
16.20.040 of this chapter;
ii. No screen required by this section is reduced or
eliminated;
iii. Any detention basin shall be sufficiently landscaped and
graded so as to be aesthetically pleasing;
iv. The geometric or other man-made appearance of such
facilities shall be discouraged.
8. Requirements for Plants Used for Screening.
§ 16.20.040 CODE ADOPTION § 16.20.040
1.01:531
a. Use of Existing Vegetation Encouraged. Existing vegetation
that meets or exceeds applicable screening requirements may
be used to satisfy the requirements of this section, provided
the transitional bufferyard contains sufficient area surrounding
the vegetation to ensure its protection from encroachments
that may threaten its continued healthy growth.
b. Location and Spacing. Plants shall be staggered or clustered as
necessary to maximize screening objectives and to meet the
needs of the particular species of plants for root space, water,
light and circulation.
c. Minimum Height at Planting. Plantings shall follow minimum
planting guidelines as found in referenced document entitled
"Bufferyard Planting Guidelines" on file with the Planning
Board and available for review at the Planning and Zoning
office.
d. Minimum Height at Maturity.
i. Canopy trees, understory trees, and hedge plants shall be
of a variety that has a minimum mature height which will
meet the minimum screening requirements for which they
were chosen.
ii. Shrubs shall be of a variety that has an average mature
height of at least three feet.
9. Requirements for Fences, Walls and Berms Used for Screening.
a. Fences and Walls. Fences and walls shall be screened over at
least 50% of their exterior face area by plantings which provide
year-round screening to obstruct the view of the fence or wall
from adjacent properties. This may be achieved with a tight
evergreen hedge that is 1/2 the height of the fence or wall; or
by using plants other than the evergreen hedge meeting the
above requirement, provided that figures on the average
mature height and spread of each species to be planted are
submitted with the site plan for approval by the Board.
b. Berms. Berms shall be planted with trees, shrubs, vines,
grasses, or other groundcover. Part of a berm may be devoted
to a non-living screen such as a fence or wall.
10. Maintenance of Screenings. All screening shall be maintained to
continue its effectiveness. All plantings shall be guaranteed for a
period of two years after installation.
11. Clear View of Intersections. Transitional bufferyards and screens
shall not impede sight lines at driveways or intersections.
§ 16.20.040 RARITAN CODE § 16.20.040
1.01:532
12. Conflict with Other Regulations. In the event that a regulation of
this section conflicts with one found elsewhere in this Title 16 the
more stringent regulation shall apply.
13. Reduction of Screening Requirement. When a condition such as
unusual topography, elevation in relation to adjacent properties,
size or shape of the parcel involved, or any other condition exists
which would make strict adherence to this Section 16.20.040.E
impractical or impossible, the Board may reduce the transitional
bufferyard and screening requirements.
14. Fencing as an Accessory Use. Fencing shall be considered as an
accessory use to a principal permitted use and are permitted in all
zones as set forth in Section 16.64.120.
15. Waivers and Exceptions. The Board may grant a waiver for a
reduction in any bufferyard standard as may be reasonable and
within the intent of the general purposes and provisions of this
section and if the literal enforcement of this section is
impracticable or will exact undue hardship because of peculiar
conditions pertaining to the land involved, as determined by the
Board.

F. Open Space.
1. General Requirements. At least 25% of any tract proposed for
planned development shall be in common open space and
distributed generally as follows:
a. A minimum of 10% of the gross tract area shall be in formal
recreation facilities, such as tennis courts, playgrounds,
swimming pools, ball-fields, and similar facilities.
b. A minimum of 10% of the gross tract area shall be in natural
features, vistas, significant wooded areas, vegetation and in
other usable open space which shall be defined as lands other
than in channels, floodways and on slopes in excess of 25% or
water bodies, whether used for recreation, retention or
detention purposes.
c. Five percent of the gross tract area may include all lands
excluded in Subsection (F)(1)(b) above and water bodies.
2. Recreation Facilities. The following recreational facilities should be
considered as part of any, but not necessarily all, planned
developments:
a. Trails: use to connect open space, between recreational
facilities and between buildings and other uses.
b. Bikeways: minimum width of six feet, optimum of eight feet,
and 10 feet where paths are also used for emergency vehicle
access. Keep grades under 10%, lower if for any length.
Machine-laid asphalt surface of four inch bituminous stabilized
base over an approved subbase are required. All turning radii
should be at least 12 feet with thirty-seven-foot radii required
where bicycle speeds approach 15 miles per hour. Curb cuts
and signing should be provided.
c. Playlots: minimum of 2,000 square feet for toddlers and up to
5,000 square feet for older children. Primarily for use by preschool-
age children. Facilities include swings, slides, play
sculptures and benches for parents. Effective service radius of
one block or one-eighth of a mile. Approximately one playlot for
each 400 persons or 100 children.
§ 16.20.040 RARITAN CODE § 16.20.040
1.01:536
d. Playgrounds: designed for a variety of uses, and the equipment
should reflect the patronage. Sandboxes and play sculpture for
young children, basketball courts or backboards for older
youths, paved areas for various activities, and sunny and quiet
areas for the elderly should be provided. The size of the
playgrounds should be based on population as follows:
Population
Size
(acres)
2,000 3.25
3,000 4.0
4,000 5.0
5,000 6.0
e. Tennis: one for each 100 dwelling units. Parking should be
provided on the basis of four per court.
f. Swimming pools: provide three square feet of pool area for
each resident above three years of age. Provide for wading
pools.
3. Other Considerations.
a. Orientation of recreational facilities generally should run in a
northeast-southwest direction.
b. Carefully orient passive recreational facilities. The southerly
exposure is the warmest and captures the short fall, winter and
spring sun. During the summer, it can be uncomfortable, but
this can be relieved by landscaping.
c. Small garden plots are also valid recreational opportunities,
particularly for the elderly. Orient toward the south.
d. Recreational facilities should be operated for the residents of
the development. They should not be commercial enterprises
open to anyone who pays a fee.
G. Lighting.
1. Submission of Plans. Plans and evidence of compliance shall
include the following:
a. Description of outdoor lamp/luminaire combinations including
component specifications such as lamps, reflectors, optics,
angle of cutoff, supports, poles and include manufacturers
catalog cuts.
b. Locations and description of every outdoor light fixture and
hours of operation, their aiming angles and mounting heights.
§ 16.20.040 CODE ADOPTION § 16.20.040
1.01:537
c. Computer generated photometric grid showing footcandle
readings every 10 feet and the average footcandles for the site.
d. Foundation details for light poles.
2. The style of the light and light standard shall be consistent with the
architectural style of the principal building and should be
coordinated with the landscaping for the site.
3. Maximum Height of Lights.
a. The light shall be measured from ground level to its highest
point and shall include the base.
b. The maximum height in residential parking lots and in off
street residential situations is 15 feet.
c. The maximum height in non-residential uses is 25 feet, but in
no case shall be higher than the buildings(s).
4. Freestanding lights shall be so located and protected to avoid being
easily damaged by vehicles.
5. Lighting should be located along streets, parking areas, at
intersections and where various types of circulation systems
merge, intersect or split.
6. Lighting of Walkways/Bikeways and Parks. Where special lighting
is to be provided for walkways, bikeways, or parks, the following
requirements shall apply:
a. The walkway, pathway, or ground area shall be illuminated to a
level of no more than 0.5 foot-candles.
b. The vertical illumination levels at a height of five feet above
grade shall be no more than 0.5 foot-candles.
c. Lighting fixtures shall be designed to direct light downward,
and the light sources shall have an initial output of no more
than 1,000 lumens.
7. Stairways and sloping or rising paths, building entrances and exits
require illumination.
8. All non-essential outdoor lighting fixtures, including display
lighting, shall be turned off after close of business, unless needed
for safety or security, in which case the lighting shall be reduced to
a minimum level necessary as determined by the Board (nonessential
may apply to: display, aesthetic, parking and sign
lighting).
9. Light Trespass. The maximum illumination at five feet inside an
adjoining residential parcel or public right-of-way or beyond, from
an artificial light is 0.25 horizontal footcandles and 0.25 vertical
§ 16.20.040 RARITAN CODE § 16.20.040
1.01:538
footcandles. Said illumination likewise measured inside an
adjoining commercial or industrial parcel or on a public roadway,
or beyond, shall not exceed 0.5 horizontal footcandles or 0.5
footcandles. No line of sight to a glaring light source is permitted
from five feet or more inside a residential or public right-of-way
property line by an observer viewing from a position that is level
with or higher than the ground below the fixture. Compliance is
achieved with fixture shielding, directional control designed into
the fixture, fixture location, fixture height, fixture aim, or a
combination of these factors.
10. General Lighting Design. The bulbs in outdoor light fixtures
emitting from 600 to 1200 lumens shall be frosted glass or covered
by frosted glass or other similarly translucent cover. An outdoor
fixture emitting more than 1200 lumens except motion detector
activated lighting, shall be full cutoff and fully shielded to an
observer at the property line. This can be achieved with fixture
location, mounting height, natural or artificial barriers on the
fixture owner's property, fixture shielding, and other fixture design
features.
A spotlight of less than 1800 lumens need not be full cutoff or
covered by a translucent cover if its center beam is aimed at a
point not beyond any property lines and no higher than 45° below
horizontal, and is motion detector activated and cycles off after five
minutes.
Generally, luminaries should not be located closer to the property
line than a distance equal to three times the fixture's mounting
height above grade at the property line.
11. Emergency lighting and traffic control lighting is exempt.
12. The use of search lights, laser lighting, or lights that pulse, flash,
rotate or simulate motion for advertising or promotions is
prohibited.
13. Tower lighting shall not be permitted unless required by the FAA.
Required lighting shall be of the lowest allowed intensity and red
unless specifically forbidden under FAA requirements.
14. With the exception of structures having exceptional symbolic
significance such as churches, public buildings or buildings of
historic significance in the community, exterior buildings and other
vertical structures shall not be illuminated. When buildings and
other structures having symbolic or historic significance are to be
illuminated, the design for the illumination must be approved by
the Planning Board.
15. Buildings and other vertical structures.
§ 16.20.040 CODE ADOPTION § 16.20.040
1.01:539
a. The maximum illumination on any vertical surface or angular
roof surface shall not exceed 5.0 foot-candles.
b. Lighting fixtures shall be carefully located, aimed, and shielded
so that light is directed only onto the building surface. Lighting
fixtures shall not be directed toward adjacent streets or roads.
c. Lighting fixtures mounted on the building and designed to
"wash" the building surface with light are preferred.
d. To the extent practicable, lighting fixtures shall be directed
below the horizontal rather than above the horizontal plane.
16. Landscaping. When landscaping is to be illuminated, the Planning
Board shall first approve a landscape lighting plan that presents
the purpose and objective of the lighting, shows the location of all
lighting fixtures and what landscaping each is to illuminate, and
demonstrates that the installation will not generate excessive light
levels, cause glare, or direct light beyond the landscaping into the
night sky.
17. Lighting of Exterior Display/Sales Areas. Lighting levels on exterior
display/sale areas shall be adequate to facilitate the activities
taking place in such locations. Lighting of such areas shall not be
used to attract attention to the business. Signs allowed under local
ordinance are to be used for the purpose. The applicant shall
designate areas to be considered display/sale areas and areas to be
used as parking or passive vehicle storage areas. The designation
must be approved by the Planning Board.
a. Areas designated as parking or passive vehicle storage areas
shall be illuminated in accordance with the requirements for
parking areas suggested elsewhere in this section.
b. Areas designated as exterior display/sales areas shall be
illuminated so that the maximum illumination level is thirtyfive-
foot-candles in feature display areas and twenty-footcandles
in general display areas. In no case shall the
illuminance in any exterior selling areas exceed 10 times that
of the surrounding area.
c. Light fixtures shall be cut-off fixtures, and shall be located,
mounted, aimed, and shielded so that direct light is not cast
onto adjacent streets or properties.
d. Fixtures shall be mounted no more than 20 feet above grade,
and mounting poles shall be located either inside the
illuminated area or no more than 10 feet away from the outside
edge of the illuminated area.
18. Lighting of Outdoor Facilities. Outdoor nighttime facilities
(concerts, athletic contests, etc.) have unique lighting needs.
§ 16.20.040 RARITAN CODE § 16.20.040
1.01:540
Illumination levels vary, depending on the nature of the activity.
The regulations in this section are intended to allow adequate
lighting for such events while minimizing sky glow, reducing glare
and unwanted illumination of surrounding streets, properties, and
reducing energy consumption. The design plan shall include a
discussion of the lighting requirements of various areas and how
those requirements will be met.
19. Lighting of Gasoline Station/Convenience Store Aprons and
Canopies. Lighting levels on gasoline station/convenience store

across a stream, watercourse or swale, or upon the floodway or
right-of-way thereof, to maintain as nearly as possible in its present
state the stream, watercourse, swale, floodway or right-of-way
during the duration of such activity and to return it to its original or
equal condition after such activity is completed.
3. No person shall block, divert, disturb, impede the flow of, alter or
construct any structure or deposit any material or thing, or commit
any act which will affect normal or flood flow in any communal
stream or watercourse without having obtained prior approval

excess or scrap building materials shall be removed or
destroyed to the satisfaction of the Construction Official, prior
to issuance of an occupancy permit.
c. Changes in Elevation. No change shall be made in the elevation
or contour of any lot or site by the removal of earth to another
lot or site by the removal of earth to another lot or site other
than shown on an approved site plan. Minimal changes in
elevations or contours necessitated by field conditions shall be
shown on the final plat and indicated as a change from the
preliminary, or if final approval has been granted, said changes
shall be shown on the as-built plans.
d. Temporary Improvements. Prior to or during construction, the
Township Engineer may require the installation or
construction of improvements to prevent or correct temporary
conditions on the site which could cause personal injury,
damage or property or constitute a health hazard. These
conditions may result from erosion and landslide, flooding,
heavy construction traffic, creation of steep grades and
pollution. Improvements may include berms, mulching,
sediment traps, detention and retention basins, grading,
plantings, retaining walls, culverts, pipes, guardrails,
temporary roads and others appropriate to the specific
condition. All temporary improvements shall remain in place
and in operation until otherwise directed by the Township
Engineer.
L. Street Furniture.
1. Street furniture is the manmade element of an urban landscape.

1.01:544
recreational activities and outside all major public and commercial
or office buildings as appropriate.
3. Bus shelters may be required at major intersections. The stops
themselves should be on the far side of the intersection so as not to
block other vehicles or limit passage through the intersection. It is
desirable to provide indentations to accommodate the buses off the
main travel routes. The shelter should be designed to keep rain off
those waiting for the buses and to break the wind. They should not
be entirely enclosed to allow the interiors to be readily observed.
4. Trash receptacles should be located near recreational activities, at
street corners, at entrances and exits to buildings and where
people naturally congregate such as near bus stops and under
street lights. Open-weave receptacles should be avoided because
wind blows small bits of paper and debris from them.
5. Dog waste receptacles shall be located near trails, sidewalks and
other walkways as determined by the Planning Board. [Amended
by Ord. 06-11]
M. Engineering Design Considerations.

intervals. A minimum of two stakes shall be used for inlet
stakeout.
23. Detention and retention basins shall be of a free-form configuration
with 3:1 slopes maximum. A lot flow channel should be provided
with 2% bottom grading to the channel. Recreational use of such
basins shall be considered. Geometric or other manmade
appearance of such facilities is discouraged. Location of detention
basins should not be adjacent to roadways unless sufficiently
landscaped and graded so as to be aesthetically pleasing.
24. Islands in cul-de-sacs should contain low-maintenance landscaping,
such as shade trees, pines and other tree form evergreens.
25. Minor residential streets shall be limited to a minimum centerline
radius of 100 feet. As designated by the Township Engineer, tight
horizontal curves shall be expanded to 30 feet on twenty-four-foot
wide roads, and to 40 feet on thirty-foot wide roads to
accommodate restricted turning movements, occasional parking
and supportive emergency services. All other roads of collector or
arterial type shall be designated in accordance to American
Association of State Highway Officials standards to accommodate
the design volumes and speeds.

of the curbing at these locations.
33. In addition to the above requirements, the design of the drainage
system shall follow those standards found in N.J.A.C. 7:8-5 et seq.
and N.J.A.C. 7:8-6 et seq., and in the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection New Jersey Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual. The best management practices
selected shall be based upon the specific conditions of the property
in question after consultation with the Township Engineer.
[Amended by Ord. 04-16]
N. Other Considerations.
1. Energy Conservation.
a. Buildings should be located to best take advantage of the site;
winds, sun, cold air drainage, humidity, vegetation, landforms,
etc.
b. Plantings and structures should be located to block
undesirable winds and sun, and increase wind and ventilation
where desirable.
c. Water bodies should be considered for reflecting light and
cooling.
d. Snow drifting should be considered.
e. Applicants should consult a publication entitled Landscape
Planning and Energy Conservation before designing site plans.
2. Tree Protection During Construction. [Amended by Ord. 06-11]
a. The tree protection area shall be located at least 15 feet from
the trunk of the tree(s) to be retained. Where there is a group
of trees or woodlands, the tree protection area shall be the
aggregate of the protection areas for the individual trees.
b. Tree protection areas shall be shown on the landscape plan
and the grading plan.
c. Prior to any site work, clearing, tree removal, grading or
construction the tree protection area shall be delineated.
d. Where groups of trees are to be preserve the area shall be
delineated with tree protection fencing as follows:
i. All woodland and forest and forest areas proposed for
preservation must be fenced with blaze orange fencing
with a warning sign placed every 100 linear feet along the
fenced area.
§ 16.20.040 RARITAN CODE § 16.20.040
1.01:548
ii. No clearing, grading, or land disturbance may begin until
the tree fencing has been installed and inspected by the
Township Engineer or their designee.
iii. No construction, stockpiling, storage, dumping, or heavy
machinery may take place inside the fenced area.
e. Tree protection fencing erected with a minimum height of four
feet, and placed a minimum of 15 feet from the trunk of the
tree or along the drip line, which ever is greater. Snow fencing
may be used. However, chain link fence may be required if
warranted by site conditions and rarity of the plant.
[Amended by Ord. 10-27]
f. Any tree protection fencing shall be maintained and remain in
place until all construction on site is completed.
g. Trees being removed shall not be felled, pushed or pulled into a
tree protection area or into trees that are to be retained.
h. No vehicles, construction equipment, construction materials,
or waste materials shall be placed within the protection areas.
i. No toxic materials shall be placed within 100 feet of the tree
protection area.

damaged and is unable to survive, tree replacement shall occur
as provided in compliance with Section 16.20.040.T.
[Amended by Ord. 06-11; 10-27]
3. Performance Standards of the Zoning Ordinance. The provisions of
Chapter 16.74, shall be observed. As a condition of any of approval
and the continuance of any use, occupancy of any structure and
operation of any process or equipment, the applicant shall supply
written evidence, satisfactory to the Planning Board or its
designated representative, that the proposed use, structure,
process or equipment will conform fully with all of the applicable
performance standards.
4. Barrier-Free Design. The provisions of the New Jersey
Administrative Code, Title 17, Chapter 19A, pertaining to barrier-
§ 16.20.040 CODE ADOPTION § 16.20.040
1.01:549
free design, shall be observed in the design of all improvements as
appropriate.
5. Maintenance. The provisions of Chapter 16.74 and other
appropriate sections of this Code, and all conditions of site plan
approval, including maintaining all site improvements as approved
or intended, shall be constantly observed as a condition of
continued occupancy of and use of premises or structures.
6. Construction Access. In order to assure public health, welfare and
safety through residential areas and to preserve the structural
integrity of pavements designed for residential loadings, prior to
preliminary approval, the developer shall stipulate means for
construction access to the proposed development for all road and
building materials, equipment, supplies and manpower.
Construction access may be categorized as direct external access
to the site and internal access through the site or adjoining sites.
a. Direct External Construction Access. In most cases, small nonsectionalized
developments will not require a separate
construction access, provided that there is direct construction
access to the site from a state highway. Where construction
access to a site is only available via roads of a lesser category
than a municipal arterial road, or where construction access
must be through earlier improved sections of the same or other
developments, the applicant shall be responsible for off-site
and/or off-tract improvements to said access route in the form
of sidewalks, structural repairs and additional macadam
surface coursing as necessary to permit the access route to
withstand or be repaired from the abnormal loading of the road
or roads, and to assure pedestrian safety along the route. In
lieu of physical improvements to this type of construction
access route, the Planning Board may require, as an alternate,
the posting of a performance bond to cover the cost of damage
to less than arterial construction access routes.
b. Internal Construction Access. Construction access for staged
projects shall, when possible, be via a separate construction
route which avoids improved sections of the development and
adjoining developed properties. The construction access may
take a different route as succeeding sections of the
development are constructed. Such an internal construction
access route shall be maintained by the developer for the
duration of the project to such a standard as to permit access
for materials and equipment and shall normally consist of five
inches of 2 1/2 inch quarry blend topped with two inches of 3/4
inch road stone. All sectioned developments shall have the
sectioning plan designed with construction access as a primary
determinant in the sequence of development of the site.

§ 16.21.030. Water Quality Evaluation. [Amended by Ord. 05-4]
A. Purpose and Intent. The objective of the water quality evaluation is to
assess if the proposed water supply sources to a development or
commercial establishment meet NJDEP drinking water quality MCLs. In
§ 16.21.020 RARITAN CODE § 16.21.030
1.01:574
§ 16.21.040. Hydrogeologic Report Requirements. [Amended by
Ord. 05-4]
the event that one or more constituents do not meet the applicable
MCLs, standard treatment systems need to be readily available.
B. Groundwater Quality Determination.
1. Groundwater quality will be determined for the pumping well and
on-site observation wells as part of this program. Groundwater
samples from the pumping well, used for the aquifer pumping test,
will be collected during the pumping phase of that test.
2. The water samples from the on-site observation wells can be
collected either three days in advance or three days after the
pumping test has been completed. The samples must be collected
in accordance with the NJDEP Field Procedures Manual. At a
minimum, the samples shall be analyzed by an NJDEP-certified
laboratory for: hardness, gross alpha particle activity, arsenic, iron,
manganese, copper, lead, nitrate, and total and fecal coliform
bacteria. The samples shall also be analyzed for volatile organic
compounds for which the United States Environmental Protection
Agency or NJDEP has determined maximum contaminant levels
using USEPA Method 524.2.
3. During the pumping test, field measurements of pH, conductivity/
total dissolved solids and temperature shall be made with
calibrated instruments.
4. If site conditions or the site history indicate the potential historic
use of materials containing heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides, or
other volatile or semi-volatile organic compounds at or near the
site, these analyses must also be conducted.
5. Based on past historical operations at the site or at nearby
properties, the Board, at its discretion, may require additional
analyses of the groundwater to assess current and potential future
impacts. The results of the water sample analyses will be used to
assess background (pre-development) water quality conditions.
A. A hydrogeologic report must be submitted with each application for
subdivision of two or more lots and all site plans. This report shall
document the design and implementation of the aquifer test and
include the following data, information and analysis:
1. Calculations of aquifer characteristics such as transmissivity and
storage coefficient, calculations of the cone of depression, potential
impacts to adjacent well owners, and an evaluation of the long-term
sustained yield for the wells.
2. All water-level measurements obtained during the three phases of
the aquifer test in electronic format acceptable to the Township.
§ 16.21.030 CODE ADOPTION § 16.21.040
1.01:575
§ 16.21.050. Evaluation Results. [Amended by Ord. 05-4]
3. A detailed hydrogeologic description of the aquifers encountered
beneath the site and adjacent properties.
4. A detailed evaluation of the water-supply demand for an average
and peak day. This demand should be supported with information
on anticipated population, expected unit density, size of units, lawn
and garden irrigation needs, pool filling requirements, and other
anticipated water uses.
5. An inventory of all wells within 1,000 feet of the proposed
subdivision/site plan boundaries appended and placed on a base
map of the site area. This inventory must be submitted in electronic
format acceptable to the Township.
6. Figures depicting site geology, topography, surface water bodies,
water-level elevations, groundwater flow, and development plans.

disposal systems on groundwater quality. A site plan depicting
topography, actual and planned well locations, septic leach field
locations, and fracture trace locations at a minimum scale of one
inch equals 200 feet should be included. For any and all locations
where a fracture or set of fractures intersects one or more wells
and/or septic leach fields, a detailed assessment of treatment
technologies should be included. The treatment technologies
should provide adequate assurances that any and all groundwater
pumped from the wells will satisfy Federal and New Jersey
Drinking Water Standards (MCLs) and will not be degraded by the
septic leach field discharges.
9. The hydrogeologic report shall be prepared and signed by a
qualified hydrogeologist using applicable sections of GSR 29 or
successor document as a guide.
10. The hydrogeologic report shall include the name and license
number of the well driller and pump installer. The report shall
include the names of the persons and firm responsible for
collecting the water-level measurements. In addition, the report
shall include copies of the completed NJDEP Well Records.
A. Evaluation.
1. Precipitation. A test conducted during a period in which 0.5 inches
or more of precipitation are recorded at or near the site must be
repeated or technical documentation provided that the
§ 16.21.040 RARITAN CODE § 16.21.050
1.01:576
precipitation event had no impact on water levels 24 hours before,
during, and 24 hours after the test.
2. Background Phase. Antecedent influences must be determined,
and, if necessary, water-level data from the pumping phase and
recovery phase must be corrected. Insufficient data to assess these
influences will require repetition of all three phases of the aquifer
test.
3. Pumping Phase.
a. If the pumping rate does not exceed the average daily demand
by 120% or the peak-day demand cannot be pumped within a
twenty-four-hour period, the aquifer beneath the site may be
deemed insufficient to meet the proposed demands and the
applicant may need to review and adjust the site demand and
development units. Some alternatives include:
i. Repeating the pumping test with two or more pumping
wells to achieve average or twenty-four-hour peak-day
demand for a development. This may be particularly
applicable for large developments in low yielding bedrock
aquifer systems.
ii. Decreasing the number of developed lots.
iii. Re-arranging the lot configuration.
b. If the pumping rate varies by more than 10% of the average
flow rate, the entire test shall be repeated.
c. If the pump shuts down during the pumping phase, the entire
test must be repeated.
d. If water levels in the pumping and/or observation wells exceed
the measurement capacity of the devices used for measuring
changes in water levels and measurements are not recorded
with other devices in accordance with the schedule listed in
Appendix A, the test must be repeated.
e. If the pumping data indicate a change in aquifer transmissivity
as a result of fracture dewatering, all analyses of the potential
radius of influence and impacts to neighbors, streams, and
wetlands must be conducted using the lower value of aquifer
transmissivity. If this lower aquifer transmissivity indicates
that the anticipated demand cannot be supported by the
aquifer beneath the site, the applicant will need to review and
adjust the site demand and development units as outlined in
Subsection A.3.a. above.
4. Recovery Phase. For purposes of evaluating water-level recovery,
the recovery phase duration will be equal to the pumping phase
duration. For example, if the pumping phase is eight hours in
§ 16.21.050 CODE ADOPTION § 16.21.050
1.01:577
§ 16.21.060. Aquifer Test Procedures. [Amended by Ord. 05-4]
duration, water levels eight hours after the pump has been turned
off will be compared to the pre-pumping static water level to assess
recovery magnitude and degree of recovery.
a. If water-level recovery is less than 90% of full recovery at the
end of a recovery phase of similar duration as the pumping
phase, the applicant must show through standard/recognized
aquifer test analytical methods and calculations that the well
or wells are capable of full recovery. If full recovery cannot be
shown or groundwater mining/dewatering has occurred, the
applicant will need to review and adjust the site demands and
development units as outlined in Subsection A.3.a.
5. Neighboring Well.
a. If the drawdown is measured or projected to be more than one
foot at any existing adjacent property well or along the
subdivision boundary, the applicant's hydrogeologist must
evaluate long-term potential impacts to adjacent properties
based on the actual operating condition of wells in that zone or
along that portion of the subdivision/site plan boundary.
b. If a drawdown of five feet or more (This may be adjusted by a
Township Hydrogeologist and should take lot sizes into
account) is noted in any existing adjacent property well, or is
projected at any property boundary, then the aquifer will be
deemed to have insufficient transmissivity and capacity to
support the proposed subdivision/site plan. The applicant will
need to review the site demand, development units, and well
locations to ensure that drawdown will not exceed five feet at
any site boundaries.
6. Impacts to streams and wetlands. If drawdown is measured or
projected to induce leakage from streams or wetlands such that
base flow in these streams will be directly reduced or wetlands
partially or entirely dewatered, then the demand and development
units must be reduced to prevent adverse impacts to stream flow
and wetlands.
7. Additional Testing. Any test that must be repeated, restarted, or reconducted
at a reduced demand, must satisfy all the requirements
of this chapter including but not limited to renotification of all
property owners within 500 feet and resubmission of an aquifer
test plan for Board approval prior to implementation of the test.
A. Procedures.
1. The first test phase will involve the collection of background water
levels prior to the start of the test. The second test phase will
involve the pumping of water from the well and the monitoring of
§ 16.21.050 RARITAN CODE § 16.21.060
1.01:578
water-level drawdown in the observation and pumping wells. The
third test phase will involve the measurement of water-level
recovery in the observation and pumping wells after the pump has
been shut down. This third phase of the test must, at a minimum,
be the same length as the pumping phase.
2. The aquifer test (all three phases) shall not be conducted during a
precipitation event or events in which total precipitation equals or
exceeds 0.5 inches. Precipitation must be recorded with a National
Weather Service acceptable rain gauge on site during all phases of
testing and measurements for each day must be included in the
hydrogeologic report. If precipitation occurs during the test, the
applicant shall provide precipitation amounts and sufficient data to
show that the precipitation did not recharge the aquifer during the
test and impair the test results. If precipitation amounts exceeding
0.5-inches are recorded, the test may have to be repeated.
3. The pumping equipment must be installed in the pumping well at
least 24 hours prior to the start of the background phase.
4. Prior to starting the background phase, water levels in the test well
and observation wells must be permitted to stabilize for a minimum
of three days after all drilling activities are completed.
5. During the background phase, water levels should be collected at a
minimum of one measurement per hour for the twenty-four-hour
period prior to the start of the pumping test. It is the applicant's
responsibility to collect sufficient data to determine background
conditions and to ensure that antecedent influences can be fully
characterized. Barometric measurements and additional waterlevel
measurements can be made by the applicant to evaluate the
change in water levels resulting from barometric pressure changes
and/or influences from off-site pumping.
6. On the day of the pumping phase, water levels shall be collected
from the pumping and observation wells to determine static water
level conditions prior to the start of pumping. Water levels in wells
on neighboring properties should be allowed to stabilize to at or
near static prior to the start of pumping. For any observation well
which has been pumped within the 24 hours preceding the test, two
depth-to-water measurements, at least one hour apart, shall be
collected to assess if the well has fully recovered prior to the start
of pumping.
7. When the aquifer test is started, the pumping flow rate shall be
adjusted, within the first several minutes of pumping, to a uniform
(constant) pumping rate as required for a constant-rate test and in
accordance with the approved aquifer test plan. The flow rate shall
not vary by more than 10% throughout the test. If the flow rate
fluctuates more than 10%, the test may be deemed invalid and the
§ 16.21.060 CODE ADOPTION § 16.21.060
1.01:579
applicant will be required to repeat the notification and testing
process.
8. Water-level measurements during the pumping phase of the test
shall be collected in accordance with Table A-1. This same schedule
shall be followed for the recovery phase of testing upon shut down
of the pump in the test well.

60 to 120 Minutes 10 Minutes 10 Minutes
2 to 24 Hours 30 Minutes 30 Minutes
9. Aquifer Pumping Test Rate and Duration. The rate and duration of
the aquifer test will depend upon the size of the proposed
development and expected average and peak daily demands for
water.
a. The average daily and average yearly water demand for human
consumption within the subdivision or site plan must be
determined according to the guidelines in N.J.A.C. 7:10-12.6.
Demand calculations must include irrigation systems, if
proposed, and water usage for filling of swimming pools and all
other demands. The peak-day demand is twice the average
daily demand. For non-residential developments, peak-day
demand must include seasonal factors.
b. The pumping phase must simulate peak-day demand and
therefore, the pumping phase duration is not to extend more
than 24 hours. The minimum pumping rate is calculated by
dividing the peak-day demand by 1440 minutes per twentyfour-
hour period. If the well yield is sufficient, shorter pumping
periods can be used, but should be no less than eight hours in
duration.
c. If the demand exceeds 100,000 gallons per day, a New Jersey
Water Allocation Permit must be obtained from the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection.

§ 16.21.070. Observation Well Requirements-Well Testing.
[Amended by Ord. 05-4]
d. For mixed developments containing both residential and
nonresidential properties, each portion will be tested
separately. Wells installed for the residential portion must be
used as observation wells for the nonresidential testing and
wells installed for nonresidential use must be used as
observation wells for the residential testing.
e. The pumping rate will be determined by equipping the
discharge pipe with a calibrated flow meter to measure flow
rate and determine total volume pumped from the well.
f. The discharge shall be directed so that it leaves the site
without infiltrating to the aquifer. The pumped water discharge
location must be at least 200 feet from the pumping well. Any
and all permits required by the NJDEP and/or local authorities
for the discharge of pumped water must be obtained prior to
starting the test.
A. Observation Wells.
1. The number of observation wells required per aquifer test will
depend on the number of dwelling units and/or commercial water
demand. New and existing observation wells may be located such
that they can be used as future water-supply wells but they shall be
located in such a manner that will yield the most accurate
information concerning the aquifer.
2. Observation wells should be completed to similar depths as the
pumping well.
3. Observation wells must be located parallel and perpendicular to
strike of the primary regional fractures and those intersected by
the tested well. Additional observation wells should be located to
evaluate potential secondary fractures and impacts to adjacent
properties.
4. A fracture trace analysis showing the location and orientation of
fracture lineaments must be included with the Aquifer Test Plan.
This same analysis with additional information regarding septic
system locations must be included in the Final Hydrogeologic
Report. The fracture trace analysis must be used to identify all
observation wells on the site and to identify neighboring property
owner's wells to be monitored during the test.
5. All wells must be located in accordance with the minimum
distances required by N.J.A.C. 7:10 12.12.
6. One observation well should be located within 200 feet of the test
well and at least one observation well should be located along a

fracture trace or preferential fracture direction between 200 and
500 feet from the pumping well.
7. For residential developments of two new residential units or more,
the number of observation wells shall be as shown in Table B-1.
8. Non-Residential Developments: For non-residential developments
with anticipated daily demands exceeding 800 gallons per day, the
number of observation wells shall be as shown in Table B-2.
9. The observation wells and the pumping well must have a geologic
log describing the depth and types of soils and rocks encountered
and the depth and yields of all water-bearing fracture zones. The
logs must include static water-level measurements and total yield
estimates for each well.

§ 16.24N.080. Performance and Design Standards. [Amended by
Ord. 14-20]
The following performance and design standards shall be used the
redevelopment of the Junction Road Redevelopment Area. "Shall" is
mandatory and "should" is permissive.
4. Building setbacks from parking spaces, driveways and private
streets. The building setback, measured from the edge of paving or
curbing to the closest point of a building, shall be a minimum of 15
feet. Porches in the yard area between the front of a building and a
parking space and not exceeding 50 square feet in floor area may
be setback a minimum of 12 feet. Porches in the yard area between
the side of a building and a parking space and not exceeding 150
square feet in floor area may be setback a minimum of 11 feet.
A. Building Design Requirements.
1. Buildings should have architectural features and patterns that
provide visual interest from the perspective of pedestrians and
motorists. Buildings should include substantial variation in mass
through the use of the three main elements of base, field and
entablature in the facade. Primary building facades shall be
enhanced by the use of vertical and horizontal elements, such as
plinths, pilasters, arches, and cornices. The field of the building
shall be differentiated from the base by a horizontal transition line.
The design of the base, as well as the quality and durability of its
materials, should be emphasized in the architectural design.
2. Doorways, windows and other openings in the facade of buildings
should be proportioned to reflect a pedestrian scale. Multiple front
entrances or architectural features should be incorporated into the
building design in order to produce human scale elements in the
facade of the buildings.
3. Colors should be selected to create a common color palette (e.g.,
warms or cools together; primary or complementary together) to
be used throughout the redevelopment(s). Contrasting colors
should be used for accent purposes in highlighting architectural
features and limited to 10% of the facade area or less.
B. Conservation Easement. Any use or disturbance of the conservation
easement shall require the written permission of the easement holder,
unless already permitted by the language of the easement. The
easement holder may impose conditions on the permission, including
but not limited to, replacement of trees and other standards for revegetation
and security instruments to ensure same. Such permission
shall not be construed to limit the requirement of the redeveloper to
obtain any other governmental approval pertaining to the use or
disturbance of the conservation easement.

1.01:642
C. Green Design Requirements. The design of buildings and their site
development components shall promote the conservation of energy
through the use of site planning, architectural elements and
construction techniques to minimize energy consumption and to
provide for the maximum utilization of renewable energy sources. With
the submission of a preliminary site plan or subdivision, whichever
comes first, the redeveloper shall prepare and submit a "Sustainable
Design Assessment." The Sustainable Design Assessment shall set forth
ways in which the proposed development will utilize building design,
construction materials, mechanical systems, site design and
development techniques, and facility management practices which
promote natural resource preservation and the minimization of energy
consumption. The Sustainable Design Assessment shall include and
address the following topics in narrative and graphic form as
appropriate:
1. Sustainable site development.
a. The minimization of site disturbance and soil erosion during
construction and the maximization of tree retention.
b. The extent to which natural drainage systems can be utilized
and naturalized control structures designed following NJDEP
Best Management Practices and, if feasible, green
infrastructure, for storm water management.
c. The preservation or restoration of natural site features.
d. The use of building orientation and landscaping features to
capitalize on passive heating and cooling.
e. Any provision for allowing community gardens.
2. Water efficiency.
a. The use of captured rainwater for internal and external water
demand, if feasible.
b. The use of low-flow and no flow fixtures and fittings.
3. Energy efficiency. The Sustainable Design Assessment will include
a narrative if any of the following techniques in promoting energy
efficiency are proposed (including their extent) in the
redevelopment of the tract:
a. The use of passive solar heating/cooling and natural
ventilation.
b. Enhancing the penetration of daylight to interior spaces to
reduce the need for artificial lighting.
§ 16.24N.080 CODE ADOPTION § 16.24N.080
1.01:643
c. The use of a thermally efficient envelope to reduce the size of
the HVAC system or systems over conventional construction
methods.

D. Landscaping and Tree Preservation. The following performance
standards shall supplement the buffer yard standards of Section
16.20.040.D of the Land Development Code:
1. Landscape design. The protection of wooded areas, specimen trees,
and existing vegetation suitable for landscaping within the
redevelopment shall be a factor in determining the location of open
space, buildings, underground services, walks, paved areas,
playgrounds, parking areas and finished grade levels and shall be
based on a survey of the natural features of the tract.
2. Perimeter buffer requirements. Landscape buffers shall be
required along all perimeter property lines and public rights-of-way

C. General Development Plan Approval Procedure.
1. A developer seeking approval of a planned development may
submit a general development plan to the Planning Board prior to
the granting of preliminary approval of the development or a
section of the development by the Planning Board.
2. The Planning Board shall grant or deny the general development
plan within 95 days after submission of a complete application to
the Administrative Officer, or within such further time as may be
consented to by the developer. Failure of the Planning Board to act
within the period prescribed shall constitute general development
plan approval of the planned development.
D. General Development Plan; Timing Schedule; Modification. In the event
that the developer seeks to modify the proposed timing schedule, such
modification shall require the approval of the Planning Board. The
Planning Board shall, in deciding whether or not to grant approval of
the modification, take into consideration prevailing economic and
market conditions, anticipated and actual needs for residential units
and nonresidential space within the municipality and the region, and
the availability and capacity of public facilities to accommodate the
proposed development.
E. Modification of General Development Plan; Requirement for Hearing.
1. Except as provided hereunder, the developer shall be required to
gain the prior approval of the Planning Board if, after approval of
the general development plan, the developer wishes to make any
variation in the location of land uses within the planned
development or to increase the density of residential development

size of the various use need areas and their distribution. It shall not
generally approve areas of less than five acres except when such
site is considered adequate for its specific use, and it shall make
certain that a reasonable portion of required dedicated area shall
be located so as to specifically serve the needs of the development
where located. Areas utilized for stormwater detention facilities
shall not be counted toward fulfilling minimum open space area
requirements for a cluster development. Areas utilized for
stormwater retention facilities shall be counted toward fulfilling
open-space area requirements.
E. Disposition of Dedicated Areas.
1. Dedicated areas shall be deemed free and clear of all mortgages
and encumbrances to the Township if the Township so indicates, as
provided in Subsection D of this section; or

maintenance and control of the area. If non-Township ownership is
approved, the maintenance responsibility shall be upon the
property owners within the bounds of the development. Upon
failure to maintain an orderly open space, the Township may and
can perform such maintenance and assess the cost to the
responsible property owner pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-43.
F. Right of Owner. Proposals in accordance with this section shall only be
approved by the Planning Board as above regulated if the lesser
requirements will promote the public health, safety, morals and general
welfare and will enhance property values within the area of
development and Raritan Township. Nothing herein shall be construed
as requiring a developer to elect this means of developing his or her
tract.
A. Permitted Exceptions. Height limitations stipulated elsewhere in this
Title shall not apply to church spires, belfries, cupolas, flagpoles, and
farm structures. Mechanical appurtenances such as condensers,

increased height; said height not to exceed a maximum of 75 feet.
2. The structure shall be located in the area behind the principal
residential structure as delineated by a line along the rear wall of
the structure and extending to either side of the property.
3. How Measured. Height shall be measured from the mean level of
the ground adjacent to the structure to a point midway between the
highest (ridge line) and lowest (eaves) point of the roof, but not
including chimneys, spires, towers, elevator penthouses and
similar projections. The mean level of the ground surrounding the
structure shall be computed by averaging the grade at the four
corners at the base of the structure or the four most extreme points
on the north, south, east and west sides of a principal structure
where multiple corners exist, or four points 90° apart from a
circular structure.
The base of earth berms surrounding a structure shall be
considered the grade from which height is measured.
A. Generally.
1. Front Yards. The minimum building setback shall be maintained as
required in Schedule I set out in the Appendix following this Title,
except that a structure to be erected on a vacant lot between two
improved lots may follow the average setback of the two improved
lots, but in any case, not less than 25 feet from the street right-ofway
line.

§ 16.64.130. Steep Slope Provisions. [Prior code § 15-9.31; amended
by Ord. 89-34]
subject to inspection of the Raritan Township Construction Department.
If it is determined by the Department that any fence or retaining wall
or portion thereof is not being maintained in a safe, sound and vertical
condition, the Department shall notify the owner of the lot in writing of
its findings and order such fence or retaining wall or portion thereof to
be repaired or removed within 15 days from the date of such written
notice to the owner.
H. Agricultural Fences. [Amended by Ord. 13-3]
1. Agricultural fencing for wildlife control. "Commercial farms" within
the meaning of the Right to Farm Act, N.J.S.A. 4:1C-1 et seq., may
install agricultural fencing for wildlife control, provided such
installation comports with the adopted Agricultural Management
Practice ("AMP") issued by the State Agricultural Development
Committee ("SADC") at N.J.A.C. 2:76-2A.9. Such fencing shall have
a maximum height of eight feet and shall be installed around the
tillable, cropland, pasture, hay or grazing land so as to minimize
the impact on neighboring properties.
2. For livestock or horses. "Commercial farms" within the meaning of
the Right to Farm Act, N.J.S.A. 4:1C-1 et seq., may install
agricultural fencing for livestock or horses, including but not
limited to split rail, PVC, tape, wire mesh and/or electric fencing.
Such fencing shall have a maximum height of six feet.
3. Noncommercial farms. Farms that do not qualify as a "commercial
farm" within the meaning of the Right to Farm Act, N.J.S.A. 4:1C-1
et seq., may not install wildlife control fencing, but are permitted to
install fences for livestock and horses, except that the maximum
height shall be six feet.
4. Prior to construction of fencing pursuant to this subsection, a
"commercial farm" must submit a survey or sketch reflecting the
proposed fencing and its location on the property to the Zoning
Officer for a written administrative review and approval. No zoning
permit or zoning permit fee shall be required.
A. Subdivisions. The applicable provisions of this Title relating to
minimum lot sizes and dwelling unit density for residential development
shall be modified in areas of slopes greater than 12%.
1. Determination of Modification.
a. This modification shall be determined by multiplying the net
land area (total area outside of rights-of-way) in various slope
categories by the following factors:
§ 16.64.120 CODE ADOPTION § 16.64.130
1.01:737
Slope
(percent) Factor
30 or greater 0
20 to 29 0.2
13 to 19 0.5
b. Slope calculations shall be based on elevation intervals of 10
feet.
2. The maximum number of dwelling units allowed on tract shall be
completed as follows:
(Land with 30% slopes x 0)
+ (Land with 20% to 29% slopes x 0.2)
+ (Land with 13% to 19% slopes x 0.5)
= total land available for development (TLD).
TLD
Minimum lot area
required per dwelling
unit (Schedule I set out
in the Appendix
following this title)
= Total number of dwelling units
permitted on tract
3. The concentration of development on lesser slopes is encouraged,
and the Planning Board may authorize development on lots smaller
than permitted in the zone district in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter for cluster residential development
(Section 16.64.020), where applicable provided that the total
number of dwelling units does not exceed the maximum allowed
after application of the above modification formula.
4. Subdivision plats shall be designed so that the larger lots resulting
from the application of this section shall be located in the steep
slope areas.
To calculate the amount of area by which lots in steep slope areas
shall be increased in size, the total land available for development
(TLD) calculated in Subsection (A)(2) of this section shall be
subtracted from the net land area (total area outside of right-ofway)
calculated in Subsection A.1.a. of this section. The difference
resulting from the subtraction shall be the area by which lots in
steep slope areas shall be increased in size. Lots shall be increased
in size in relation to the amount of area of steep slope on such lot
and steepness of such slope so that the largest increases occur on
those lots evidencing the largest amounts of areas of steep slope
and the greatest steepness of slope.

§ 16.70.020. Standards for Off-Street Parking Areas. [Prior code
§ 15-9.36; amended by Ord. 87-27; Ord. 06-11]
A. Size. Each off-street parking space shall measure not less than nine feet
by 18 feet, exclusive of access drives and aisles, except that parallel
curb parking spaces shall be eight feet by 23 feet. In areas which have
head-on parking other than 90°, the width of the space shall be not less
than nine feet measured at right angles to the parking lines, and these
lines shall extend to a point measuring 18 feet at right angles to the
curb or edge of the pavement. Except in the case of single-family
dwellings, no parking areas provided hereunder shall be established for
less than four spaces. The approving authority may alter the size of
parking spaces in length and width and the aisle width to allow for the
overhang of curbing, small cars, etc., where such adjustments are
appropriate to the intended use and traffic volume.
B. Access Aisles and Driveways.
1. Different Zone. No access drive, driveway, pathway or any other
means of egress or ingress shall be located in any residential zone
to provide access to uses other than those permitted in such
residential zone.

parking spaces shall not be less than:
a. Twenty-five feet wide for perpendicular parking;
b. Eighteen feet wide for 60° angle parking.
c. Fourteen feet wide for 30° and 45° angle parking.
C. General Standards for Parking Areas.
1. Design. Parking areas and access to parking areas shall be planned
and designed in accordance with accepted engineering parking
design principals such as those contained in Transportation and
Land Development, Institute of Transportation Engineers, 2nd
Edition, except as modified by requirements contained herein and
the design standards for site plan review of the site plan
regulations in Section 16.20.040.
2. Review. All plans shall be reviewed by the Township Engineer and
his or her recommendations shall be forwarded to the Planning
§ 16.70.010 CODE ADOPTION § 16.70.020
1.01:757
Board for its review pursuant to the regulations and procedures
governing site plan review.
3. Landscaping and Drainage. Parking areas shall be landscaped in
accordance with the design standards for site plan review to
minimize nuisance characteristics to adjacent properties and for
aesthetic reasons. They shall be drained and paved in accordance
with good engineering and construction practices as required by
the Township Engineer and Township specifications.
4. Markings and Access. Parking spaces, driveways and aisles shall be
clearly marked and delineated. For safety, fire-fighting purposes,
and efficiency direct through vehicular and pedestrian access for
emergency services and for the general public between adjacent
parking areas shall be provided.
D. Joint Provision of and Sharing of Parking Facilities. Any two or more
nonresidential uses may collectively provide the required off-street
parking spaces, provided that the total of such parking facilities shall
equal the sum of the spaces required for each participating use. Where
the Planning Board determines that the proposed location and
operation of the facilities and uses is such that the parking facilities
may be shared, then the parking may be provided in an amount to be
determined by the Planning Board based on the planned peak usage of
that use or structure which requires the highest number of spaces as
required by this chapter (i.e. if there is a development of two retail uses
that have peak usage times that differ substantially enough to
permitted shared parking then parking need only be required for that
peak parking period.)
E. Location of Parking Facilities.
1. Separate Lot. Parking facilities shall be located on the same lot as
the principal structure, except if space for the required off-street
parking is not available on the same lot, off-street parking may be
provided within 1,400 feet of the entrance of the use or structure,
provided that a legal agreement ensuring that the parking will be
available shall be approved by the Planning Board Attorney.
2. Parking in Rear. Whenever parking is provided in the rear of any
nonresidential structure or use, suitable rear entrance to the
structure or use shall be provided.
3. Parking Adjacent to Residence Zone. Where a nonresidential zone
abuts a residence zone, no parking spaces shall be located closer
than 25 feet from the residence zone line, and no driveway shall be
located closer than 15 feet to the residence zone line. For
additional site plan standards related to buffering from residential
and other properties see Section 16.20.040.

§ 16.70.030. Off-Street Loading and Unloading. [Prior code
§ 15-9.37; amended by Ord. 06-11]
All nonresidential uses shall have provisions for off-street loading and
unloading in accordance with Section 16.20.040. Such plans shall be
reviewed by the Township Engineer, and his or her recommendations shall
be forwarded to the Planning Board for its review under the design
standards for site plan review.
§ 16.70.040. Minimum Required Off-Street Parking. [Amended by
Ord. 06-11; Ord. 06-21]
It is the intent to require that all uses provide for adequate off-street
parking for employees, clients and visitors. The following standards are
expected to meet this objective. In the event that evidence is presented
that a particular use or establishment will require more off-street parking
spaces than are required by this Title, the Planning Board may require that
additional off-street spaces be provided.
A. In the event that the number of required parking spaces results in a
fraction of a space, one more parking space shall be provided.
B. Handicapped parking spaces shall be provided as required by the New
Jersey Administrative Code.
C. In the event of a mixed use, the required off-street parking shall be the
sum of the required off-street parking for each use. A mixed use is two
or more independent and/or distinct uses in the same or separate
structures, not the separate portions of any individual use. (i.e. a
manufacturing use will also contain warehousing and office space, but
the parking calculation shall be based on the gross floor area using the
manufacturing standard).
D. If an applicant can demonstrate, or the Planning Board determines, that
a particular use does not require all the required off-street parking at
the time of approval, the Planning Board may authorize up to 25% of
the required off-street parking to be landscaped and maintained as a
parking reserve or banked parking. Such parking reserve shall be
converted into parking (paved and in full conformance with this Title) at
such time as the Planning Board determines that the need exists. The
area to be reserved shall be fully designed at the time of site plan
approval. Any area reserved shall be counted as hard surface for the
purposes of storm water management computations and for
calculations in relation to hard surface coverage restrictions.
E. Vehicle Storage. Recognizing the difference between areas used for the
long-term storage of vehicles either for sale, for rent, for repair, or
other use the following standards shall supplement those standards
found elsewhere in this section and those standards for parking lot
design, landscaping and lighting.

(2) Missing.
A. Application. All applicants shall submit the information necessary for
the Township to consider whether an application is an eligible facilities
request, as set forth in Section 16.71.030. The applicant will not be
required to demonstrate a need or business case for the proposed
modification.
B. Type of Review. Upon receipt of an application for an eligible facilities
request pursuant to this chapter, the Township Engineer shall review
such application to determine whether the application so qualifies.
C. Time Frame for Review. Within 60 days of the date on which an
applicant submits an application seeking approval under this chapter,
the Township Engineer shall approve the application with or without
conditions unless the Township Engineer determines that the
application is not covered by this chapter, in which case the Township
Engineer shall deny the application.
D. Tolling of the Time Frame for Review. The sixty-day review period
begins to run when the application is filed, and may be tolled only by
mutual agreement by the Township of Raritan and the applicant, or in
cases where the Township Engineer determines that the application is
incomplete.
1. To toll the time frame for incompleteness, the Township Engineer
must provide written notice to the applicant within 30 days of
receipt of the application, specifically delineating all missing
documents or information required in the application.

§ 16.71.030. Eligible Facilities Request Application Requirements.
[Adopted 5-21-2019 by Ord. No. 19-08]
An eligible facilities request application shall include the following:
2. The time frame for review begins running again when the applicant
makes a supplemental submission in response to the Township
Engineer's notice of incompleteness.
3. Following a supplemental submission, the Township Engineer will
notify the applicant within 10 days that the supplemental
submission did not provide the information identified in the original
notice delineating missing information. The time frame is tolled in
the case of second or subsequent notices pursuant to the
procedures identified in this section. Second or subsequent notices
of incompleteness may not specify missing documents or
information that were not delineated in the original notice of
incompleteness.
E. Not a Covered Request. If the Township Engineer determines that the
applicant's request for collocation is a "substantial change" to
collocation on an existing structure, as defined in this Title, the
presumptively reasonable time frame, as prescribed by the Federal
Communications Commission's shot clock order, will begin to run from
the issuance of the Township Engineer's decision that the application is
not a covered request. To the extent such information is necessary, the
Township Engineer may request additional information from the
applicant to evaluate the application. When the Township Engineer
determines that such an application constitutes a substantial change,
applicable portions of this chapter and the Raritan Township
Ordinances must be complied with, including but not limited to the
requirement for site plan review and application for variances.
F. Failure to Act. In the event the Township Engineer fails to approve or
deny a request seeking approval under this chapter within the time
frame for review (accounting for any tolling), the request shall be
deemed granted. The deemed grant does not become effective until the
applicant notifies the Township of Raritan in writing after the review
period has expired (accounting for any tolling) that the application has
been deemed granted.
G. Remedies. Applicants and the Township of Raritan or its agents may
bring claims related to this chapter to any court of competent
jurisdiction.
A. The applicant's certification that they have the legal authority to
collocate/modify a support structure which may include approvals from
the jurisdiction authorizing the initial placement of transmission
equipment on the tower or other structure.

exterior. Said sign shall be a wall sign and shall be placed
immediately adjacent to the private external entrance and shall
not exceed six square feet. Prime tenants shall be permitted a

Planner shall not review, act upon, or consider any plan until
such time as the initial fees and escrows are paid in full.
d. Sketch site plan: $500.
5. The obligor shall reimburse the Township for all reasonable
inspection fees paid to the Engineer providing inspection of
improvements. The obligor shall pay to the Township a deposit for
the inspection fees in an amount not to exceed, except for
extraordinary circumstances, the greater of $500 or 5% of the cost
of improvements, which cost shall be determined as follows:
The cost of the installation of improvements shall be estimated by
the Township Engineer based on documented construction costs
of public improvements prevailing in the general area of the
municipality. The developer may appeal the Township Engineer's
estimate to the Governing Body. The Governing Body shall decide
the appeal within 45 days of receipt of the appeal in writing by the
Municipal Clerk. After the developer posts a guarantee with the
Township based on the cost of the installation of improvements as
determined by the Governing Body, he or she may institute legal
action within one year of the posting in order to preserve the right
to a judicial determination as to the fairness and reasonableness of
the amount of the guarantee.
For those developments for which the reasonably anticipated fees
are less than $10,000, fees may, at the option of the developer,
be paid in two installments. The initial amount deposited by a
developer shall be 50% of the reasonably anticipated fees. When
the balance on deposit drops to 10% of the reasonably anticipated
fees because the amount deposited by the developer has been
reduced by the amount paid to the engineer for inspection, the
developer shall deposit the remaining 50% of the anticipated
inspection fees. For those developments for which the reasonably
anticipated fees are $10,000 or greater, fees may, at the option
of the developer, be paid in four installments. The initial amount
deposited by a developer shall be 25% of the reasonably
anticipated fees. When the balance on deposit drops to 10% of the
reasonably anticipated fees because the amount deposited by the
developer has been reduced by the amount paid to the engineer for
inspection, the developer shall make additional deposits of 25% of
§ 16.78.050 CODE ADOPTION § 16.78.050
1.01:791
the reasonably anticipated fees. The engineer shall not perform any
inspection if sufficient funds to pay for those inspections are not on
deposit.
6. The payment of the required escrow amounts shall not relieve an
applicant of the responsibility for payment of required inspection
fees as provided in the development ordinance.
7. The Township Finance Officer shall monthly advise the
Administrative Officer of the balance of all escrow accounts and
whether additional funds are required as provided hereinafter. In
the event additional funds are required, it shall be the obligation of
the Administrative Officer to notify the applicant of the additional
escrow amounts required, and in the event there is a refusal or
failure to make the payments required, the Administrative Officer
shall notify the approving authority. In the event the additional fees
are not paid, the Planning Board, Board of Adjustment or Township
professionals and consultants shall take no further action on the
application until such time as the additional fees have been paid.
8. Replenishment of Escrow Balance. The escrow associated with
each application shall be replenished whenever the original escrow
is reduced by charges against the account to 35% or less of the
original amount. The Administrative Officer shall notify the
applicant of the requirement to replenish the escrow, and the
applicant shall be requested to deposit an amount to bring the
balance up to 50% of the original escrow amount. No further
building permits or certificate of occupancies shall be issued, and
no further consideration, review, processing, or inspection shall be
performed until the additional escrow has been paid.
9. Accounting of Fees. In the event any applicant desires an account
of the expense or fees paid by him or her for professional review, he
or she shall request such in a letter directed to the Administrative
Officer. The applicant shall be responsible for any costs incurred by
the Township in having its professional and administrative staff
prepare an accounting of the fees expended.
10. Use and Return of Escrow Balance.
a. The Township Engineer, Township Planner, or Approving
Agency Attorney and any other professional engaged by the
Board as experts in connection with the application shall
submit vouchers for all fees for consultation examination,
review or testimony, to the Approving Agency for approval
after which the bill shall be forwarded to the Township and
shall be paid from the escrow account.
b. If any money deposited in the escrow account is unexpended
upon completion of the project and the satisfactory completion
of the maintenance period, if any, or phased section in the case
of a sectionalized application, the amount shall be returned to
§ 16.78.050 RARITAN CODE § 16.78.050
1.01:792
the applicant or, at the developer's request, applied to the next
phase.
11. Whenever an amount of money in excess of $5,000 shall be
deposited by an applicant with the Township for professional
services employed by the Township to review applications for
development, the money, until repaid or applied to the purposes for
which it is deposited, including the applicant's portion of the
interest earned thereon, except as otherwise provided in this
chapter, shall continue to be the property of the applicant and shall
be held in trust by the Township. Money deposited shall be held in
escrow. The Township shall deposit it in a banking institution or
savings and loan association in this state insured by an agency of
the federal government, or in any other fund or depository
approved for such deposits by the state, in an account bearing
interest at the minimum rate currently paid by the institution or
depository on time or savings deposits. The Township shall notify
the applicant in writing of the name and address of the institution
or depository in which the deposit is made and the amount of the
deposit. The Township shall not be required to refund an amount of
interest paid on a deposit which does not exceed $100 for the year.
If the amount of interest exceeds $100, that entire amount shall
belong to the applicant and shall be refunded to him by the
Township annually or at the time the deposit is repaid or applied to
the purposes for which it was deposited, as the case may be; except
that the Township may retain for administrative expenses a sum
equivalent to no more than 33 1/3% of that entire amount which
shall be in lieu of all other administrative and custodial expenses.
12. Special Cases. When the Planning Board or Board of Adjustment
decides that a traffic engineering review of a development is
necessary, then such funds for such traffic engineering study,
consultation, review and/or testimony shall be in addition to the
escrow fees above specified. Other specialist which are necessary
to review and make recommendations on a development including
but not limited to geologist, hydrologist, landscape architect,
architect shall be treated in the same manner as the traffic
engineer.
13. Requests for Rezoning. The initial required escrow amount
concerning a request for rezoning, being a requested change of
zoning map designations shall be $4,000. [Amended by Ord.
06-14 § 13]
14. Informal Review of a Development. When an applicant submits an
application for informal review, it shall be the applicant's option to
request professional review of the development by executing an
escrow agreement to cover the necessary and reasonable costs
incurred by the Approving Agency.
The following escrows shall apply:

directions to issue permits under N.J.S.A. 40:55D-76 is permitted.
15. Pre-application Meeting. A property owner or applicant may
request a meeting with Township professionals prior to submitting
a formal application for development. The fees for such
consultation or review shall be chargeable to the applicant's
escrow account following his or her submission of a formal
application and required escrow fees.
16. Conformity with Statutes and Prior Ordinances. With the adoption
of the Municipal Land Use Law, L.1975 c.291, specifically, N.J.S.A.
40:55D-53.1, Deposits with Municipality; Escrow; Interest,
effective August 28, 1985, all amounts paid by applicants for review

accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.1, and any
excess amounts remaining in the account upon full completion of
the project, as evidenced by a resolution of release by the Township
Committee based upon a recommendation of the Township
Engineer and Chief Financial Officer, shall be returned to the
applicant. If the outstanding professional fees exceed the
remaining escrow amount, the applicant shall pay all such fees
prior to consideration by the Township Committee of any resolution
of final approval or release of the cash deposits, bonds or other
sureties posted by the applicant.
Any funds paid by an applicant for professional review or
inspections prior to August 28, 1985, and in accordance with the
existing ordinances of Raritan Township, were paid as flat-rate
fees for those services based upon the flat-rate fee schedule in
effect, and without relation to the actual costs, more or less, of the
services provided.

1.01:807
A. Design and Performance Standards for Stormwater Management
Measures.
1. Stormwater management measures for major development shall be
designed to meet the erosion control, ground water recharge, and
stormwater runoff quantity and quality standards in Section
16.84.030, as described in technical guidance documents listed in
Section 16.84.060. As detailed in 16.84.030, to the maximum
extent practicable, these standards shall be met by incorporating
nonstructural stormwater management strategies into the design.
If these strategies alone are not sufficient to meet these standards,
structural stormwater management measures necessary to meet
these standards shall be incorporated into the design. If these
strategies alone are not sufficient to meet these standards,
structural stormwater management measures necessary to meet
these standards shall be incorporated into the design along with
the practicable nonstructural strategies, and/or off site mitigation
measures.
2. The standards in this chapter apply to both new major development
and redevelopment and are intended to minimize the impact of
stormwater runoff on water quality and water quantity in receiving
water bodies and maintain ground water recharge. The standards
do not apply to major development to the extent that alternative
design and performance standards are applicable under a regional
stormwater management plan or Water Quality Management Plan
adopted in accordance with Department rules.
B. Stormwater Management Requirements for Major Development.
1. Nonstructural Stormwater Management Strategies. To the
maximum extent practicable, the standards in Sections
16.84.030.B and C shall be met by incorporating nonstructural
stormwater management strategies set forth in this subsection into
the design. The applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures
incorporated into the design of the project. Documentation of the
use of nonstructural stormwater management measures shall
require the preparation by the applicant of the N.J.D.E.P. Low
Impact Development checklist. If the applicant contends that it is
not feasible for engineering, environmental, or safety reasons to
incorporate any or only specific nonstructural stormwater
management measures identified in Section 16.84.030.B.2 below
into the design of a particular project, the applicant shall identify
the strategy or strategies considered and provide a basis for the
contention. In both cases, the applicant bears the burden of
proving any impracticability. If the Board finds that, the applicant
has not provided stormwater management strategies to the
maximum extent practicable then the application shall be deemed
to be in violation of the stormwater management regulations.
§ 16.84.030 RARITAN CODE § 16.84.030
1.01:808
2. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated
into site design shall:

to post construction;
e. Minimize land clearing and disturbance and overall site
grading;
f. Minimize soil compaction;
g. Retain native, non-invasive vegetation, plant low-maintenance
landscaping, plant native vegetation, and minimize the
creation of lawns and the use of plantings and vegetation that
require the excessive use of fertilizers, pesticides and
irrigation;
h. Provide vegetated open-channel conveyance systems
discharging into and through stable vegetated areas;
i. Provide other source controls to prevent or minimize the use,
exposure and/or mobilization of pollutants and prevent or
minimize the release and transport of those pollutants into
stormwater runoff. Such source controls include, but are not
limited to:
j. Site design features that help to prevent accumulation of trash
and debris in drainage systems, including features that satisfy
Section 16.84.030.B.3 below;
k. Site design features that help to prevent discharge of trash and
debris from drainage systems;
l. Site design features that help to prevent and/or contain spills
or other harmful accumulations of pollutants at industrial or
commercial developments; and
m. When establishing vegetation after land disturbance,
application fertilizer in accordance with the requirements
established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act,
N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and implementing rules. Prior to
§ 16.84.030 CODE ADOPTION § 16.84.030
1.01:809
applying fertilizer, soil tests must be conducted onsite to
determine the type of fertilization necessary.
3. Site design features identified under Section 16.84.030.B.2 above

bicycle safe grate, which is described in Chapter 2.4 of the
NJDOT Bicycle Compatible Roadways and Bikeways Planning
and Design Guidelines (April 1996); or
c. A different grate, if each individual clear space in that grate
has an area of no more than seven (7.0) square inches, or is no
greater than 0.5 inches across the smallest dimension.
d. Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear
space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if
the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an
area of no more than seven square inches, or be no greater
than two inches across the smallest dimension.
e. This standard does not apply:
i. Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
ii. Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in 16.84.030.C.1 are conveyed through any
device (e.g., end of pipe netting facility, manufactured
treatment device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed,
at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
(A) A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches
wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities); or
(B) A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inches.
(C) Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that
has parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the
bars, to the elevation of the water quality design storm
as specified in Section 16.84.030.C.1; or
§ 16.84.030 RARITAN CODE § 16.84.030
1.01:810

meet this standard is an undertaking that constitutes
an encroachment or will damage or destroy a
structure or site listed or determined to be eligible to
be listed on the National Register for Historic Places
as listed within the Township Historical Survey,
Hunterdon County Historical Survey, The New Jersey
Register of Historical Places or the National Register
of Historic Places or as may be further recommended
by the Raritan Township Local Historians Committee.

engineer shall comply with at least one of the following
standards:
(A) Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the post-developed project site maintains
100% of the site's pre-developed average annual
ground water recharge volume; or
(B) Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that any increase in the project site's
projected stormwater runoff volume produced by the
two-Year, twenty-four-hour storm from pre-developed
to post-developed conditions is fully infiltrated.
ii. Ground water recharge is not required at major
development projects located within an "urban
redevelopment area" as defined in Section 16.84.020 or
from those portions of major development projects that
produce stormwater runoff described in Subsection
C.I.b.iii. below.
iii. The following two types of stormwater runoff shall not be
recharged:
(A) Stormwater runoff from areas of high pollutant
loading. High pollutant loading areas are: 1) areas in
industrial and commercial developments where
solvents and/or petroleum products are loaded/
unloaded, stored, or applied; 2) areas where
pesticides are loaded/unloaded or stored; 3) areas
where hazardous materials are expected to be present
in greater than "reportable quantities" as defined by
the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) at 40 CFR 302.4; and 4) areas where recharge
would be inconsistent with a Department approved
remedial action work plan or landfill closure plan and
areas with high risks for spills of toxic materials, such
as gas stations and vehicle maintenance facilities; and
(B) Stormwater runoff from industrial areas exposed to
"source material".
iv. The design engineer shall assess and certify the hydraulic
impact on the ground water table and design the project
site and all site ground water recharge measures so as to
avoid adverse hydraulic impacts. Adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, raising the ground
§ 16.84.030 RARITAN CODE § 16.84.030
1.01:812
water table so as to cause surface ponding, flooding of
basements and other subsurface facilities, and
interference with the proper operation of subsurface
sewage disposal systems and other subsurface structures
in the vicinity of a ground water recharge measure.
c. The minimum design and performance standards for the
control of stormwater runoff quantity are as follows:
i. Using the criteria for calculating stormwater runoff and
ground water recharge in Section 16.84.040, the design
engineer shall comply with at least one of the following
standards:
(A) Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the post-developed stormwater runoff
hydrographs from the project site for the two-, ten-,
and 100-Year storms do not exceed, at any point in
time, the site's pre-developed runoff hydrographs for
the same storms;
(B) Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that under post-developed site conditions: 1)
there is no increase in pre-developed stormwater
runoff rates from the project site for the two-, ten-, and
100-Year storms; and 2) any increased stormwater
runoff volume or change in stormwater runoff timing
for these storms will not increase flood damage at or
downstream of the project site. When performing this
analysis for pre-developed site conditions, all off-site
development levels shall reflect existing conditions.
When performing this analysis for post-developed site
conditions, all off-site development levels shall reflect
full development in accordance with current zoning
and land use ordinances.
(C) Design onsite stormwater management measures so
that the peak post-developed stormwater runoff rates
from the project site for the two-, ten- and 100-Year
storms are 50, 75 and 80%, respectively, of the site's
peak pre-developed stormwater runoff rates. Peak
stormwater outflow rates for these storms shall be
adjusted where necessary to account for the discharge
of increased stormwater runoff rates and/or volumes
from project site areas not controlled by the onsite
measures. The percentages do not have to be applied
to those portions of the project site that are not
proposed for development at the time of application
provided that such areas are: 1) protected from future
development by conservation easement, deed
restriction, or other acceptable legal measures or 2)
§ 16.84.030 CODE ADOPTION § 16.84.030
1.01:813
would be subject to review under these standards if
they are proposed for any degree of development in
the future.
2. Any application for a new agricultural or horticultural development
that meets the definition of major development in Section
16.84.020 shall be submitted to the appropriate Soil Conservation
District for review and approval in accordance with the
requirements of this section and any applicable Soil Conservation
District guidelines for stormwater runoff quantity and erosion
control.
D. Stormwater Runoff Quality Standards.
1. Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce by
80% the anticipated post-construction load of total suspended
solids (TSS) in stormwater runoff from the developed site,
expressed as pounds per year. Stormwater management measures
shall only be required for water quality control if an additional 1/4
acre or more of impervious surface is being proposed on a
development site. The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to
any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric
effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in
a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this
requirement. Daily limits of TSS (TMDL) may apply to the site
development based on conditions of regulatory approvals.
2. The water quality design storm shall be 1.25 inches of rainfall in
two hours. Water quality calculations shall take into account the
distribution of rain from the water quality design storm, as
reflected in Table 1, subject to revision due to subsequent rule
changes. The calculation of the volume of runoff may take into
account the implementation of non-structural and structural
stormwater management measures.

3. For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 presents the
presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed, constructed
and maintained in accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater
Best Management Practices Manual, subject to revision due to
subsequent rule changes. The current edition of the BMP Manual
may be obtained from the address identified in Section 16.84.060,
or found on the Department's website at www.njstormwater.org.
The BMP Manual and other sources of technical guidance are listed
in Section 16.84.060. TSS reduction shall be calculated based on
the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2. Alternative BMPs,
removal rates and methods of calculating removal rates may be
approved if the design engineer provides documentation
demonstrating the capability of these alternative BMPs, removal
rates and computational methods to the review agency.
Documentation for alternative rates and methods shall consist of
published (peer-reviewed) journal article or scientific paper. A copy
of any approved alternative rate or method of calculating the
removal rate, including documentation, shall be provided to the
Department at the following address: Division of Watershed
Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, PO Box 418 Trenton, New Jersey, 08625-0418.
4. If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
80% TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize the
following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A+B-(AXB)/100
Where:
R = total TSS percent load removal (expressed as a whole
number) from application of both BMPs, and
A = the TSS percent removal rate (whole number)
applicable to the first (upstream) BMP
B = the TSS percent removal rate (whole number)
applicable to the second (downstream) BMP
In cases where three (or more) BMPs are used in series, the
applicant shall calculate the TSS reduction for the two most
upstream BMps in the series using the above formula, then
substitute the result (R) of that calculation in the formula for "A"
when calculating the combined result with the next BMP in the
series.
5. If there is more than one onsite drainage area, the 80% TSS
removal rate shall apply to the discharge of each drainage subarea,
unless the runoff from the subareas converge on site, in which case
the removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using
an area-weighted average.
§ 16.84.030 RARITAN CODE § 16.84.030
1.01:816
6. Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent practicable, the post-construction
nutrient load from the developed site in stormwater runoff
generated from the water quality design storm. In achieving
reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent practicable, the
design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in Sections 16.84.030.B and
C. This standard may be superseded by a more stringent numeric
effluent limitation imposed under the New Jersey Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in
a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this
requirement. Daily limits for nutrient loading (TMDL) may apply to
the site development based on conditions of regulatory approvals.
7. Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, which may
be obtained from the address identified in Section 16.84.060.
8. In accordance with the definition of FWI at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff and any new stormwater
discharge point to waters classified as FWI.
9. Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and along all
perennial or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the
Category One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps, in
the County Soil Surveys within the associated HUC14 drainage
area, the Municipal Stormwater Management Plan, or a stream
delineation overlay prepared by the Department. These areas shall
be designated and protected as follows:
a. The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following, unless superseded by a local Stream Corridor
Protection Ordinance:
i. A 300-foot special water resource protection area shall be
provided on each side of the waterway, measured
perpendicular to the waterway from the top of the bank
outwards or from the centerline of the waterway where the
bank is not defined, consisting of existing vegetation or
vegetation allowed to follow natural succession.
ii. Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under Subsection D.9.a.i. above
shall only be allowed where previous development or
disturbance has occurred (for example, pre-existing active
agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn area).
The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
§ 16.84.030 CODE ADOPTION § 16.84.030
1.01:817
applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the review
agency that the functional value and overall condition of
the special water resource protection area will be
maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no case
shall the remaining special water resource protection area
be reduced to less than 150 feet as measured
perpendicular to the top of bank of the waterway or
centerline of the waterway where the bank is undefined.
b. All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the Standard for Off-Site Stability in the "Standards for
Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey," established
under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A.
4:24-39 et seq.
c. If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
Standard for Off-Site Stability in the "Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey," established
under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A.
4:24-39 et seq., then the stabilization measures in accordance
with the requirements of the above standards may be placed
within the special water resource protection area, provided
that:
i. Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150 feet
of the Category One waterway;
ii. Stormwater discharges allowed by this section shall
achieve a 95% TSS post-construction removal rate;
iii. Thermal pollution by stormwater discharges shall be
addressed to ensure no significant increase or decrease in
temperature occurs in the receiving waterway outside of
the mixing zone;
iv. The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the review
agency that the ecological value and condition of the
special water resource protection area will be maintained
to the maximum extent practicable;
v. A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
Township staff to identify necessary stabilization
measures; and
vi. All encroachments proposed under this section shall be
reviewed and approved by the Department prior to
approval by the review agency.
§ 16.84.030 RARITAN CODE § 16.84.030
1.01:818
d. A stream corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to
Subsection D.9. shall maintain or enhance the current
ecological value and condition of the special water resource
protection area as defined above. In no case shall a stream
corridor protection plan allow the reduction of the Special
Water Resource Protection Area to less than 150 feet as
measured perpendicular to the waterway subject to this
subsection.
e. Subsection D.9. does not apply to the construction of one
individual single family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development and is on a lot receiving preliminary or final
subdivision approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided
that the construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
E. Maintenance Plan. The development shall incorporate a maintenance
plan for the stormwater management measures incorporated into the
design of a major development in accordance with Section 16.84.090.
F. Exemptions. The following linear development projects are exempt
from the ground water recharge, stormwater runoff quantity, and
stormwater runoff quality requirements of Sections 16.84.030.B and C:
1. The construction of an underground utility line provided that the
disturbed areas are re-vegetated upon completion;
2. The construction of an aboveground utility line provided that the
existing conditions are maintained to the maximum extent
practicable; and
3. The construction of a public pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk
or trail with a maximum width of 14 feet, provided that the access
is constructed of permeable material such as wood chips, unpacked
gravel, or porous pavement.
G. Waivers from Strict Compliance.
1. A waiver from strict compliance with the ground water recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quantity
requirements of Sections 16.84.030.B and C may be obtained for
the enlargement of an existing public roadway or railroad; or the
construction or enlargement of a public pedestrian access,
provided that the following conditions are met:
a. The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the
project that cannot be accomplished by any other means;
b. The applicant demonstrates, through an alternatives analysis
acceptable to the review agency, that through the use of
nonstructural and structural stormwater management
strategies and measures, the option selected complies with the
§ 16.84.030 CODE ADOPTION § 16.84.030
1.01:819
§ 16.84.040. Calculation of Stormwater Runoff and Ground Water
Recharge. [Amended by Ord. 06-11]
requirements of Sections 16.84.030.B and C to the maximum
extent practicable;
c. The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the
requirements of Sections 16.84.030.B and C, existing
structures currently in use, such as homes and buildings,
would need to be condemned; and
d. The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other
rights to areas including the potential to obtain through
condemnation lands not falling under Subsection F.1.c. above
within the upstream drainage area of the receiving stream,
that would provide additional opportunities to mitigate the
requirements of Sections 16.84.030.B and C that were not
achievable on-site.
2. A waiver from strict compliance with the requirements of Sections
16.84.030.B and C may be issued in those cases where an applicant
has demonstrated the inability or impracticality of strict
compliance, other than projects addressed under Subsection F.1,
with the stormwater management requirements set forth in
N.J.A.C.7:8, in an adopted regional stormwater management plan,
or in a local ordinance which is as strict as N.J.A.C. 7:8. A waiver
from strict compliance for such projects can only be obtained if the
applicant agrees to undertake a suitable mitigation measure
identified in the mitigation section of the municipality's Stormwater
Management Plan. In such cases, the applicant must submit a
mitigation plan detailing how the project's failure to strictly comply
will be compensated. In cases where a waiver is granted, an
applicant should provide mitigation, if possible and/or practical
within the same HUC-14 watershed within which the subject
project is proposed, or contribute funding toward a regional
stormwater control project, or provide for equivalent treatment at
an alternate location, or other equivalent water quality benefit, in
lieu of implementing the required stormwater control measures on
their specific site.
H. Threatened and Endangered Species. When habitat for threatened and
endangered species (see definition for Environmental Critical Areas in
Section 16.84.020 is present on a site, stormwater management
measures shall be implemented to avoid adverse impacts caused by
pollutant discharge, the creation of concentrated flow, or the alteration
of recharge.
A. Stormwater Runoff Calculations.
§ 16.84.030 RARITAN CODE § 16.84.040
1.01:820
1. In complying with the design and performance standards in
Sections 16.84.030, the design engineer shall calculate stormwater
runoff using one of the following methods:
a. The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation, NRCS
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, and appropriate NRCS
twenty-four-hour design storm, as described in the current
NRCS National Engineering Handbook Part 630 - Hydrology,
and the current Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for
Small Watersheds or superceding document; or
b. The Rational Method for peak stormwater runoff rate
calculations and the Modified Rational Method for stormwater
runoff hydrograph calculations. Use of the Rational Method
and Modified Rational Method are limited to drainage areas of
20 acres or less. Neither the Rational Method nor Modified
Rational Method shall be used to calculate runoff volumes for
ground water recharge or stormwater runoff infiltration
purposes.
2. When selecting or calculating runoff coefficients for pre-developed
project site conditions using any of the above methods, the project
site's land cover shall be assumed to be woods. However, another
land cover may be used to calculate runoff coefficients if: 1) such
land cover has existed at the site or portion thereof site without
interruption for at least five years immediately prior to the time of
application; and 2) the design engineer can document the
character and extent of such land cover through the use of
photographs, affidavits, and/or other acceptable land use records.
If more than one land cover other than woods has existed on the
site during the five years immediately prior to the time of
application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential
(including woods) shall be used for the computations. All predeveloped
land covers shall be assumed to be in good hydrologic
condition and, if cultivated, shall be assumed to have applied
appropriate conservation practices.
3. In calculating pre-developed site stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall include the effects of all land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows and
culverts, that reduce pre-developed site stormwater runoff rates
and/or volumes.
4. In calculating stormwater runoff using the NRCS methodology, the
design engineer shall use appropriate twenty-four-hour rainfall
depths as developed for the project site by the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.
5. In calculating stormwater runoff using the NRCS methodology, the
design engineer shall separately calculate and then combine the
§ 16.84.040 CODE ADOPTION § 16.84.040
1.01:821
§ 16.84.050. Standards for Structural Stormwater Management
Measures. [Amended by Ord. 06-11]
runoff volumes from pervious and directly connected impervious
surfaces within a drainage area.
6. Calculation of stormwater runoff from unconnected impervious
surfaces shall be based, as applicable, upon the Two-Step
methodology as described in the Department's current Stormwater
Best Management Practices Manual or the NRCS methodology
described in the current Technical Release 55  Urban Hydrology
for Small Watersheds.
B. Ground Water Recharge Calculations.
1. In complying with the design and performance standards in Section
16.84.030, the design engineer may calculate ground water
recharge in accordance with the New Jersey Groundwater
Recharge Spreadsheet (NJGRS) computer program as described in
the Department's current Stormwater Best Management Practices
Manual. Alternative ground water recharge calculation methods
may be used upon approval by the municipal engineer.
2. In complying with the design and performance standards in Section
16.84.030, the design engineer shall calculate stormwater runoff
infiltration volumes in accordance with the USDA Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) methodology, including
the NRCS Runoff Equation, as described in the current NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Part 630  Hydrology and the
current Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds. In addition, the design engineer shall use appropriate
two-Year, twenty-four-hour rainfall depths as developed for the
project site by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
3. When selecting or calculating runoff coefficients for pre-developed
project site conditions for ground water recharge or stormwater
runoff infiltration calculations, the project site's land cover shall be
assumed to be woods. However, another land cover may be used to
calculate runoff coefficients if: 1) such land cover has existed at the
site or portion thereof site without interruption for at least five
years immediately prior to the time of application; and 2) the
design engineer can document the character and extent of such
land cover through the use of photographs, affidavits, and/or other
acceptable land use records. If more than one land cover other than
woods has existed on the site during the five years immediately
prior to the time of application, the land cover with the lowest
runoff potential (including woods) shall be used for the
computations. All pre-developed land covers shall be assumed to be
in good hydrologic condition and, if cultivated, shall be assumed to
have conservation treatment.
§ 16.84.040 RARITAN CODE § 16.84.050
1.01:822
A. Structural Management Measures. Standards for structural
stormwater management measures are as follows:
1. Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
factor into the design the existing site conditions which may cause
the measure to fail, have an adverse effect on water quality or
quantity, or cause harm or damage to persons or property,
including, for example, environmentally critical areas, wetlands;
flood-prone areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high water table; soil
type, permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage
patterns; existing or former mines; significant land filling; and the
presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone) and related
Karst topography.
2. Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and
ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the
intake to the outlet structure as appropriate, and shall have parallel
bars with one-inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of the
water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the water
quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure shall
be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the diameter of the
orifice or 1/3 the width of the weir, with a minimum spacing
between bars of one-inch and a maximum spacing between bars of
six inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must comply with
the requirements of Section 16.84.070.
3. Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosion
resistant. Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions
of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3,
7.4, and 7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement. The
measures are to be sequenced in the site development process so
that erosion control standards are met and so the measure is not
compromised or impaired by construction runoff.
4. At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin,
the orifice size shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 inches in diameter.
5. Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins at
Section 16.84.070.
6. Where tail water will affect the hydraulic performance of a
stormwater management measure, the design engineer shall
include such effects in the measure's design.
B. Guidelines for Management Measures. Stormwater management
measure guidelines are available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual and other documents as described in
Section 16.84.060. Other stormwater management measures may be
utilized provided the design engineer demonstrates to the satisfaction
§ 16.84.050 CODE ADOPTION § 16.84.050
1.01:823
§ 16.84.060. Sources for Technical Guidance. [Amended by Ord.
06-11]
of the review agency that the proposed measure and its design will
accomplish the required water quantity, ground water recharge and
water quality design and performance standards established by Section
16.84.030 of this ordinance.
C. Manufactured Treatment Devices.
1. Manufactured treatment devices may be used to meet the
requirements of Section 16.84.030 of this chapter, provided the
pollutant removal rates are verified by the New Jersey Corporation
for Advanced Technology and certified by the Department.
2. Non-verified manufactured treatment devices may also be used for
purposes other than underground discharge of stormwater, where
such devices provide a clear benefit to stormwater quality or flow
control in a manner that facilitates improved nonstructural
stormwater management controls on the site, or avoids the need
for approval of off-site mitigation. The benefits of proposed nonverified
manufactured treatment devices must be proved to the
satisfaction of the review agency.
3. Manufactured treatment devices may be used only where the
maintenance plan required by Section 16.84.090 ensures that the
manufactured device will be properly maintained for its functional
lifespan and will be replaced as needed with management
measures that are at least as effective as the original manufactured
treatment device working in accordance with manufacturers
specifications.

§ 16.85.020. Specific Floodplain Requirements. [Prior code
§ 15-11.6; amended by Ord. 06-11]
A. Preservation of Natural Land. It is found that natural floodplains,
periodic flooding, soils, vegetation, fish and wildlife and that periodic
flooding of lowland areas, marshes and swamps adjacent to stream
channels produces a rich physical-chemical environment for may living
organisms. It is further found that floodplains contain biological
communities which are among the most productive of natural systems
and perform the following essential to the natural environment:
1. Passage and storage of storm floodwaters;
2. Removal of sediment loads from streams through deposition;
3. Replenishment of groundwater supplies through soil infiltration;
4. Dissipation of energy of flood flows, thereby reducing downstream
destruction;
5. Provide areas of recreational and aesthetic pleasure.
Because of the importance of the natural floodplain as cited above, all
natural land within any delineated floodplain shall be preserved in its
natural state and, where possible, developed land within the floodplain
shall be restored to its natural state so as to duplicate the natural or
undeveloped drainage characteristics in terms of runoff and velocity.
B. Permitted Uses in Channels, Floodplains and Floodplain (500 year)
Areas.
1. Channel. Within any channel, structures may be erected, enlarged,
expanded or externally altered and fill, excavation or other
improvements or changes may be permitted only in connection
with stream improvement or stabilization, which improvements or
changer shall have the specific approval of the State Department of
Environmental Protection and the Township Planning Board. The
Hunterdon County Planning Board shall receive copies of all
exhibits for their review and approval as required.
2. Floodplain. Within any floodplain, structure may be erected,
enlarged, expanded or externally altered, and fill, excavation or
other improvement or changes may be permitted only in
connection with stream improvement or stabilization, which
improvements or changes shall have the specific approval of the
State Department of Environmental Protection and the Township
Planning Board. The Hunterdon County Planning Board shall
receive copies of all exhibits for their review and approval as
required.
The accepted practices of soil husbandry and farming, as well as
recreational uses in the nature of parks, playgrounds, picnic areas,
golf course, and boat landings shall be permitted in accordance
§ 16.85.020 RARITAN CODE § 16.85.020
1.01:836
with the issuance of a permit as provided by Section 16.84.050.B.
No material, equipment or vehicles shall be parked or stored in the
floodway even in conjunction with a permitted use.
3. Floodplain (500 year) Areas. Until a floodplain (500 year) has been
designated by the Department, the requirements for the floodplain,
Subsection C.2. of this section, shall apply to the floodplain (500)
area.
Once a floodplain has been designated, structures may be
constructed, erected, enlarged, expanded, externally altered or
modified and fill, excavation and other improvements may be
permitted in the floodplain (500 year) area only after receiving
specific approval of the Township Planning Board a use allowed by
the zoning chapter and further subject to the conditions set forth in
this Title.
C. Prohibited Uses in Channels, Floodways and Flood Fringe Areas. No
person shall hereafter engage in, cause, or permit other persons to
engage in prohibited uses within a delineated floodplain. The following
uses shall be prohibited:
1. Placing, depositing, or dumping any fill, solid waste, garbage,
refuse, trash, rubbish or debris;
2. Dumping or discharging untreated domestic sewerage or industrial
wastes, either solid or liquid;
3. The storage or disposal of pesticides or of chemical soil nutrients;
4. The storage or processing of materials that are in time of flooding
buoyant, flammable or explosive;
5. The storage or processing of hazardous materials.
D. Pre-existing Nonconforming Structures and Uses.
1. Structures or land uses in any floodplain which existed on or before
April 28, 1975, may be permitted to continue subject to the
following conditions:
a. If any pre-existing structure is destroyed by any means,
including floods, to an extent of 50% or more of its replacement
cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed, except
in conformity with the provisions of this Title;
b. No pre-existing structure shall be moved, altered, expanded,
changed or enlarged unless the provision of this Title are
complied with. This provision does not apply to routine
maintenance and repair, provided that such maintenance and
repair does not increase the flood damage potential of the
structure.

1.01:837
§ 16.85.030. Application Procedures for Building Permit. [Amended
by Ord. 06-11]
In any portion of the floodplain, an existing nonconforming use
or structure may be altered or expanded provided that such
alteration or expansion does not increase its ground coverage
or flood damage potential.
2. Structures in the floodplain, vacant or unused, for six consecutive
months or longer shall not qualify as pre-existing uses. This
subsection shall not apply to structures for rent or sale.
A. Notice of Hearing  Review by Planning Board.
1. Notice of Hearing. Upon application for a development in the
floodplain, a public hearing shall be held by the Planning Board in
