PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Roswell, New mexico. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1962 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

    The (index or indexes) (has or have) been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the (index itself or indexes themselves) which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

    Prior to the commencement of operations, the prospective operator will be required to enter into a written agreement with the city, which agreement will recite the terms and conditions under which he will operate his business on the airport, including, but not limited to, the term of agreement; the rentals, fees, and charges; the rights, privileges and obligations of the respective parties; and other relevant covenants. It should be understood, therefore, that neither the conditions herein contained nor those set forth in this article represent a complete recitation of the provisions to be included in the written agreement. Such contract provisions, however, will not change or modify the minimum standards and requirements, or be inconsistent therewith. 
(Code 1984 § 6-55) 
Sec. 5-56. - Site development standards. 
(a)  The following provisions shall apply to physical facilities: 
(1)  The minimum space required shall be negotiated with the city. 
(2)  The operator shall provide a paved walkway within the leased area to accommodate pedestrian access to the operators office; a paved aircraft apron within the leased area sufficient to accommodate his activities and operations, and telephone facilities for customer use. Floor space allotments shall include office, customer lounge, and restroom facilities, all properly heated and lighted. 
(3)  For construction of any new facilities not already contained on the airport, the operator may be subject to the same standards of development as are contained in the Airport Master Plan for the Roswell Industrial Air Center. 
(b)  The provisions shall apply to personnel: 
(1)  The operator shall have in his employ, and on duty during the required operating hours, trained personnel in such numbers as are required to meet the minimum standards and requirements set forth in an efficient manner for each aeronautical service being performed. The operator shall also provide a responsible person in the office to supervise the operations in the leased area on the airport and with authorization to represent and act for, and on behalf of, the operator during all business hours. 
(2)  All personnel hereinafter required to hold Federal Aviation Administration certificates and ratings shall maintain such certificates and ratings. 
(c)  The provisions shall apply to all commercial and noncommercial aviation facilities: 
(1)  Prior to the construction of any noncommercial aviation facilities on the Roswell Industrial Air Center it must be shown that existing operators are unable or unwilling to provide the service for which the proposed facility is intended. 
(2)  Commercial aviation activities of any kind, including but not limited to aircraft maintenance, flight instruction, charter or aircraft sales shall not be permitted in any noncommercial building or area of the Roswell Industrial Air Center. Notwithstanding the prohibitions of this paragraph, owners of aircraft shall be allowed to maintain their own equipment within the limits of area restrictions. 
(Code 1984 § 6-56) 
Sec. 5-57. - Insurance. 
(a)  The operator shall procure and maintain, during the term of his agreement, insurance of the types and in the minimum limits set forth in the schedule of minimum standards for the respective categories of aeronautical services. The insurance company writing the required policy shall be licensed to do business in the state. 
(b)  Where more than one aeronautical service is proposed, the minimum limits will vary (dependent upon the nature of individual services in such combination) but will not necessarily be cumulative in all instances. For example, if three activities are chosen, it would not be necessary for the operator to carry insurance policies providing the aggregate or combined total of the minimum limits for each type of operation; however, if one of the selected activities required passenger liability coverage or hangar keepers liability not required in either of the other two categories, the operator would be required to provide insurance on the applicable exposures. As a further example, the minimum limit for property damage on a combination of activities would be the highest minimum limit stated in the grouping chosen. Because of these variables, the applicable minimum insurance coverage on combinations of services will be discussed with the prospective operator at the time of his application or otherwise during lease negotiations. 
(c)  All insurance, which the operator is required by the city to carry and keep in force shall include the city, and the officers and agents as additional named insured. The operator shall furnish evidence of his compliance with this requirement to the city's airport manager with proper certification that such insurance is in force and will furnish additional certification as evidence of changes in insurance not less than ten days prior to any such change, if the change results in a reduction in coverages, and not more than five days after such change if the change results in an increase in coverages. 
(d)  The applicable insurance coverages shall be in force during the period of any construction of the operators facilities and/or prior to his entry upon the airport for the conduct of his business. 
(Code 1984 § 6-57) 
Sec. 5-58. - Motor vehicles on airport. 
(a)  The operator will make provisions for the boarding or loading of pilots and passengers of transient general aviation aircraft (using the operator's facilities and services and in the conduct of the operator's business) to and from the operator's office to the operator's aircraft tie-down areas, and the city's airport terminal areas. The operator performing this service with motor vehicles driven on the airport proper shall do so only in strict accordance with airport rules and regulations, applicable federal, state and municipal laws, ordinances, codes, or other similar regulatory measures now in existence or as may be hereafter modified or amended. The operator shall be required to equip these motor vehicles with two-way radio capable of communicating with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Control Tower and must comply strictly with the orders and instructions by radio, light signal, or other communications which may prevail from the FAA Air Traffic Control Tower (where applicable).

The operator further agrees to comply with such enforcement procedures as the United States might demand that the city take in order to comply with the sponsor's assurances. 
(2)  Aircraft service by owner or operator of aircraft. No right or privilege granted herein shall operate to prevent any person or persons, firm, or corporation operating aircraft on the airport from performing any services on its own aircraft with its own regular employees (including, but not limited to, maintenance and repair) that it may choose to perform. 
(3)  Nonexclusive rights. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to grant or otherwise authorize the granting of an exclusive right. 
(4)  City's rights. The city reserves the right (but not an obligation) to maintain the landing area and all publicly-owned facilities of the airport; the city also reserves the right to direct and control the maintenance activities of all lessees of airport property in this regard. 
(5)  War or national emergency. During the time of war or national emergency, the city shall have the right to lease the landing area or any part thereof to the United States government for military or naval use and, if such lease is executed, the provisions of this instrument insofar as they are inconsistent with the provisions of the lease to the government, shall be suspended or modified in whatever manner is appropriate to the situation. 
(6)  Airport obstructions. The city reserves the right to take any action it considers necessary to protect the aerial approaches of the airport against obstruction, together with the right to prevent the operator from erecting, or permitting to be erected, any building or other structure on the airport which, in the opinion of the city, would limit the usefulness of the airport or constitute a hazard to aircraft. 
(7)  Subordination. This lease shall be subordinate to the provisions of any existing or future agreement between the city and the United States, relative to the operation or maintenance of the airport, the execution of which has been or may be required as a condition precedent to the expenditure of federal funds for the development of the airport. 
(8)  Compliance with laws, etc. The operator shall at all times comply with the airport rules and regulations, federal, state, and municipal laws, ordinances, codes, and other regulatory measures now in existence or, as may be hereafter modified or amended, applicable to the specific types of operation contemplated by him. The operator shall procure and maintain during the term of the agreement all licenses, permits, and other similar authorizations required for the conduct of his business operations. 
(9)  Indemnity. The operator shall hold the city, the governing body, the airport committee, the airport manager, and the officers, agents and employees of the city harmless from and against all suits, claims, demands, actions, and/or causes of action of any kind or nature in any way arising out of or resulting from, his tenancy and activities, and shall pay all expenses in defending any claims against the city by reason of his tenancy and activities. 
(10)  Misrepresentation. All terms and conditions with respect to this lease are expressly contained herein, and the operator agrees that no representative or agent of the city has made any representation or promise with respect to this lease not expressly contained herein.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 11-6. - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the State of New Mexico has, in NMSA 1978, § 3-18-7, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. 
(Code 1984 § 10-16) 
Sec. 11-7. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of Roswell, New Mexico are subject to periodic inundation which results in the loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands, because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Code 1984 § 10-17) 
Sec. 11-8. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize the expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood-blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

DIVISION 2. - DEFINITIONS 

Sec. 11-16. - Definitions generally. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application: 
    Alluvial fan flooding means flooding occurring on the surface of a alluvial fan or similar land form which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
    Apex means a point on a alluvial fan or similar land form below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this article or a request for a variance. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO, AH or VO zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one-percent chance or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After detailed rate-making has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V 1-30, VE or V. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    Development means any manmade change in improved and unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating or drilling operations. 
    Elevated building means for insurance purposes, a nonbasement building, which has its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, piers, pilings or columns. 
    Existing construction means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads.) 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated the boundaries of the flood and mudslide- (i.e., mudflow) related erosion areas having special hazards and which have been designated as Zone A, M and or E. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the flood hazard boundary map. 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of "flooding"). 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Flood protection system means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood-modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
    Floodproofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce to eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    Floodway (regulatory floodway) means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of flood plain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair facilities but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historical structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or 
(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or; 
b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    Levee means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations. 
    Manufactured home means a structure transportable in one (1) or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes, the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days. For insurance purposes, the term "manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles. 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1988 or other datum to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
    New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installations of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Recreation vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Public Law 97-348)) includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued; provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Variance is a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this article when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. (For full requirements, see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations). 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certification or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4) or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  Showing a good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(k)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that: 
(1)  The criteria outlined in section 11-34(a) through (i) are met; and 
(2)  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

DIVISION 5. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 11-41. - General standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required for all new construction and substantial improvements: 
(1)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
(2)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
(3)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; 
(4)  All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
(5)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate the infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
(6)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate the infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and 
(7)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(Code 1984 § 10-48) 
Sec. 11-42. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have been provided, as set forth in sections 11-31, 11-32(8) and 11-43(d), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection, as proposed in subsection 11-33(a)(1), is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice, as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification, which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed, shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(4)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zone A shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist floatation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, the use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
b.  Require that all manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AR and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: 
1.  Outside of a manufactured home park of subdivision; 
2.  In a new manufactured park or subdivision; 
3.  In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or 
4.  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with zones A1-30, AH, AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (4) of this section be elevated so either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation; or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(5)  Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either: 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
b.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or 
c.  Meet the permit requirements of article IV, section 11-33(a), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in subsection (4) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.

Sec. 11-43. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(a)  All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall be consistent with sections 11-7 through 11-9 of this article. 
(b)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall meet the development permit requirements of sections 11-23 and 11-37 and the provisions of this division. 
(c)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section 11-22 or section 11-36(8) of this article. 
(d)  All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(e)  All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, shall have public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.

Sec. 11-44. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard, established is section 11-22, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in the feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures; 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads or the effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in section 11-33(a)(2), are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within zones AH or AO adequate paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from the proposed structures. 
(Code 1984 § 10-51; Ord. No. 1320, 4-1999) 
Sec. 11-45. - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard, established in section 11-22, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development, unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided, demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If section 11-23(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division. 
(3)  Under the provision of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA. 
(Code 1984 § 10-52; Ord. No. 1320, 4-1999; Ord. No. 03-01, 3-2003) 
Sec. 11-46. - Penalties for noncompliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this ordinance by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this ordinance or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $500.00 or imprisoned for not more than five days, or both for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Roswell from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

(Code 1984 § 31-99; Ord. No. 1223, § 14, 11-1992) 
Sec. 26-80. - Cost recovery system. 
(a)  The city shall take necessary steps to establish a rate schedule for sewer service that assures an equitable system of cost recovery. The purpose hereof is that the industrial users shall pay for the costs incurred by the city in the construction, operation and maintenance of that portion of the POTW related to industrial wastes. 
(b)  The cost recovery system shall satisfy the following conditions: 
(1)  The apportionment of costs must take into consideration the individual industrial user's contribution as related to the total waste load taking into account the volume and strength of all discharges. 
(2)  The costs to be considered should include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Amortization of the applicant's indebtedness for the cost of the treatment works (plant and interceptors); 
b.  Operation and maintenance of the treatment works; 
c.  Fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the pretreatment program; 
d.  Fees for monitoring, inspections and surveillance procedures; 
e.  Fees for reviewing accidental discharge procedures and construction; 
f.  Fees for filing appeals; 
g.  Fees for consistent removal by the POTW of pollutants otherwise subject to federal pretreatment standards; 
h.  Fees for permit applications; 
i.  Other fees as the director may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein. 
(3)  Substantial prepayment of the capital investment or other financial commitments will be required from each industry that contributes 30 percent or more of the total volume or strength of the waste load to be treated by the project. 
(c)  The following cost recovery system is hereby adopted. The system is based on a basic rate for wastes, which do not exceed the concentration of "normal" domestic sewage (with respect to BOD and SS), plus a surcharge for wastes which exceed the concentration of "normal" sewage. The industrial charge (IC) will be calculated with the following formula: 
IC = jV + V(a(BOD -200*) + b(SS 200*)) 
IC = Industrial charge per month 
V = Volume discharged in millions of gallons per month 
j = Basic rate $40.00 per million gallons treated per month 
a = BOD surcharge factor (dollars per million gallons per milligram per liter) based on the treatment costs attributable to the removal of BOD= $0.10 
BOD = Five-day @ 20* C. BOD of the industrial wastes (mg/l) to be measured at intervals from composite samples 
b = SS surcharge factor (dollars per million gallons per milligram per liter) based on the treatment costs attributable to the removal of SS = $0.04 
SS = Suspended solids of the industrial waste (mg/l) to be measured at intervals from composite samples 
* The assumed concentration of BOD and SS in "normal" domestic wastewater is 200 mg/l. 
Basis of calculation: 
Annual capital cost: Collection system @ 2%, 50 yr ..... $44,000.00 
Annual capital cost: Treatment plant @ 5%, 20 yr ..... 60,000.00 
Plant operation and maintenance (annual) ..... 93,000.00 
33% of O&M attributable to BOD removal. 
10% of O&M attributable to SS removal. 
Industrial charges: 
Basic Charge per/million gals. treated ..... $40.00 
Cost per pound BOD Removal ..... 0.0122 
Surcharge (BOD greater than 200 mg/l): 1 mg/l Per Million Gals. Treated/Mo ..... .0.10 
Cost per pound SS Removal ..... 0.005 
Surcharge - (SS greater than 200 mg/l): 1 mg/l per Million Gals. 
Treated/Mo ..... 0.04 
(d)  The following supplemental cost recovery system is hereby adopted and shall be applied to industrial users contributing wastes having oil and grease levels in excess of 100 mg/I. For industrial users contributing wastes having oil and grease levels exceeding 100 mg/I, the industrial charge (IC) will be calculated with the following formula: 
IC = jV + V(a(BOD-200) + b(SS-200) + c(OG-100)) 
c = Oil and grease surcharge factor (dollars per million gallons per milligram per liter) based on the treatment costs attributable to the removal of oil and grease = $0.92. 
OG = Oil and grease of the industrial waste (mg/l) to be measured at intervals as prescribed by the director. 
All other definitions are the same as stated in subsection (c) of this section.

E.  Landscape plan review. A landscape plan shall include the type and location of all living plants and irrigation system components. This plan shall be submitted in conjunction with the site plan during the building permit application and shall be reviewed and approved by planning and zoning staff in accordance with this ordinance. Changes to the landscaping during construction will require approval prior to planting. 
F.  Installation. In order to receive a certificate of occupancy the irrigation system and all landscaping must be in place in accordance with the approved landscape plan. Only one temporary certificate of occupancy (maximum of 60 days) may be granted to complete the landscaping. 
G.  Maintenance. It is the property owner's responsibility to maintain all landscaped areas, including public rights-of-way and sight triangles in a healthy, neat, trimmed, clean, and weed-free condition, whether or not negligence or damage to the landscaping was the cause of the owner. Dead plant material shall be replaced with new plant material in accordance with this article within 60 days of receiving written notice from city staff.

Sec. 2. - Policy. 
1.  It is hereby declared to be the policy of the City of Roswell that the subdivision of land and its subsequent development are subject to the control of the city pursuant to the comprehensive master plan and its components heretofore duly adopted and approved for the orderly, planned, efficient, and economical development of the city. 
2.  Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used safely for building purposes without danger to health or peril from fire, flood, or other menace, and land shall not be subdivided until adequate public facilities and improvements exist and proper provision has been made for drainage, water, sewerage, and capital improvements such as schools, parks, recreation facilities, transportation facilities, and other public improvements. 
3.  The existing and proposed public improvements shall conform to and be properly related to the proposals shown in the comprehensive master plan, functional street classification map, land use plan, public works specifications and the capital improvements budget and program of the City of Roswell.

4.  Land that has been subdivided prior to the effective date of this ordinance should, whenever possible, be brought within the scope of this ordinance to further the purposes of the regulations in section 3. 
5.  For the purposes of the Roswell Subdivision Ordinance, the City of Roswell as a planning authority under NMSA 1978, § 3-19-1, retains to the city council as the governing body the power, authority, jurisdiction and duty conferred upon the city as the planning authority for purposes of the approval or disapprove of plats and subdivisions as provided under NMSA 1978, ch. 3, art. 20 and this subdivision ordinance.

2.  To guide the future growth and development of the City of Roswell in accordance with the comprehensive master plan. 
3.  To provide for adequate light, air, and privacy; to secure safety from fire, flood, and other dangers; and to prevent overcrowding of the land and undue congestion of population. 
4.  To protect the character and the social and economic stability of all parts of the City of Roswell and to encourage the orderly and beneficial development of the community through appropriate planning, assuring the timing and sequencing of development; to promote infill development in existing neighborhoods and non-residential areas with adequate public facilities; to allow for open space provisions; and to protect environmentally critical areas and areas premature for urban development. 
5.  To protect and conserve the value of land throughout the city and the value of buildings and improvements upon the land, and to minimize the conflicts among the uses of land and buildings. 
6.  To guide public and private policy and action in order to provide adequate and efficient transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, recreation, and other public requirements, and facilities. 
7.  To provide the most beneficial relationship between the uses of land and buildings and the circulation of traffic throughout the city, having particular regard to the avoidance of congestion in the streets and highways and the pedestrian traffic movements appropriate to the various uses of land and buildings; to encourage the use of traffic calming and alternative methods of transportation; to provide for the proper location and width of streets and building lines.

9.  To ensure that public facilities and services are available concurrent with development, and that sufficient capacity exists to serve the proposed subdivision; and to ensure that the community will be required to bear no more than its fair share of the cost of providing the facilities and services through requiring the developer to pay fees, furnish land, or establish mitigation measures to ensure that the development provides its fair share of capital facilities needs generated by the development. 
10.  To prevent the pollution of air, streams, and ponds; to ensure the adequacy of drainage facilities; to safeguard the water table, and to encourage the wise use and management of natural resources throughout the city in order to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the community and the value of the land.

13.  To ensure that land is subdivided only when subdivision is necessary to provide for uses of land where market demand exists and which are in the public interest. 
14.  To remedy the problems associated with inappropriately subdivided lands, including premature subdivision, excess subdivision, partial or incomplete subdivision, and scattered and low-grade subdivision. 
Sec. 4. - Scope and jurisdiction. 
    The regulations as set forth in this ordinance shall apply to all subdivision of land, as defined herein, located within the corporate limits of the city and, as defined by the county, within the five mile planning and platting jurisdiction of the city, and the vacation and/or dedication to the city or other public entity of any street, easement, or right-of-way in the city. 
    Land unsuitable for subdivision development due to drainage, flood hazard area, topography, or other conditions constituting a danger to health, life, or property shall not be approved unless the subdivider presents evidence or data to the city establishing that the methods proposed to meet any such conditions are satisfactory to adequately avoid any danger to health, life, or property.

Sec. 7. - Severability. 
    If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or part hereof is for any reason declared unconstitutional or invalid, the validity of the remaining portions hereof shall not be affected since it is the express intent of the City of Roswell to pass each section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase, and every part thereof separately and independently of every other part.

MAJOR SUBDIVISION APPLICATION & APPROVAL PROCESS 

MINOR SUBDIVISION APPLICATION & APPROVAL PROCESS 

SUMMARY SUBDIVISION APPLICATION & APPROVAL PROCESS

ARTICLE 5. - DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 1. - General. 
A.  Conformance to applicable rules and regulations. In addition to requirements established herein, all subdivision plats shall comply with the following laws, rules, and regulations: 
1.  The City of Roswell Zoning Ordinance; 
2.  The comprehensive master plan, and functional street classification plan; 
3.  The rules and regulations in the City of Roswell Public Works Specifications, or as amended, and where not in conflict with this ordinance; 
4.  The regulations of the New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department if the subdivision or any lot contained therein abuts a state highway; and 
5.  The standards and regulations adopted by the City of Roswell. 
B.  Suitability of land. Land which the planning and zoning commission finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or development because of flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements, or other features which will reasonably be harmful to the safety, health, and general welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its surrounding areas, shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer and approved by the city council, to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions. Such land shall be set aside for uses as are appropriate to existing conditions. 
Sec. 2. - Lot improvements. 
A.  Lot arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the zoning ordinance and in providing driveway access to buildings on the lots from an approved street. 
B.  Lot dimensions. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of the zoning ordinance. Where lots are more than double the minimum required area for the zoning district, the planning and zoning commission may require that those lots be arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets where they would be necessary to serve potential lots, all in compliance with the zoning ordinance and these regulations. In general, side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines (or radial to curbing street lines) unless a variation from this rule will give a better street or lot. Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for erection of buildings, observing the minimum setbacks from both streets. Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for business, commercial, or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and development contemplated, as established in the zoning ordinance. 
C.  Lot orientation. The lot line common to the street right-of-way shall be the front line. The front line of corner lots shall be the lot line with the narrower dimension. All lots shall face the front line and a similar line across the street. Wherever feasible, lots shall be arranged so that the rear line does not abut the side line of an adjacent lot. 
D.  Double frontage lots and access to lots. 
1.  Double frontage and reversed frontage lots are strongly discouraged and shall be avoided except where necessary to provide separation of residential development from arterial streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. 
2.  Residential lots shall not, in general, derive access exclusively from arterial streets. Residential multi-family uses may have limited access to arterial streets. Where driveway access from an arterial street may be necessary for several adjoining lots, the planning and zoning commission shall require that such lots be served by a frontage road in order to limit possible traffic hazards. 
3.  Multi-family developments, special uses, commercial or industrial lots shall be designed and arranged so as to prohibit driveways requiring vehicles to back into streets. 
E.  Lot proportions. Lot depth shall not, where practical, exceed three times the lot width. Lots too shallow for construction purposes shall likewise be avoided. 
F.  Lot drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all buildings. Individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid increased concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent lots (see article 5, section 4). 
Sec. 3. - Streets. 
A.  General requirements. 
1.  All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed system of thoroughfares as established by the functional street classification plan. 
2.  Local streets shall be laid out to conform as much as possible to the topography to discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property. 
3.  Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions, or unless in the opinion of the city council, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous future development on adjacent tracts. 
4.  Land reserved for any street purposes shall not be counted in satisfying yard or area requirements of the zoning ordinance. 
B.  Blocks. 
1.  Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be permitted in blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads, or waterways. 
2.  The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated, but block lengths in residential areas shall not exceed 1,500 feet nor be less than 400 feet in length. 
3.  In long blocks, the planning and zoning commission and/or city council may require the reservation of an easement through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities, emergency access, or pedestrian traffic. 
4.  Pedestrianways or crosswalks, not less than ten feet wide, may be required by the planning and zoning commission and/or city council through the center of blocks more than 800 feet long where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, or other community facilities. Blocks designed for industrial uses shall be of such length and width as may be determined suitable by the planning and zoning commission and/or city council for prospective use. 
C.  Access to principal and minor arterial streets. Where a residential subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed principal or minor arterial street, access shall be limited by one of the following means: 
1.  The subdivision of lots so as to back onto the primary arterial and front onto a parallel local street. No access shall be provided from the arterial. 
2.  A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel street, with the rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto the arterial street. 
3.  A series of local streets at right angles to the arterial with abutting lots arranged to side rather than front the street right-of-way. 
4.  A frontage road separated from the arterial by a planting or grass strip. 
D.  Design standards. 
1.  General. Streets, alley pads, driveways, and entrances shall be of suitable location, width, and thickness to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access to police, fire protection, sanitation, and road-maintenance equipment, and be coordinated so as to compose a convenient system and avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties. Design standards for streets alleys, driveways, drainage and utility systems are included in the City of Roswell Public Works Specification. Minimum street right-of-way widths shall be as shown in the following table. Street classifications shall be as described in the City of Roswell Functional Street Classification Plan: 
MINIMUM STREET RIGHTS-OF-WAY Street Classification Minimum Width of Right-of-Way Dimensions in Feet Local Street 60 Collector Street 65 Minor Arterial 80 Principal Arterial 100  
2.  Street surfacing and improvements. After utilities have been installed by the developer, the applicant shall construct curbs and gutters and shall surface or cause to be surfaced roadways to the widths prescribed in the public works specification. Said surfacing shall be of such character as is suitable for the expected traffic and in harmony with similar improvements in the surrounding areas. Street sections shall conform to standards and specifications adopted by the City of Roswell Public Works Specifications. Adequate provision shall be made for culverts, drains, and bridges. 
All pavements, shoulders, drainage improvements and structures, curbs, turnarounds, and sidewalks shall conform to the City of Roswell Public Works Specifications, and shall be incorporated into the construction plans required to be submitted by the developer for subdivision acceptance. 
3.  Railroads and controlled access highways. Railroad rights-of-way and controlled access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands shall be treated as follows: 
a.  In residential districts, a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth, in addition to the required setback limits of the lot, shall be provided adjacent to railroad right-of-way or controlled access highways. 
b.  In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses, the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites. 
4.  Intersections. 
a.  Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an angle of less than 75 degrees shall not be acceptable. An oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at least 100 feet therefrom. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point. 
b.  Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet shall not be permitted. 
c.  Alley intersections and abrupt changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular movement. 
5.  Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined by the city council, shall be constructed at the full expense of the applicant without reimbursement from the City of Roswell. The sharing expense for the construction of bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant as determined by the city council, will be fixed by special agreement between the city council and the applicant. 
6.  Alleys. Alleys are to be provided. Their minimum right-of-way width shall not be less than 20 feet; alleys in commercial and industrial subdivisions shall be 25 feet in width. The type of surface shall conform to the City of Roswell Public Works Specifications. 
E.  Street dedications and improvements. 
1.  Widening and realignment of streets. 
a.  Where a subdivision is adjacent to a street which, in accordance with the functional street classification plan, shall be widened, the subdivider shall dedicate, at his or her own expense, a proportionate share of the additional right-of-way width. 
b.  Where, in accordance with the functional street classification plan, a street shall lie wholly within a subdivision, the subdivider shall, at his or her expense, dedicate the entire right-of-way width and improve the full width of the street. 
2.  New perimeter streets. Street systems in new subdivisions shall be laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half-streets. Where an existing half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the remaining half of the street shall be improved and dedicated by the subdivider. The city may authorize a new perimeter street where the subdivider dedicates and improves the entire required street right-of-way width within the subdivision boundaries. 
3.  Frontage roads. Where a frontage road is proposed, its full width shall be dedicated and improved as required by this ordinance at the full expense of the subdivider. 
Sec. 4. - Drainage and storm sewers. 
A.  General requirements. The planning and zoning commission shall not recommend for approval any subdivision plat which does not make adequate provision for storm or floodwater runoff channels or basins. The stormwater drainage system shall be separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm drainage shall be accommodated in the streets and gutters unless adopted standards and specifications would indicate otherwise. Where storm sewers are required, the cost may, at the option of the city, be shared between the City of Roswell and the applicant where it is determined that off-site drainage is served. 
1.  Accommodation of upstream drainage areas. A culvert, gutter, or other drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the subdivision. The subdivider's engineer shall determine, in accordance with adopted standards and specifications, the necessary size of the facility, based on the provisions of the construction standards and specifications, assuming conditions of maximum potential development within the watershed as permitted by the zoning ordinance. 
2.  Effect on downstream drainage area. The subdivider's engineer shall also study the effect of each subdivision on existing downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision. Local government drainage studies, together with such other studies as shall be appropriate, shall serve as a guide to needed improvements. Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage facility, the city council may withhold approval of the subdivision until provision has been made for the improvement of said potential condition in such sum as the city council shall determine. No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be provided to an adequate drainage watercourse or facility. 
3.  Floodplain areas. The city council may, when it deems it necessary for the health, safety, or welfare of the present and future population of the area, and necessary to the conservation of water, drainage, and sanitary facilities, prohibit the subdivision of any portion of the property which lies within the floodplain of any stream as determined in the city's floodplain ordinance. These floodplain areas shall be preserved from any and all destruction or damage resulting from clearing, grading, or dumping of earth, waste material, or stumps, except at the discretion of the Chaves County Flood Commissioner and City of Roswell Floodplain Administrator. 
B.  Dedication of drainage easements. 
1.  General requirements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream, a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way shall be provided conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and of such width and construction, or both, as will be adequate. 
2.  Drainage easements. 
a.  Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within street rights-of-way, perpetual unobstructed easements at least 20 feet in width for such drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside the street lines and with satisfactory access to the street. Easements shall be indicated on the plat. Drainage easements shall be carried from the street to a natural watercourse or to other drainage facilities. 
b.  When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and indicated on the plat. 
c.  Storm drainage design, analysis and reports shall be performed and submitted in accordance with the City of Roswell Public Works Specifications. 
Sec. 5. - Water facilities. 
A.  General requirements. 
1.  Where public or approved central water supply is available, a system shall be designed by a registered engineer to furnish an adequate supply of water to each lot, with adequate main size and fire hydrant locations to serve the area. Such systems shall be approved by the city engineer, in accordance with the City of Roswell Public Works Specifications. At the time of subdivision, the subdivider will be advised of the city's policy regarding extension of city facilities. 
2.  Where public or approved central water supply is unavailable, water systems shall be designed by a registered engineer and shall be approved by the city engineer in accordance with the requirements of city and state authorities having jurisdiction. 
B.  Fire hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be required for all subdivisions. Fire hydrants shall be located in accordance with the city fire department specifications. To eliminate future street openings, all underground utilities for fire hydrants, together with the fire hydrants themselves and all other supply improvements, shall be installed before any final paving of a street shown on a subdivision plat. 
C.  Fire lines. Where fire lines are proposed to serve individual lots, such lines shall be installed by the developer at the time of lot development, at the expense of the lot developer. Ownership and maintenance of the fire lines are the responsibility of the lot owner. 
Sec. 6. - Sewer systems. 
A.  Public sewer lines available. Where public sewer lines are available or definitely planned, sanitary sewer lines shall be designed to connect to each lot. 
B.  Public sewage system required. Sanitary sewage facilities shall connect with public sanitary sewage system unless such connection is not available. 
1.  Where public sanitary sewage systems are not accessible and will not become available within a reasonable period of time, the applicant may install sewage systems as follows: 
a.  Low, medium and high-density residential districts: A central sewage system only. No individual disposal system will be permitted. 
b.  Rural suburban district (very low-density residential): Individual disposal systems or central sewage systems shall be used in accordance with state environmental department specifications. 
C.  Design criteria for sanitary sewers. 
1.  Design factors. Sanitary sewer systems shall be designed by a registered engineer for the ultimate tributary population. System design as related to size, slope, depth, alignment, manhole locations, sewer line location and cleanouts should be in conformance with City of Roswell Public Works specifications. 
Sec. 7. - Sidewalks. 
A.  Required improvements. 
1.  Sidewalks shall be included with the dedicated non-pavement right-of-way of all streets, and shall be installed prior to the occupancy of the lot of which the sidewalk serves. 
2.  Concrete sidewalks shall be placed either flush with the curb, or at the property line in accordance with the City of Roswell Public Works Specifications. 
3.  In dedicated pedestrian accessways, sidewalks shall be constructed in order to facilitate pedestrian access from the roads to schools, parks, playgrounds, or other nearby roads. Such sidewalks shall be constructed by the developer at the time of street construction. 
Sec. 8. - Utilities. 
A.  Location. All utility facilities, including but not limited to gas, electric power, telephone, and cable television, should be located underground throughout the subdivision wherever possible. 
B.  Easements. Easements shall not split lot lines and shall be located as required by the city and/or applicable utility companies. 
Sec. 9. - Public uses. 
A.  Parks, playgrounds, and recreation areas. 
1.  Where the city's comprehensive master plan indicates the need for the location of a park, playground, or recreation area within the general vicinity of the property being subdivided, the subdivider shall work with the city to make provisions for the location and acquisition of said area. 
2.  As a condition of approval of a final plat of a subdivision, the subdivider shall be required to dedicate to the city for park, playground, or recreational purposes, an area of land comprising 8% of the total area being subdivided with said land to be located within the subdivision itself or, if the subdivider has land holdings elsewhere, no further than one mile from the borders of the proposed subdivision. The park area shall not be less than five acres in size. 
3.  In lieu of this land dedication, or if the 8% calculation results in a park site less than five acres in size, the subdivider, property owner, or developer shall pay a cash contribution to the city in the amount of $2.00 per foot of the subdivision's street frontage to be used strictly for future park site acquisition and improvements. 
B.  Schools. The planning and zoning department shall forward to the school district, the pre-application sketches for all requests for major subdivisions of 40 acres or more. The school district may assess the request to determine the need for additional school sites and may work with the developer to acquire such sites. 
Sec. 10. - Preservation of natural features and amenities.
