Sec. 151 The lawful use of any building, structure, land or premises as existing and lawful at the time of enactment of this Resolution or amendment thereto, may be continued although such use does not conform with the provisions of this Resolution or amendment. If no structural alterations are made (other than as provided for in Sec. 184.8-7 of this Resolution), a non-conforming use of a building may be changed to another non-conforming use of the same or of a more restricted classification. Whenever a non-conforming use has been changed to a more restricted use or a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restricted use.
Sec. 152 Whenever the use of any building, structure, land or premises becomes non-conforming through an amendment to this Resolution or Maps, such use may be continued and, if no structural alterations are made (other than as provided for in Sec. 184.8-7 of this Resolution), it may be changed to another non-conforming use of the same or of a more restricted classification.

ARTICLE XVI
COMMUNITY UNIT PLAN
Sec. 160 The purpose of the CUP Overlay District is to encourage the efficient
use of land and resources, promoting greater efficiency in providing
public and utility services, and encouraging innovation in the planning
and building of all types of development and renewal by accommodating
developments which are planned so as to integrate residential use with
collateral uses, and in which lot size, setback lines, yard areas, and
dwelling types may be varied and modified to achieve particular design
objectives and make provision for open space, common areas, utilities,
public improvements, and collateral uses.
Sec. 161 The owners of any tract of land comprising an area of not less than five
acres may submit to the Commission a plan for the use and development
of the tract of land for residential and related purposes as hereinafter
provided in Section 162.3.
Sec. 162 Per Ohio Revised Code (ORC) Sec. 519.07, the Delhi Township Zoning Commission may transmit a copy of the plan and any supplemental materials to the Hamilton County Regional Planning Commission.
a) If transmitted to the Hamilton County Regional Planning Commission, within five days after the official filing of the plan, the Township Zoning Commission shall transmit a copy of the plan and any supporting documentation to the Hamilton County Regional Planning Commission for report and recommendation. The Hamilton County Regional Planning Commission shall recommend the approval or denial of the plan or some modification thereof and shall submit such recommendation to the Township Zoning Commission.

b) All plans, whether or not transmitted to the Hamilton County Regional Planning Commission shall abide by the official filing procedures listed in Section 163.
c) Any report from the Hamilton County Regional Planning Commission or the Township Zoning Commission shall state the reasons for the recommendation and shall evaluate such plan based upon compliance with the following conditions:
Sec. 162.1 That the location and planning of building sites and the amount,
arrangement and treatment of open space will ensure a satisfactory living
environment and will be carried out in consideration of property
adjacent to the area included in the plan and insure that such adjacent
property will not be adversely affected.
Sec. 162.2 That the plan is consistent with the objectives of this Article to further
the best use of the land in relation to its size, configuration, location and
physiography, and to produce a residential environment of sustained
desirability.
Sec. 162.3 That the buildings shall be used only for single family detached
Zoning Resolution, Delhi Township, Ohio 72
dwellings and such accessory buildings and uses customarily incident to
such use if the area of the community unit plan is less than 10 acres; or
only for detached or attached single family, two family or multiple
dwellings, or other residentially related activities and customary
accessory uses if the area of the community unit plan is more than 10
acres in area and if approved by the Township Zoning Commission for
such use. In the case of a community unit plan of 30 acres or more, one
(1) area may be approved in such a plan as a shopping center for parking
and commercial buildings and uses as regulated in "E “Retail Business
District not to exceed one (1) acre for each one hundred (100) lots or
dwelling units or fraction thereof.
Sec. 162.3-1 In a case where the topography or other physical features of the tract or
its relation to surrounding property make complete compliance with the
minimum area requirements, as prescribed in Section 162.3, unnecessary
or undesirable, the Township Zoning Commission may modify such
requirements to the extent warranted by such physical conditions
provided the surrounding property and the public welfare are adequately
protected.
Sec. 162.4 That the average lot area per family contained in the site, excluding
rights-of-way and access easements, will not be less than the lot area per
family required in the District in which the development is located.
Sec. 163 Upon the official filing of such plan, the Township Zoning Commission
shall set a date for a hearing on the plan. The date of the public hearing
shall not be less than twenty nor more than forty days from the date of
the official filing of the plan. Notice of the hearing shall be given by the
Township Zoning Commission by one publication in one or more
newspapers of general circulation in the Township at least ten (10) days
before the date of such hearing. Written notice of the hearing shall be
mailed by the Township Zoning Commission, by first class mail, at least
ten (10) days before the date of the public hearing to all owners of
property within and contiguous to, directly across the street from, and
within 200' of such tract, to the addresses of such owners appearing on
the County Auditor's current tax list. The failure of delivery of such
notice shall not invalidate these proceedings.
The published and mailed notices shall set forth the time and place of the
hearing, a brief summary of the plan, and a statement that the plan will
be referred to the Board of Trustees for further determination.
Sec. 164 Within thirty (30) days of the conclusion of its hearing, the Township
Zoning Commission shall recommend the approval, denial, or modification of the plan and submit such recommendation together with
the plan and all documentation thereon to the Board of Trustees for
public hearing as provided for amendments or supplements to the
Township Zoning Resolution in accordance with Sec. 519.12 of the Ohio
Revised Code, provided, however, that no approval of a community unit
plan as being in compliance with the standards of approval established
under this Article shall be considered to be an amendment or supplement
Zoning Resolution, Delhi Township, Ohio 73
to the Township Zoning Resolution for the purpose of Section 519.12 of
the Ohio Revised Code.
Sec. 165 The Board of Trustees, upon official receipt of such recommendation,
shall set a date and time for a hearing on the proposed plan, which date
shall not be more than thirty (30) days from the date of the official
receipt of the recommendation of the Township Zoning Commission.
Notice of the hearing shall be given by the Board by one publication in
one or more newspapers of general circulation in the township at least
ten (10) days before the date of such hearing.
Sec. 166 Within twenty (20) days after such public hearing the Board of Trustees
shall either approve or deny the recommendation of the Commission or
adopt some modification thereof. In the event that the Board of Trustees
deny or modify the recommendation of the Township Zoning
Commission the majority vote of the Board of Trustees shall be required.
Sec. 167 If the Board of Trustees approve the plan, then zoning certificates may
be issued even though the use of land, the location of the buildings to be
erected in the area, and the yards and open spaces contemplated by the
plan do not conform in all respects to the District Regulations of the
District in which it is located. The Board of Trustees may also by the
same procedure, authorize the revision or remodeling of any existing
community unit plan that does not conform in all respects with the
District Regulations of this Resolution.
Sec. 167.1 No zoning certificate shall be issued for actual construction of any
development that does not conform in all respects with the underlying
residence District Regulation in which the site is located until and unless
a Final Development Plan, as defined in Section 31.14, shall have been
reviewed and approved by the Township Zoning Commission with the
determination that such plan is consistent with the approved plan and the
purposes and intent of this Article. The Township Zoning Commission
may approve variations in the Final Development Plan not in violation of
any standards and requirements prescribed in this Article, and provided
that the variations remain completely in harmony with the approved plan
and in the spirit of the Resolution. The Township Zoning Commission
may take into consideration the recommendation of the staff of the
Regional Planning Commission.
Sec. 168 Application may be filed for amendment of the underlying Residence
District map coincidentally with the Community Unit Plan Overlay
District in accordance with the Article. In this case, the application for
amendment of the zoning classification and the plan for the use and
development of the tract of land may be considered together and the
hearings and recommendation therefor may be combined.
Sec. 169 The development plan approved in accordance with this Article and
Article XIII-F shall be an integral part of the Zoning Resolution and any
departure from the plan or any modification thereof except when
Zoning Resolution, Delhi Township, Ohio 74
specifically approved in accordance with Article XIII-F shall be a
violation of said Zoning Resolution and shall be subject to the provisions
and penalties prescribed therefor in Article XXVIII.

2. Where owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the Resolution will result in an unnecessary hardship; and
3. The spirit of the Resolution will be observed and substantial justice done in the granting of the variance; and
4. Whether the special circumstances and conditions result from the actions of the property owner or any other of the predecessors in title; and
5. Whether the landowner acquired the property with knowledge of the present zoning classification
6. Whether the property is suitable to any permitted uses as zoned, including whether there are some other profitable alternatives for the property, even if different from the applicant’s desired use; and
7. Whether the alleged hardship is merely an inability to make more money from the use of the subject property, as contrasted from the situation where the property is unsuitable for any of the permitted uses in the governing zoning district.
B. Area Variance.
1. Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of the zoning restrictions; and
2. Whether the property owner’s predicament feasibly can be obviated through some other method than a variance; and
3. Whether the variance is substantial; and
4. Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a substantial detriment as a result of the variance; and
5. Whether the property in questions will yield a reasonable return or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance; and
Zoning Resolution, Delhi Township, Ohio 86
6. Whether the variance adversely affects the delivery of government services; and
7. Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance.

Sec. 185 In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the Board may reverse or
affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all powers of the Officer from whom the appeal is taken.
Sec. 186 The Board shall act by resolution, in which three (3) members concur
and every variation granted or denied shall be accompanied by a written finding of fact, based on testimony and evidence and specifying the reason for granting or denying the variance.

Sec. 32.05 Existing Uses
The long-range implementation of the Delhi Township Strategic Redevelopment Plan requires sensitive treatment of existing uses that represent significant investments in the Township. While it is the intent of the DPBC for development to ultimately meet the building and use requirements of this Article, it is the intent of this section to permit existing uses to continue and to be considered conforming to this code, even if the use or the building type is not otherwise permitted in the District, provided that the following requirements are met:
Zoning Resolution, Delhi Township, Ohio 117
1) All uses that were permitted under the zoning of a property immediately prior to its rezoning to DPBC shall continue to be allowed as permitted on the property. However, if an existing use is voluntarily discontinued for two (2) or more years, any future use of the property shall be in conformity with this Article. Expansions of uses within existing structures, as permitted by Sec. 184.8-7, shall be permitted on the property provided that at least one of the permitted uses under the prior zoning has been operated continuously in an existing structure and/or associated use areas on the property within the 12 months prior to the rezoning of the property to DPBC.
2) Once a use that complies with the DPBC is established on a lot or parcel and all existing uses have been abandoned or voluntarily discontinued, no non-DPBC use of the prior zoning district may be re-established.
a) For parcels with a single existing structure configured as a multi-tenant building, once the entire multi-tenant building is abandoned, demolished and/or all tenant spaces have established uses under the DPBC, no non-DPBC use of the prior zoning district may be re-established.
b) For parcels with multiple existing structures, only after all buildings have been abandoned, demolished and/or all buildings have established uses under the DPBC, no non-DPBC use of the prior zoning district may be re-established.

Sec. 32.07 Parking Standards
Off-street parking and loading facilities shall be provided as required in Article XIV including dimensional standards, screening requirements, maintenance, bicycle parking, accessible parking spaces, and other similar requirements, except as provided in this section.
1) In mixed-use or large-scale developments, the Community Development Director may modify the number of required parking spaces up to 50 percent of the number required per Table 143-1, if the applicant submits a parking analysis that outlines the proposed square footages of each use in the development, number of expected employees, shared parking, cross-access agreements, and any other information that is relative to the parking calculation, along with the number of available off-street and on-street parking spaces provided for on the site plan. Written justification shall describe why the proposed number of parking spaces will be sufficient to accommodate the expected parking demand.
2) Shared parking and cross-access agreements shall be utilized when there are excess spaces available on one site which can be used toward parking requirements on an adjacent property. Such agreements shall be limited to properties within the DPBC.
3) Loading spaces are not required within the DPBC. When a developer choses to include loading spaces within a proposed development, such spaces shall conform to the dimensional and material standards of Sec. 144.
Sec. 32.08 Site Design
The following site design elements provide a framework for development and redevelopment projects within the district. These elements shall be required whenever feasible, but may be waived by the Community Development Director if appropriate justification is provided by the applicant.
1) Redevelopment projects and new development projects shall be constructed in a campus-style format, where feasible, with a mixture of uses in a walkable and attractive development.

ADDENDUM “1”
STATEMENT OF INTENT AND FINDINGS RELATED TO
SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES AND
ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS
(I) PURPOSE AND INTENT 1
(A) In initiating Amendment ZC2016-1to the Zoning Resolution, the Zoning Commission makes the following statement of intent and findings:
(1) Adult entertainment establishments require special supervision from the public safety agencies of Delhi Township in order to protect and preserve the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the patrons and employees of the businesses as well as the citizens of Delhi Township.
(2) The Zoning Commission finds that adult entertainment establishments are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature.
(3) The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of Delhi Township that demands reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments by Delhi Township in the specified manner, and expanded authority for reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments by local governments, in order to protect the health and well-being of the citizens.
(4) There is convincing documented evidence that adult entertainment establishments, because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them, cause increased crime, particularly in the overnight hours, and downgrade property values.
(5) The Zoning Commission desires to minimize and control these adverse effects by regulating adult entertainment establishments in the specified manner. And by minimizing and controlling these adverse effects, the Zoning Commission seeks to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry; protect the citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the spread of urban blight.
(6) The Zoning Commission has determined that current local zoning and other locational criteria do not adequately protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of Delhi Township and that expanded regulation of adult entertainment establishments is necessary.
1 This was adapted from the Purpose and Intent version included in the Model Ordinance regulating Sexually Oriented Businesses prepared by the Attorney General per the General Assembly's directive in HB No. 23 (2006) and SB No. 16 (2007).
Zoning Resolution, Delhi Township, Ohio 152
(7) It is not the intent of the Zoning Commission in making its recommendations regarding codification of the Plan to suppress or authorize the suppression of any speech activities protected by the First Amendment, but to enact content-neutral statutes that address the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments.
(8) It is not the intent of the Zoning Commission to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material, and the Zoning Commission recognizes that state and federal law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and expects and encourages state law enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes against any such illegal activities in this state.
(B) It is the intent of the Zoning Commission in adopting the Motion to regulate in the specified manner adult entertainment establishments in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of Delhi Township and establish reasonable regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments within Delhi Township. The provisions of this Motion have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent of the Zoning Commission in enacting this Motion to restrict or deny, or authorize the restriction or denial of, access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny, or authorize the denial of, access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult entertainment and adult materials to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of the Zoning Commission in enacting this Motion to condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of obscene material.
(C) Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on communities presented in hearings and in reports made available to the legislature and subsequently adopted by the Ohio General Assembly as findings under Section 3 of House Bill 23 (and on findings incorporated in the cases of Township of Littleton, Colorado v. Z.J. Gifts D-4, L.L.C. (2004), 541 U.S. 774; Township of Erie v. Pap's A.M. (2000), 529 U.S. 277; Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc. (1991), 501 U.S. 560; Township of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.

Rec. S. 8987; 135 Cong. Rec. S. 14519; 135 Cong. Rec. S. 5636, 134 Cong. Rec. E. 3750; and also on findings from the paper entitled “Stripclubs According to Strippers: Exposing Workplace Sexual Violence,” by Kelly Holsopple, Program Director, Freedom and Justice Center for Prostitution Resources, Minneapolis, Minnesota; and from “Sexually Oriented Businesses: An Insider's View,” by David Sherman, presented to the Michigan House Committee on Ethics and Constitutional Law, Jan. 12, 2000; and from various other police reports, testimony, newspaper reports, and other documentary evidence), and subsequent findings in Sensations, Inc. v. City of Grand Rapids, Michigan Decency Action Council (6th Cir. 2008), 526 F.3d 291; 729, Inc. v. Kenton County Fiscal Court (6th Cir. 2008), 515 F.3d 485; and Andy's Rest. & Lounge, Inc. v. City of Gary (7th Cir. 2006), 466 F.3d 550, and the Zoning Commission’s acknowledgement of the same the Zoning Commission finds:
(1) Adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments.
(2) Certain employees of adult entertainment establishments, as defined in Delhi Zoning Resolution as adult theaters and cabarets, engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
(3) Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at adult entertainment establishments, especially those that provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. The “couch dances” or “lap dances” that frequently occur in adult entertainment establishments featuring live nude or seminude dancers constitute or may constitute the offense of “engaging in prostitution” under Section 2907.25 of the Revised Code.
(4) Offering and providing private or semi-private booths or cubicles encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.
(5) Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity within the premises of those adult entertainment establishments.
Zoning Resolution, Delhi Township, Ohio 154
(6) Numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis salmonella, campylobacter and shigella infections, chlamydial, myoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections, trichomoniasis, and chancroid.
(7) Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States: 600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983, 4,600 in 1984, 8,555 in 1985, and 253,448 through December 31, 1992.
(8) A total of 10,255 AIDS cases had been reported in Ohio as of January 1999. Ohio has required HIV case reporting since 1990, and the reported information shows 7,969 people living with (HIV) (4,213) and (AIDS) (3,756) in the state.
(9) Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test in Ohio.
(10) The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the Unites States reported annually has risen. 33,613 cases were reported in 1982, and 45,200 cases were reported through November 1990.
(11) The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases being reported in 1990.
(12) The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, and exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn.
(13) According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
(14) Sanitary conditions in some adult entertainment establishments are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities.
(15) The findings noted in divisions (C)(1) to (14) above raise substantial governmental concerns.
(16) Adult entertainment establishments have operational characteristics that require or mandate reasonable government regulation in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
(17) The enactment of the proposed regulations will promote the general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of Delhi Township.
